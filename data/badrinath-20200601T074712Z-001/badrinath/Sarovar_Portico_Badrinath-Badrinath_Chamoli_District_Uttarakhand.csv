badrinath,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights in October 2019.  The hotel is located very near the entrance to Badrinath as you drive up from Joshimath.   The main Badrinath Temple is, however,  too far to walk from the hotel.  You definitely need a vehicle to go to the temple and the town.  The people at the reception counter were very helpful and friendly.  It was rather cold during the time of our visit.  So we asked for a room heater, but the heater they gave us was not very effective.  However, what really saved us was the heated mattress which was very effective.  Without this, we would not have had a good stay in the hotel.  In fact, the presence of heated mattress in the hotel rooms was the prime reason for us to select this hotel in the first place !

badrinath,The hotel certainly could use a major makeover. Since there is no central heating the rooms and the rest of the hotel was cold. The elevator barely worked. However it probably is as decent an option as any if one is planning to visit the temple.,asiahand1,/Profile/asiahand1,Florida,30
badrinath,"I stayed for a night with family. It was pretty cold when we reached in the afternoon around 3 deg C and we requested for a room heater and we were provided a hot air blower and honestly that wasn't really sufficient. However, the hotel had heaters in the bed which was a savior for us. The hotel is otherwise pretty neat and clean and pretty well decorated and provided good service and advice wrt temple darshan and even provided us a leaflet with the charges.   The view of the dazzling Neelkanth in the morning and always able to see snow covered peaks as a window view is an obvious plus!

The light fixtures and plug points don't work and the carpet smells musty.the wall paper and paints have peeled off..the bathroom doesn't drain water properly. To add to this, we had a rodent visitor to our room who had to be trapped using a rat trap. To be fair, the hotel did give us a discount to account for the rat problem but it had to be demanded and was not forthcoming.While I understand that the place is closed for 6 months every year and is located at such a challenging location.. it is still no excuse for such maintenance.

Where things went wrong - people. People were not very friendly. Cafeteria staff was not in the mood to serve. Food was good...  The rooms are run down. The walls were peeling paint and were wet. Rooms are cold - they did give us space heaters.   I am not sure there are better options in the area.

badrinath,"First things first. Badrinath is really a heavenly place. People, though with their typical tendencies, have created a complete town there, full of rundown houses(can't really blame the people for this-they make hay for 6 months here-selling merchadise. The rest of the time the place is covered with snow), garbage and even a gutter with filthy smell.  Found this to be the only hotel located  admist clean surroundings. True the price is steep, the hot water and central heating is not available at all times-but the staff is accomodating and friendly and electric blankets are provided.  Would I stay there again? Yes, I would. The staff does work around your problems and I certainely would not want to stay in hotels next to pounds of garbage.",gauriram,/Profile/gauriram,"New Delhi, India",40

I was amzed that to see, at this height someone has managed to provide you the luxurious facilities , so that you won't feel away from your home. If we leave the central heating of hotel , the all other facilities like hot running water, luxurious rooms with nice view, delicious food at hotel restuarant are pretty good.",ksanjay209,/Profile/ksanjay209,"New Delhi, India",40
badrinath,This Hotel has a very warm ambiance - extremely welcoming entrance for a pilgrim - very close to the main temple. This hotel provides electric blankets which is so welcome with the cold nights. only negative is the mattress was too hard so didnt get a decent night's sleep.  Restaurant is good with very well prepared food and a good variety of dishes. Staff was efficient and helpful. Definitely would stay here again,roshniSA,/Profile/roshniSA,south africa,40
badrinath,"Though this hotel has put up hoardings all over proclaiming centrally heated rooms, the reality was different.  Central heating was shut down and instead a small room heater was provided!  The best part was the heated mattresses.    The rooms were large but the space was not properly utilized.  The building from outside looks great in the photographs but did not look so great from close quarters.  The plaster was uneven.  There are other options available in the town.  One should check them out before booking at this unnecessarily expensive hotel.",kalki007,/Profile/kalki007,India,30

badrinath,"Rooms are good large and spacious but the staff lets you down. Specially the front office and the management - on the contrary the restaurant staff is excellent. This is situated at least 1.5 kms from the main temple and the hotel does not provide any facility to travel between the hotel and the temple. The one thing probably working for the hotel is that they have the most spacious rooms around. Other hotels in Badrinath have small rooms and even smaller bathrooms. Its interesting being situated at a pilgrimage place the hotel is not elderly friendly - their lifts never seems to work, and you have to get your elders to walk the 1.5 kms on a mountain. Food is good and service in the restaurant is excellent.",AmitKishore,/Profile/AmitKishore,"New Delhi, India",30
badrinath,"To be honest when I went to Badrinath, I went in with 0 expectation. I knew it was a pilgrimage town and so the hospitality sector can't be that bad. There were numerous guest houses but this seemed like the only professionally run hotel. Rooms were clean, the restaurant served decent food and the staff was polite. It is not exactly a resort but then perhaps it might be suitable to a be a bit austere in a pilgrimage town.",Jvalant,/Profile/Jvalant,Bombay,30
badrinath,"I stayed here for  two nights in 2007 as part of a pilgrimage tour with a group of western meditation students. After a few weeks in ashrams and guest houses, including some VERY basic accomodations in Uttarkashi and Gangotri (where I actually thought "" since I'm so well behaved this will be closes I ever get to sleeping in a prison cell""), this hotel was a godsend. Our group was booked into yet another stone cold ashram, and my friend and I looked at each other and said ""time for a princess upgrade"". We looked at the other  ""western style"" hotels in Badrinath, but they were WAY past their prime - moldy, damp, depressing, and not very clean.

badrinath,"I am writing this review from the hotel after taking lots of pain to go online. Hotel offered 2N 3D Temple delight package. I promptly booked. But too many shocks in store: a. Room Facilities:  1. Clean but very basic. Wardrobes suit single travellers not families. No clarity about room types . Some say deluxe is superior and some said they do not even have a thing called superior room( I booked from hotel website for a package promising superior room).No table to keep your bags otherwise too. 2. The hotel website says the rooms have Safety Vaults and Tea coffee makers. Tea coffee makers you will get after a decent fight, but you will not get safety vaults. The staff including the operator of the property(a lady), deny that their website says so. Website does. b. Rooms:",anand244,/Profile/anand244,Newdelhi,20
badrinath,"We stayed in the Family Suite ( INR 7000 for a night) during our trip to Hemkunt Sahib. The plan was to stay comfortably at Sarovar Portico and get ready for the 40 KM hill trek of Hemkund Sahib. The Hotel has some serious service problems.  Bad Things:  1. No room service: We were not served dinner in the room. After that hectic journey to Badrinath, we were asked to go to the restaurant for Dinner. After that relaxing hot water bath, imagine if someone asks you to get dressed again, walk into the freezing air to take dinner! This started the bad experience at the hotel.  2. No central heating in the room: After taking the dinner, we rushed towards the room to get cozy in the centrally heated room (as was mentioned to us while taking the room).

The Sarovar Portico is the only starred property in Badrinath. Its location could not be more approachable. The first thing you see as you enter the town is this hotel. The rooms are spacious. There are suites and if you are travelling with family, the suites provide you the comfort of privacy alongwith togetherness. The rooms provide a great view of the hill side.

badrinath,"This hotel is probably the best accomondation you can find in Badrinath, but considering the fact that it belongs to a reputed chain, I found it very basic.  Some of the good features were that the rooms are very clean with running hot water (a luxury in that part of India) and good views of the city.  The food was strictly okay.  The service too was not as efficient as it should have been.  For example, the central heating was not turned on despite the temperatures being sub zero and constant reminders, our laundry was returned to us after several reminders and the elavators were not functional.",MadhaviC,/Profile/MadhaviC,"Bengaluru, India",30

This is an all-male hotel, with no female staff, but the men are all courteous and friendly, ever eager to make the guest feel at home. The daily worship by a proper priest adds to the ambience. Within walking distance of the Badrinath temple, the location is excellent. Rooms are well-done and the bathrooms are clean & functional.

badrinath,"Under new ownership when I got there -- it's now a Sarovar hotel.	Nice place -- clean, comfortable, with a hot shower -- but they don’t supply a top sheet unless you ask for it and they may not change the comforter cover -- signs that their standard of hygiene isn't the same as mine. The first night I was in a room with no heat (the nights were cold) and with little separation from the neighbor's room. For the rest of my stay I changed to a much quieter room with heat. The food was good. They had the only internet access in  town but it was an expensive 120 Rs/hour ($3) for 24k dial up. I tried it twice -- for about 8 minutes each time, of course without paying since they told me it was never that slow -- but 24k wasn't likely to get much better and it never did get me my email.",Paul K,/Profile/go2places,California,40
