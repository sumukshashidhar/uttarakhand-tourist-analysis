badrinath,In Ghangaria you will not find a better or cleaner hotel. The in house restaurant is an add on advantage. You can ask for room service. Rooms are cosy and airy. The view from first floor is better. Staff is very helpful. Please carry cash for payments as there is no atm or internet in Ghangaria.,Prashant Kumar,/Profile/prashantkumar82,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
badrinath,"We stayed at hotel Kuber Annex for 3 nights. It was a pleasant stay. The staff is very cooperative and humble. They provide best service. Food is also good. Rates are a bit high but affordable since they provide all the services at such remote location. Geyser, fresh food, clean and service at door step.  Highly recommended.",Juhika,/Profile/Juhika_agarwal,,50
badrinath,"We had a bad experience at Kuber Annex on 21 July. The room which was given to us was on ground floor and was extremely bad - no geyser/ no hot water, no floor cover, very noisy and extremely cold. (Unlike what was promised) We expected a good rest after a long trek, but couldn't enter the room as it was extremely cold inside the room. Worst, was I did fell sick because of the cold room and could not sleep the entire night. The whole purpose of paying premium for this hotel was lost, since we expected a good rest when you get sick. Since the room was so cold, but had to stay outside. When asked the manager, we were not sh inifted to better room and were told - were occupied by other guests, in spite of doing an advance booking weeks before. Better rooms are available at Ghangria",Anish S,/Profile/100anishs,,20
badrinath,"We stayed for two nights on our visit to Valley of Flowers. The hotel staff are very helpful. Small property by regular standards but bigger compared to other hotels in Gangriya. Tea served is very sweet and milky, so tell the staff in advance  about your preference. Need to tell reception to turn on the main switch for the Geyser. Food is good. The manager was nice, helped in getting good price for the horse ride down to Pulma. I recommend this hotel.",Ramanujam Thodur,/Profile/Ramanujam_Thodur,,50
badrinath,"Delux VoF excursion   We completed this excursion in early July. Everything was organised through the hotel kuber annex itself. Our coordinator Bipin was easy to contact and quick to reply through WhatsApp.  In total our excursion was 6 days and 5 nights staying in the kuber home stay, kuber annex and hotel indra kripa. All our meals were included throughout this time.   Starting from Pulna (having stayed in the kuber home stay) the road leading to Gangria eventually turns into a stone paved trail. From here it took us about 3.5 hours to reach the kuber annex. This walk while challenging (mostly all uphill and acclimatising to the altitude) is beautiful, looking out from the trail there are mountain sides and rivers. You will mostly be shaded by the trees and there are plenty of",Kirsty S,/Profile/KCStavers,United Kingdom,50
badrinath,"We were a group of 4 and stopped at the first place as we got into base camp (which was also recommended to us), luckily for us they only had one room available so we had to look around some more, further into base camp.  Kuber annex was more than we could hope for in a small place like Ghangaria: hot water and warm blankets to get us ready for a long tough journey the next day. The place is basic and clean and staff are very helpful. Check in was quick and pain free.  They also offer massages at a cost which is always helpful before your trek- the foot massage is great! It's a few minutes away from the Gurdwara. We were only here for a night so did not try out the food. The only downside was the noise made by other guests, but that happens at most places on these sides I have",Adventurer781023,/Profile/Adventurer781023,,40
badrinath,"One must realize that reviews are “relative.” Travel experience and expectations are very individual. For me, personally, I was expecting bare bones, cold and uncomfortable. When I unlocked the door I was so grateful for the cleanliness, the thick blankets, and the hot water heater. The bucket for the bucket bath was even clean, which made me so happy. The staff was very helpful and kind. The restaurant was good. I fell ill with altitude sickness and slept through the rest of the family climbing to Hemkund Sahib. In our travels in India we stayed at some very “difficult “ places. We also stayed in five star resorts. Because of the circumstances, I give a four star rating for cleanliness and comfort in a difficult time.",mommabtoo,/Profile/mommabtoo,"Saint John, Indiana",40
badrinath,"I was all ready to face the bitter cold,  but surprisingly, this hotel provided water heaters.  And even the blankets were thick enough to keep me warm throughout the night. I also have the mention the very concerned n helpful front office manager who helped us get the right rates for our ride up to hemkunt,  after we mentioned to him how much we paid the day earlier,  not realising that we had been fleeced the day earlier. I definitely recommend this hotel. ",Naranjan K,/Profile/naranjank,"Kajang, Malaysia",50
badrinath,"Food quality very bad, instead go to nearby dhabas  Room quality not upto the mark Service very average, hot water available only for limited time, that too after lot of complains Only good thing was foot massage We understand it’s tough terrain and providing services is difficult. But attitude of people is very disappointing, they are only into money making business and don’t care for customers. Also, almost every hotel in this village is same, so there have no competition!!",Bal1der,/Profile/Bal1der,Pune,30
badrinath,"Kuber Annex is a nice place in Ghangaria. The staff is helpful but sometimes, suddenly and inexplicably non responsive. The rooms are a bit small, I was occupying one of the ground floor room 202. It all the time remains wet and hotel management should find some way out to make it dry. Toilet has full time hot water which is good part but small things like toilet door is extremely dirty and doesn't have hooks to hang towel and cloths. Food in the hotel is OK. I do understand the difficulty of maintaining things that far and out of vehicular reach but small things would make lot of improvement in overall experience. Vishal the masseur in hotel is good for a foot or leg massage after the day trek. ",Girish K,/Profile/GirishK591,,40
badrinath,"Among all the hotels its the best in ghangaria. Considering the location it has all the amenities like geyser in bath, room with blankets. Room are clean. Food was good. Service is nice. Provided packed lunch for valley of flowers. ",Pritha,/Profile/Pritha91,"Kolkata, India",50
badrinath,"Never expected much from my ghangaria stay, but this was above par. THere was hot running water, hot, homely and nutritious food on offer. The staff at this place needs special mention , they go out of the way to help you in all possible ways. The beds and sheets and clean and comfortable. All in all a great stop point to begin and end the trek to the valley of flowers and Hemkund.",shailesh p,/Profile/shaileshp830,"Mumbai, India",40
badrinath,"we stayed 3 nights at Kuber annex. very comfortable to stay. service is very good. Food quality and spread was also good. very accommodative staff. Power back up was also there. hot water was bit irregular. if they address this, they will be the best in that place. Amenities provided are very comfortable.  but for hot water, i would have given 5 stars only. very very safe too.",venkatvidya,/Profile/venkatvidya,"Madras, Oregon",40
badrinath,"It is one of the best hotel to stay in Ghangaria for some reasons, they have different types of room category (geyser & non geyser) (deluxe & super deluxe) where one can choose their best according to one's convenience. Stayed here for 4 days, everyday fast & prompt service. The hotel provides a big verandha to hangout where you can sit and relax facing the snow clad mountains.   Highlight of this place is the staff though, every single one of them is pleasant, helpful  and would go out of their way to help you. Hotel staff were able to assist us in organizing helicopter tickets and mules for Hemkund Sahib, I would say Perfect example of Uttarakhand hospitality. Stayed in August 2017, will stay again in peak season for Valley of Flowers and recommend everyone to visit this place.",manvendra b,/Profile/manvendrab10,,50
badrinath,Stayed only for a night and found the hospitality up to the mark !   Rooms were okay for such a location and food was nice    We could use their networking  to get help from the services we needed when the helicopter service did not operate .,vijay m,/Profile/vijaym1164,,40
badrinath,"In a place where providing basic amenities itself is a task, Kuber Annexee excels. Rooms are spacious in a narrow valley which nestles between 2 ranges that threaten to touch each other and are separated only by the Laxman Ganga.  Rooms are clean and well ventilated. Cleanliness is quite upto the mark. Food tastes good and service is prompt. Also the help desk gives you prompt assistance in acquiring a mule or a carrier or even booking the Helicopter service from Ghangaria to Govinghat. i disagree with the others in reviewing the hotel. One must understand this is a place which stays abandoned for 8 months a year. This is not a place where one can expect a 5-star service. The backyard however needs to be spruced up.",Jayjit G,/Profile/gangsj,"Kolkata, India",30
badrinath,"We stayed over night at this hotel. The hotel rooms are not neat. The bathrooms were not bad. The food served was very bad. They served uncooked potatoes and vegetables. There were many men employed in the hotel and in the kitchen but they did not do any good. There was no geyser. They gave one bucket of water which was also not hot as the weather there was extremely cold. The external part of the hotel was also not neat. But in this locality, there are no better places is what I understand",Dr Dhanya,/Profile/DrDhanya,,20
badrinath,"I went there with a group of friends. The rooms were very dirty, specially the toilets. Ghangaria is the base camp for your trip to valley of flowers and Hemkund Sahib. We preferred to book the hotel in advance but that was our biggest mistake. There are lot of other hotels much cheaper then this. Even this hotel offer a much lower price to walk in customers.",Jessica t,/Profile/Jessicat4753,,20
badrinath,"We had originally booked our stay at hotel Devlok in Ghangaria. The place turned out to be awful though. The room had not been cleaned and no one knew of our arrival even though the place had been booked over 2 months in advance..!  Next day we promptly switched to Kuber Annex and what a wonderful contrast it was. Clean rooms, large, clean bathrooms, clean linen and smiling service. Hot water available in a bucket chargeable at Rs. 50/- per bucket but delivered promptly and boiling hot. Mamu who was at the front desk was a bundle of energy and ever ready to help.  The food in the restaurant was the best we had in Ghangaria and this place is highly recommended for anyone planning to visit. Thanks to Rohit Nayak and Canvas N Chrome, who were managing our group tour to Valley of",archimags,/Profile/archimags,Mumbai,50
badrinath,Satisfied as it was good enough for a traveller/trekkers. Don't expect much if you are used to luxurious hotels. 24 hr electricity & water. Hot water is provided in a bucket at nominal charge. Food is okay cosidering the hilly terrain. Room service is prompt. Landline at reception helps one remain connected to the home.,shipti,/Profile/shiptis,"New Delhi, India",40
badrinath,All the hotels in this place are meant to serve a specific purpose. Pilgrims and trekkers stay here for 2-3 days on their way to valley of flowers or hemkund.  I booked this on the spot. the room was meant for 3 people but i was alone. the room was cold and dank but the folks working there were very nice and friendly. i got hot water when i wanted and a nice cup of tea. they also have a restaurant but i didnt eat there.   the room would become frigid at night and i couldnt sleep well.  please note that all hotels in this place are more or less of the same quality. they charge 50 bucks for a bucket of hot water.,saikatBangalore,/Profile/saikatBangalore,"Bengaluru, India",30
badrinath,"The best thing i liked is their location and view from the room. Beautifully located with virgin beauty and zero noise. Overall Experience: Very Good, Hotel Kuber Annex in true manner provides a Homely comfort at economical rates. Good location surrounded with trees. The hotel we stayed was best at Ghangaria but please note that at Ghangaria the hotels are very basic because they operate for only 4 months. I highly recommend this hotel and look forward to staying here again on my next trip ....",Parinay W,/Profile/ParinayW,,50
