badrinath,"The property is situated perfectly with a wonderful view, and designed such that you can't miss the view from anywhere in the house.

badrinath,"A very special place in my entire homestay list I have ever visited. Such unique and vivid interior. The moment you step inside the hall, you'd do nothing but take a 360° ""wooaahh"" view of the entire place. You'd be welcomed with delicious meals, prepared using local ingredient and method. Have multiple places to do small hikes and can be perfect basecamp for nearby treks, including Bagji Bugyal and Roopkund lake. This place always in mood to provide peaceful meditative vibes. If you do yoga, you just need to get up, go to any corner of the house, or in veranda, or on terrace, or the grass, you'd find enough reasons to stretch you muscles and do asanas.  Has definitely become my go to place in Uttarakhand.",Deepak Gulliya,/Profile/Deepakg88,,50

If u love peace n positivity then plz must visit this place ....,Karma,/Profile/Rachit6798,,50
badrinath,"The pathway leading up to the house, filled with lush bramble and a view of the rose fenced wall set the tone for my time there. The house itself was all windows which carved out picturesque views of the mountains that surround the property. With homey furnishings, plenty of books and balconies it proved to be the perfect place to disconnect and reflect.  The house manager, Pradeep made food sourced from local produce that was simple yet exceptional (anyone visiting should ask for the oyster mushrooms, parathas & pudina eggs).  The drive to the place was totally worth the 3 nights spent here and will definitely think of staying here again the next time I'm in Uttrakhand.",Rhea Thakoor,/Profile/rheathakoor,"Mumbai, India",50
badrinath,This was the second time i have been to Tridiva and I will definitely be going there again. Everybody is welcome in this house and the amount of love and positivity this house has to offer is beyond par. 10/10 would recommend everyone to visit this godly home. Props to the host for taking care of all our needs.,Yash,/Profile/yashsavs,,50
badrinath,"I stayed here for about 3 nights with my friends. If you want to genuinely get a feel of the mountains, the local life and also live in a homely environment, this is the place for you. Every amenity taken care of, a cook who can make the most delicious meals, a wonderful living room with a fire place. The house has a great collection of books, a lot of boardgames to play, a great terrace and also a fireplace out in the open. Extremely clean home, very cozy mattresses, spacious bathrooms. You can the see mountains, and the Trishul Peak from the home. The sunrise and the sunset is something you can’t miss. All in all, it is a very positive place to be in.",Deep Shah,/Profile/deepreds,,50
badrinath,"This is not a hotel, it's a home. We drove nine hours to this heavenly place. Thankfully, Meeta, the owner, was there. Lovely company, great, home-cooked food, amazing views, clean and most hospitable. Make sure than you make a prior booking through Saffron Stays. The only thing one could crib about is the lack of parking.",Karan Pandit,/Profile/karanpandit,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",50
badrinath,"We had an excellent two days stay in Tridiva , we wish we could have spent a few more days. Right from the drive from Rishikesh to the time we reached the place it was awesome views. We landed around 8:00 pm and we had our navigation on. Google told us your destination is on the right and we saw no house but a beautiful bungalow on top of the hill. The climb to place was so exciting. It was getting chill in the night and a very warm welcome and hot food was awaiting us. We had some excellent oyster mushrooms curry.  It was fresh and delicious. It has excellent views and the morning sun rise was a treat to watch from the room. Great views of Trishul and Nandadevi mountain range. It’s dream summer house to have. We had a good walk in the forest with the host some tasty homemade",Sujatha M,/Profile/SujathaM33,,50

badrinath,"I stayed at Tridiva with my daughter for 3 nights after a hectic few days of trekking in Northern Uttarkhand. The experience was out of this world.No words can describe the feeling of peace I experienced at Tridiva.The whole atmosphere inside the house,the surrounding forests with the sounds of chirping birds,the evenings spent beside the fireplace playing games of carrom and the hospitality of the host and the inhouse cook all added to the feeling of finding a piece of heaven on earth. In short,highly recommend for people who are willing to travel to a place which would change the way they think about a holiday and experience what money cant buy!",sjain662017,/Profile/sjain662017,"Mumbai, India",50
badrinath,"My travel partner LIsa and I stayed for two nights in the Gwaldam area at the Tridiva.  Pradeep, house manager and chef, took very good care of us fixing all the meals and picnics as well.  Mohan was suggested to be our guide for the full day and though we both lacked knowing the other's language we got along beautifully.  The windows were so spacious to look upon the view down the hill as well as across the valley.",paulaw825,/Profile/paulaw825,"Kansas City, Missouri",50
badrinath,"My friends and I little did we expect what we experienced. From the location, the unique access, the rooms, the linen, the toilets, the bed, the quality, the food, the host and all, was 5/5. The bungalow has been imagined, built and maintained with heart and passion. It was like home, a home that i would want to build and live in. There was nothing even remotely commercial about the place. I am quite sure that I will be back! ",arunramdas,/Profile/arunramdas,"Bengaluru, India",50
badrinath,Very recently I had a trip to Uttakhand in Dec 2017 3rd week and stayed at Tridiva Mountain Home Stay at Talwari Estate near Gwaldam in Garhwal region. I am not writing a story in detail but highlighting main points.  Location : It is approx 10 km away from Gwaldam Bus stop at Talwari Estate but it is Superb and the only accommodation as of now at or near Gwaldam from where you can see Trishul Peak of Himalaya and enjoy the immense beauty of color change at Sun Set. You can see sunrise as well but Tridiva is at the west of Trishul. So color change at Sun rise can not  be seen properly but still the view of Trishul Peak is marvelous at sun rise as well.  Home Stay:  Tridiva is 3 bedded Luxurious Home stay having Master Bedroom with attached bathroom at ground floor and other two,San_kol,/Profile/San_kol,Kolkata,50

badrinath,"When I think about Tridiva, I think about the song ""What a Wonderful World"",by Louis Armstrong. A trip to Tridiva will leave you mesmerized from the beginning to the very end. We drove up the mountains, following the river and I couldn't help but think about what a beautiful world we live in. Staying in a place like Gwaldham, and living in such isolation, it didn't make me miss having no network, and no gadgets. I looked forward to waking up in the morning and taking walks inside the forests, driving to small towns nearby, hearing all the sounds of all the colorful birds, seeing the different kinds of people all around, and especially waking up to the view of the Himalayas. It was so close I feel like I could touch it. I'm from Darjeeling, and you would think that I would be",Caroline C,/Profile/CarolineC5365,,50
badrinath,"Have been visiting Tridiva since 2010, even before the construction started. The place is so tranquil that I knew it would be a perfect place for yoga.  And I had my dream last time I visited in November 2016, with a group of friends who are yoga buffs.   Tridiva meets all expectations and more. The hostess Meeta Rao is very friendly and warm ( if you happen to be lucky she may be there when you visit) and has abundance of knowledge about the area and its people. She will advice you if you want to do a trek and arrange for a guide.  The staff is very polite and the food finger licking good. The house is so tastefully done that you feel that you have stepped into heaven. It's very well kept and managed.  Can't wait to return and thank you Meeta for a perfect retreat.

badrinath,"Our family of three stayed at Tridiva for three days from 21 st to 23 rd of May 2017.We were on a birding tour that began at Rishikesh ,followed by Chopta and next was Gwaldham. Our intent of a combination of birding,tracking and leisure was perfectly realized at Tridiva, the most comfortable homestay we've enjoyed compared to many others we've previously stayed at.             The ambiance of the house is beautiful,with lovely artifacts and soft furnishings very artistically placed.There are three rooms which are very tastefully done up ,especially the beds and the linen. The house  can accommodate 8 to 10 people easily with 2 extra beds in the master bedroom on the ground floor with two bathrooms. On the first floor there are two bedrooms with one common bathroom between them.",Harshman D,/Profile/HarshmanD,,50
badrinath,"Tridiva is heavenly. I stayed in this intricately done up homestay as my base to the Bedni-Ali Bugyal trek and it was truly inspiring and relaxing.  While the decor of the house is gorgeous, I particularly liked how the hostess herself goes out of the way to make you feel at home. Everything has been created keeping the mountain-life in mind.  Special thanks to Pradeep for preparing home-cooked meals and being so attentive. I arrived very late at night and departed equally early (before sunrise) and Pradeep was there both times.   Tridiva is a perfect getaway for all those looking to spend some fantastic time in the mountains. Whether you'd like a nature trail, a town visit, a spiritually satisfying holiday or a do-nothing time, this is a fit for all.   All rooms are great.

badrinath,"I travelled with my father and we always love visiting places that are off the beaten track where one can holiday in peace, away from the noise, chaos and dirt of the tourist places. We stayed in SaffronStays Tridiva for 3 nights, at the beginning and the end of our 5 day long trek in the Uttarakhand Himalayas.   The house makes you feel extremely comfortable while allowing you to enjoy the tranquility, the seclusion and the exquisite views of the mountains. The living room has a fireplace and a huge glass window that provides panoramic views of the Nanda Devi Range. I loved the decor including the warm colourful fabrics, geodes, artefacts and wall art, making it a beautifully welcoming place. The house is a 2-3 minute walk up the hill, which I absolutely loved.

badrinath,"A fantastic location to escape the concrete jungle. Breath-taking view of the Trishul range of mountains and a dense forest on the other side. Only positive vibes once you enter the house. The host welcomed us in the warmest way and was very kind and helpful in each and every query, serves you lip smacking food. Every room decorated in a way to help you relax. A great place for a trek nearby. 10/10 would stay at TRIDIVA again.",Yash S,/Profile/YashS747,,50
