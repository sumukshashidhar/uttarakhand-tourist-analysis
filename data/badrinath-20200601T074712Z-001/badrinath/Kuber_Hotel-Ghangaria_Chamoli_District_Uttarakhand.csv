badrinath,"Hotel Kuber, Govind Dham is the original premises just 20 meters away from Hotel Kuber Annex, a newly built one. We have stayed in Hotel Kuber  for 3 nights 2days in last July2019 for onward treking to Hemkund Saheb and VOF. Our stay was comfortable and foods were fresh. But the rooms are not well  maintained and washroom was without running hot water or  geyser. The electric switch Boards  in the rooms are open and not dressed properly causing risk for any moment.",amar_1210,/Profile/amar_1210,"Kolkata, India",40
badrinath,"Stayed in the hotel two nights on 11th and 12th August .  Ghangharia is small township mainly having hotels and restaurant for the people visiting Vally of flowers and Hemkund Sahib.  It is understood that business is for few months only and peak time is from 15th July to 15 August.  We had not much expectation on this remote location. We took 3 bed room . Very average room, hot water in buckets on payment. Service just satisfactory. Food was ok. They provide packed lunch for visit to both the location. I understand there are few better place to stay but we couldn’t get due to heavy tourists season. We had meals in this hotel, provide variety and satisfactory.  Considering services, type of room , I felt the owner can improve with little effort.  Every thing is almost double of",nalinkpande,/Profile/nalinkpande,"Almora, India",30
badrinath,"We stayed for 2 nights and it was not a great experience. After a long trek we had to climb up 2 floors to the room and there was only 1 light bulb in the entire room - explanation room is undergoing renovation - no running hot water and 2 buckets of hot water are provided - during evening due to power cuts no lights in the bathroom.  Room cleaning was very avg - the sheets are just put back and towels hung out to dry. The staff is not interested in service (overworked ?? too many steps to climb?) . Credit card not accepted  only cash , no internet /wifi ,no bills are provided for services .On the plus side the food is OK and the owner is polite - but i feel customers are taken for granted as there are few options - am told Kuber Annexe is newer and better.",Krishna J,/Profile/krishnaj_12,New Jersey,20
badrinath,I stayed in Hotel Kuber in June 2019 on my trip to Hemkund sahib. The rooms are dirty and smelling. When we asked to clean them the staff was not helpful. Over charging for most of the services. Not recommended at all. Cheating staff and owner.,Shweta,/Profile/Shweta188218,,10
badrinath,"Please note that this is a review of Hotel Kuber, NOT ‘Kuber Annex’ (which is the newer extension of this place, under the same management).  Location: Quite good. Towards the end of Ghangaria's single street. Compared to other hotels, it is closer to the entrance of the Valley of Flowers and the starting point of the Hemkund Sahib trek. It is located directly opposite Ghagaria’s gurudwara; so, if your room is one the side of the road, expect to hear hymns from the temple in the evenings around 6pm and early in the morning from 3am.  Food: Quite decent and reasonably priced. Freshly cooked, generic Indian dishes, plus bread, eggs, etc. This is the same fare you’ll get in every hotel in Ghangaria. The taste of the food was better than I expected, and we ended up eating all our",GreyVitriol,/Profile/GreyVitriol,"New Delhi, India",30
badrinath,"There are very few hotels in Ghangaria that does online advance booking. It is very basic hotel and overpriced too. But If you want to sure about your stay, you need to book anywhere. Yes, there are many low priced and better hotels in ghangaria, but one can't predict the rush in ghangaria. They will provide 2-3 buckets of hot water per room. Food are tasty, but kitchen is very dirty.",VijayTravel,/Profile/VijayTravel,ahmedabad,30
badrinath,"Unless u are traveling during peak season,never book them online. As we were charged 2850/day for the room where similar rooms/hotels were selling it for 800/day. To add to your misery u will encounter the most unprofessional and totally insane service staff. Who would make u realise that u are guilty of u request or ask them anything. Except for useless chit-chat. Also carry an extended power socket,as the only power socket u will see is in the washroom. And again Bad Service.",Jayanta G,/Profile/427jayantag,"New Delhi, India",10
badrinath,"Ghangaria, the base camp for Valley of Flowers and Hemkund Sahib. From tasty local gharwali dishes and really scenic views, you get everything you want. For the ones who just want to run away from the big city life, do consider VoF & Hemkund. we went there for 4 days and stayed in HOTEL KUBER(Ghangaria) and it was...........The Experience!  The rooms were clean, comfortable and the quilt were warm & the bathroom have all basic amenities. People just need to accept that you're not going to get the five star service in a relatively remote location with no proper road.   What impressed me the most that, the hotel staff were very helpful and gentle. I would like to mention Mr. Aman, He was always ready to guide us with an smile, because of this gentle men our tour with MOKSH VENTURE",hawny k,/Profile/hawnyk,"Bengaluru, India",50
badrinath,"I was impressed by the speed and information provided while booking this hotel. But, none of that reflects in the upkeep of the hotel. None of the rooms has any view. The door of the first room shown to me did not close properly. So I moved to the second one. Here the door worked, the quilts were too heavy to pick and looked old. I requested to exchange them and it was done. The new quilts were clean, light and warm. The bathroom and towels were clean. The sheets reasonably so. The carpet and curtains are really dirty. There are much cobwebs around the lights. There is NO plug point in the room!!! There is one in the bathroom. The staff was nice and they helped me with tips to plan my trek. Bucket of hot water was provided when asked for. The food is really nice. I was",rohinidatta,/Profile/rohinidatta,Bangalore,30
badrinath,Hi everyone... Hotel Kuber is nice hotel to stay at Ghangaria. Nice food and rooms available. Need little care for cleaniness in rooms as well as kitchen. But more than expected  facilities at a height of 3100 meter. Thanks Mr Aman Singh for his co-operation through out my journey to Uttarakhand.,madhavoza1,/Profile/madhavoza1,,30
badrinath,"When we reached Ghangaria, I assumed that this could be the right place, as it was also opposite to Gurudwara. I was happy to know that one family suite is left for our accommodation as all rooms were fully occupied in advance. A very well maintained hotel in remote area, decently priced and neatly maintained. Staff were very friendly with my family.That itself proves that I had selected a decent place. Special mention to the food we were served & thanks to the cook for very tasty food.  So it was overall very nice experience to enjoy in green at peace, understand that this hotel nowhere near the city still manages everything and a very difficult challenge successfully handled by the Hotel staff. Special thanks to Mr. Chauhan who arranged us mule and kandi to our Hemkund Sahib",Kapoor_Aman169,/Profile/Kapoor_Aman169,,50
badrinath,"Ghangaria is the pit stop for trek to Valley of Flowers and Hemkunth Sahib. Since, it is 11 km from the nearest road, the basic goods and services are more expensive than their value (you pay Rs 1,500 for a Rs 500 room). Definitely, you can forget MRP.  Since, this village caters to a large crowd (nature lovers and pilgrimage), lot of small shabby guest houses have come up. Hotel Kuber is one such guest house.  Obviously, I appreciate that providing service at such remote location (i.e. why given average rating) is a taxing task, but some basic things like maintenance and cleanliness are seriously lacking.  The rooms are dingy, damp, decrepit. The mattresses are OK there (cant say more than this) and I dont think the bed sheets are changed or cleaned frequently. Even the flushes",Divyabh B,/Profile/divyabhb,New Delhi,30

badrinath,"Duration of Stay – 14th & 15th Aug 2016  We stayed in Ghangaria for two nights while visiting Valley of Flowers. We had booked this hotel in advance since we were not sure if we will find anything there when we reach. Our expectations had been low considering it’s a very small town away from all urban facilities. However, we still managed to find this place quite disappointing.   It’s small hotel which you enter through the restaurant and then there’s a lobby with rooms on one side. Not sure if there were rooms on first floor also. We were given room on the ground floor. Room was small with a decent sized bathroom. Room contained a king size bed with very warm blankets, a sofa and a table. Bathroom had taps and showers. All of these had been as per expectation.

Services, cleanliness are always upto the mark.  it is moderately priced room rates and food are quite economical and good.Located opposite to Gurudwara, you can always have an option to visit and have Kadah Prasad.",Parinay W,/Profile/ParinayW,,50
badrinath,"Had booked this hotel(3 rooms) with my friends for two nights. Main reason behind booking this hotel was that i had stayed here previously,way back in 2011 with my family. At that time i was really impressed with this hotel. This time when i reached the hotel, it was all changed. Rooms given to us were clean. I had booked this package inclusive of breakfast and dinner. The food was good, though the staff at the restaurant are was a little less. The best part about the stay was the staff was friendly and polite and they are always ready for you with a smile.",539nalink,/Profile/539nalink,,40
