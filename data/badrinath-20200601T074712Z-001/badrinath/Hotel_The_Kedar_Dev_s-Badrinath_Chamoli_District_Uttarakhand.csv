badrinath,"Travellers -  Pls note that the hotel is almost 90-100kms away from Badrinath temple. It is a nice property, however, while booking the place, keep that in mind. And 100km drive in hilly terrain is 4-5 hours, we booked the hotel thinking it is in Badrinath, since in MMT it shows as The Kedar Dev, Badrinath and also talks about the full address. However, being unknown to the place, you will assume that this is in temple vicinity, om rarest of the occasion you will think that it's that far. It happened with us, we reached Badrinath and realised that hotel is 100km away and had to book another hotel at Badrinath and cancel/forfeit half of the booking amount.",Amit Kumar,/Profile/Amitdas7k,"Mumbai, India",30

badrinath,We had lunch at this hotel enroute to Joshimath. The food was delish with local cuisine of madua roti. The staff was very hospitable and the owner was overseeing everything himself. The owner also gave us tips on what to see in the area which was very helpful. Its ideally located on the road to Joshimath so there is no detour in making a stop. We had alerted them in advance that we would be having lunch there and they were ready with everything piping hot and rotis fresh off the tava.,PSinha2402,/Profile/PSinha2402,"Noida, India",50
badrinath,"On our way back from Badrinath to Rishikesh, we had a stop over here for breakfast at their restaurant and i was quite pleasantly surprised by the friendliness and the professionalism by the staff at their restaurant. Usually i would not remember the name of the restaurants that we ate at on the way but i was so happy by the service and the food that i made sure i remembered this place name and wanted to leave them a review.   From  the moment we entered the restaurant till we left, the guys in the restaurant treated us with utmost professionalism which i dint encounter any where in the north.  right from cleaning the table, serving us, taking orders, giving us the bill, etc etc they were so friendly, courteous and respectful. even the owner of the place was very friendly.   we",Iaintbother,/Profile/Iaintbother,"Berlin, Germany",50
badrinath,"I would have rated more than 5, but Trip advisor allows only 5. The hotel is at an excellent location, very calm and serene, 10 Kms from KarnaPrayag towards Badrinath. The team lead by Mr.Vijay Panth is excellent. Right from the time we were welcomed, it was a pleasant stay. We stayed two nights, on the way to Badri and back as well. Food was prepared as we wanted; very tasty food just like home made. Mr.Vijay was very responsive when one of us had a health issue and needed to be taken to a Doctor. He drove us in his car and promised any help; luckily it subsided. Would love to stay again if we visit this area. Badrinath is 3 and half to 4 hours from the place, and you can make a day visit to Badri and come back to the hotel if you want.",RamaKDV,/Profile/RamaKDV,"Hyderabad, India",50
badrinath,"I was returning from Badrinath, stayed here, room was simple, basic, clean. Food was hygienic and freshly cooked on order, just like home made food You can not expect more than it at this remote location Nice place to stay on way to Badrinath or return There owner Mr Pant is very humble, helping and nice person I would recommend it highly if need to stay near Chamoli or Karnprayag, I think it is midway between Chamoli and Karnprayag just on roadside",Travellar_global,/Profile/Travellar_global,"New Delhi, India",40
badrinath,This hotel was lovely. We had just arrived after sitting in a car for around 8 hours and the warm welcome we received was more than enough to dispel all our fatigue away. The rooms were pretty good but what really struck me was the quality of the service. Everything we ordered came right away and the food was very good too.   I would strongly recommend Kedar Dev's to any traveler going to Badrinath.,Salil C,/Profile/SalilC8,,40

badrinath,"Poor quality rooms, full of insects. Too much traffic noise even in night because it is right at a sharp turn. Poor quality sleep due to noise in the night and with so many bugs. Don't expect to get hot water when electricity is gone. Dirty rooms and bed sheets.  One good thing they did was that they provide me a new towel.",kunal_world,/Profile/kunal_world,"New Delhi, India",10
badrinath,"The hotel is located away from the hustle and bustle of yatra route towns. This hotel is at bhakunda (near langasu) between nandaprayag and karnaprayag.  The rooms are basic but clean. Bed, blankets and bathrooms were clean. There is a nice balcony as well from where you can watch the birds chirping in the morning and evening. Set amidst greenery, the place is certainly a good stop over en route to badrinath or auli.  The specialty certainly is the courteous staff and owners.  Parking is available for a few cars easily. Breakfast / food is tasty. Try the poha if you plan for a quick breakfast here.  Brace for a bit of vehicular noise as its on the busy NH58. Dont go expecting luxury.  Overall good value for money.

badrinath,"It's a relatively simple hotel for stay, run by a Retired Principal.   What is good about the hotel is the people who run it.  We were relatively late in reaching the hotel (after 9pm which is quite late in this region)  Sir and his wife waited till we reached (as it was pre booking) not only that once we reached first thing they did was to offer us tea and some snacks (though it was paid but the gesture itself was good)  Later the dinner was also quite good, you should not miss the bun toast with tea in the morning.  Overall a good budget hotel for an overnight stay ",NileshWade,/Profile/NileshWade,"Mumbai, India",50

badrinath,"Hotel Kedar Dev's is a nice place to stay for overnight while on the way to Badrinath and Hemkund shahib or valley of fowers.It is recommended to those who want a clean and comfortable accommodation away from the crowded towns of Rudraprayag and Karanprayag. Ideally located on the Badrinath highway and surrounded by natural beauty it has double rooms, family rooms as well as dormitories.
