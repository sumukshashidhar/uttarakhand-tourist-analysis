Me and my 2 friends reached Joshimath on Sunday night -15th December and were told by private property owners, not to travel at the location.  When we contacted the local authorities at GMVN, near the rope-way facility, they supported us and informed that the weather is open and services has resumed. The person at the rope-way not only helped us to get an accommodation at Eco Hut resort (one of the best maintained) but also recommended the sites to visit in order to make the most of our 3 days stay.

However, the standards of cleanliness and service is very average. There is a lift which is out of order. Considering that a large number of stairs have to be climbed to reach the rooms, those with knee problem better avoid. The bed sheets and towels are worn out. I found towels especially repulsive. Hence, better carry your own towels. The attitude of the staff is typical of that found in any government hotel viz. could not care less.

badrinath,Great hotel to stay at Auli. View from the hotel is amazing Service is good. Staff is very courteous.  Room rates: starts from 1400. You can also opt for dormitories which is about 230 per night and save lot of your travel budget :) . Rooms can be booked online.  Food: is ok. But at this height you only get this.  Bar: Rates at Bar is at minimum. for ex 50 ml old monk is only 70 rs.  Final Verdict: Location + affordability makes it a best place to stay in Auli.,Debrup M,/Profile/DebrupM_13,"Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India",40
badrinath,"We stayed a super deluxe room on the 2nd floor, there was a vast balcony outside the room which overlooked the snow-peaked mountains and snowy outside views.  The temperature of the night was just the touch of freezing point. Check my photographs. The hotel is located at a very scenic and peaceful location with accessibility to Joshimath via road/ ropeway. But we couldn't get chance to the ropway journey as it was closed for schedule maintenance. The hotel provided sumptuous meals on time and room service including the bar service was good.

We took a bus ride from haridwar and it took close to 9 hrs to reach Joshimath, from there we took a taxi to reach GMVNL resort which is 20 mins drive from Joshimath. It was all snowy on the roads and thats y it will take this much time. I would recommend to stay at GMVNL hotel resorts rather than staying at any other expensive hotels. Coz once you stay there then only u will understand that u cn hv good resorts at nominal prices as well. We took a room which was next to Nanda devi view room and from there the hanuman temple was also very close. That day we took a day off and next day morning we went for ski and to experience snow and snowfall. Believe me it's an",Jayant P,/Profile/JayP240209,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",50
badrinath,My husband and I went to Auli in march hoping to catch some snow and enjoy the nature up in the mountains. We stayed for 3 nights in the semi deluxe rooms and were pleased by the arrangements at GMVNL. The staff is hard working and puts genuine effort to help the guests even when it snows really hard. Our room was conveniently located near the ski lift which made it a good deal.  The food served there was good and the hygienic. We loved our room with wooden flooring and mountain views.  I recommend this place to everyone visiting Auli. The only warning is to be cautious of th wet floor and snow on the pathways.,madhulikavyas,/Profile/madhulikavyas,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",40

The service and staff have always been nothing less than excellent. it just lacked on the modern amenities. Recently i visited auli on 7th of June 2014 after a long gap and was totally surprised by the scale of upgradation that had been done at gmvnl. Again service and staff excellent !!! and now the rooms have all the comforts of cable TV, nice and clean bathrooms and rooms with views heating etc. Book in advance and this is the best option in auli comparing the cost with clifftop club.

The hotel is located at a very scenic and peaceful location with accessibility to Joshimath via road/ ropeway.

If you happen to land and rooms are available- you could try bargaining for discount. However most rooms, require walking up stairs and so if you have people who have trouble - then keep this in mind.

The Design of the rooms was so good with a sitting room, spacious Bed room and big bath room. We have taken two rooms, out of which one was very bad. The Geyser was in a bad shape and was scary (See the Picture). Good thing was that there were two heaters in each room braving the freezing cold even in mid summer. The staff were so lost in their own world and i found the manager arrogant and unfriendly.  Auli was a great place as you find Himalays just paralelly opposite to you.

When in Uttarakhand, always look for GNVM Guest Houses.  Now on to the resort.   Food quality is really good, specially the fact that they cook fresh and only on demand, they might tak 10 mins extra but the food is too good and totally worth the wait.   We had stayed in the hut and it snowed all night, It was then that we felt that the oxygen pumps in the room were not working. That was the only part of the stay that was not good.

About the Hotel: Its a Garwal Mandal property... food is ok, services and people there are nice.. rooms are not that hygienic but i think this could be the best in that region...
