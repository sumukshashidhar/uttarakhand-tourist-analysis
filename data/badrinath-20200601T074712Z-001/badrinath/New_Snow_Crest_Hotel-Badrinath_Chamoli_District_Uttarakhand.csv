badrinath,"We booked 5 rooms here. rooms were good. But there were some missing things , But rooms were missing some basic readiness like no drinking water, no towels. As we were having complementary break fast plan, all our family and friends had the breakfast around 9:30 am. Two of us went to breakfast at 10:35 am , they told kitchen is closed. I went ahead and ordered 2 plate idli on my own expense, they got the same idli's which were kept for break fast for our family and friends and charged me Rs 190. If the items are ready and we were late by 5 minutes how can they charge me extra. I think Hotel management has to think about some exceptional case and take decision accordingly.",rajanikanthachar,/Profile/rajanikanthachar,"Bengaluru, India",20
badrinath,"I visited Sri Badri Vishal from May 19 to 23. Had stayed in the hotel for one day with friends. Good place good location within short walking distance to temple. Neat rooms with heaters etc. but room rates were quite high. While Sarovar Portico charges 7500 per night for a double, this hotel charges 6850 without the infrastructure of Sarovar. But due to rush of pilgrims, surge pricing model. ",vselvarajfca,/Profile/vselvarajfca,"Coimbatore, India",40
badrinath,We enjoyed our stay at the property. It very convenient to visit main temple. This hotel is value for money. You have not much choices available in this city.

Overall we enjoyed our stay and this property and will recommend to our family and friends.,ArvindAgrawal,/Profile/ArvindAgrawal,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
badrinath,"Located just across the bus adda and at a walkable distance from the temple (5-10 mins walk only), this hotel offers super views of the nar and narayan and neelkanth peaks. The view from the balcony is stunning.  The USP is certainly the very knowledgeable and very very courteous staff and owners. In fact, the best staff and owners I have met in the recent times.  Room heater is available (sincere thanks for this).  The restaurant is excellent and offers a wide range of menu items. Enough parking space for a number of cars. Has a dorm for drivers.  Ask for corner rooms/rooms with a view.  Super hotel.",Kembhootha,/Profile/Kembhootha,Bangalore,50

badrinath,It is a nice and neat hotel but room service and restaurant service are definitely needing improvements...too slow...it is a bit of walk to the temple and coming back is up hill hence old age people may find this place a tough choice.,SivaramSi,/Profile/SivaramSi,"Bengaluru, India",40
badrinath,"I stayed at this hotel for about 2 weeks in June.  Room is bit expensive but it is worth it since there are things as room heater and geyser -- very useful when the climate is rainy or cold outside.. I know of some other hotels in Badrinath that don't have these facilities.  Otherwise services such as restaurant, room service,  laundry are costly. Check prices outside and in-house before using them.  Be careful with the laundry - mark your clothes well otherwise they lose it and won't take responsiblity for it.  Management is OK, helpful, most of the time reasonable.  Last time I went alone but next time when I go with family, I will likely stay here - definitely a good place for families to stay..",Chandramouli K,/Profile/chandramoulik522,,40
