badrinath,It is really a nice place to stay in Joshimath. Shankaracharya Temple is very near to the hotel. Location and view from the hotel are excellent. Staffs and manager are very helpful. Rooms and washrooms are neat and clean. Food quality can be improved a bit. Except that every thing is nice about this hotel. I would definitely recommend Hotel Mount View Annexy for staying in Joshimath.,priyodob k,/Profile/PK1990,"Bengaluru, India",40

badrinath,"We were there for Auli during february 2019. Perfect hotel for people looking to stay in Joshimath. Bang in the middle of city still lovely views of lofty mountains and city alike. Market is walking distance, lots of eateries, pharmacies, ATMs and Shops around. Cable car station is just 10 minute walk. Ahh for the pilgrims coming to Badrinath, manager told us the hotel is favorite among pilgrims as the Shankaracharya math (seat of Shankaracharya) is just behind the hotel and evening arti bells can be heard which soothes the atmosphere.  They even arrange a taxi for you if you ask them nicely. Friendly staff.   Side note : Auli is best ski resort in country with national and international games happening year after year. Think of cable car Gondolas going up and down on snowy",Traveler,/Profile/Traveller32100,"New Delhi, India",50
