badrinath,What an amazing heaven hidden on the top of Ukhimath hills. We were there from 25th to 28th Nov 2017. An amazing experience living in a tent house as my 4 year old son was looking forward to it since we left Delhi. Nothing one could ask more than a wide range of silver Himalayan line infront of your tent. Worth mentioning 3.5km steep Trek to Tungnath( world's highest Shiva Temple at 3650 mtr from sea level) which we completed in close to 4 hrs as our young champ was also trekked along through out on his feet. It was an amazing experience for us parents to experience this overwhelming happiness and proud. At resort hospitality was at its best even in freezing cold be it outside or inside the tent. One should visit atleast once in a lifetime to feel this internal or external,Jeetu M,/Profile/217jeetum,,50
badrinath,This is one of the best resorts in chopta. It offers the cleanest tents in the area. Washroom is very clean and the Swiss tents offer you very good comforts. They provide light throughout the evening and night for both the tent as well as the attached bathroom. Only resort to do so. They have the latest fittings in the bath and toilets.  They have solar powered lights which are very bright. Beds and linens are clean. They give extra blankets and razai and these are of the best quality. All branded stuff only. The staff are extremely hospitable. They show true care and provide very good service. Food is tasty and served piping hot. Nice to see people working with so much commitment in not so favourable weather conditions. The view from the resort are extremely beautiful. Snow,pandarinath,/Profile/pandarinath,Bangalore,50

With furnished rooms, well-facilitated rooms (including hot water), quality services, delectable food and amicable staff it welcomes every traveler with warmth. To let one cherish the experience of camping in the green Bugyals it comes handy with tents and free wood logs for Bonfire. To feel the breeze of Himalayas and swift on the curvy roads, mountain bikes are available for the guests here. Had a tranquil vacation at Himalayas Resorts.",Nilmani Parth,/Profile/NilmaniParth,,50
badrinath,"Well one of the most beautiful and clean camps that I had visited. We we're lucky enough to witness one of the most beautiful sunrise and sunsets. The campsite is  just along the main road, but is still very quiet and peaceful. The tents we're well appointed with clean bathrooms. We were a group of 18 and every odd demand of ours was met with a.smile. Good work Neeraj and Pankaj. The only downside that I could think of was lack of music with campfire. If that is done then this one of of the best campsite. Also they provided us a photographer who accompanied us for the trek. This was the icing on the cake.",Akshat_b_13,/Profile/Akshat_b_13,"Shimla, India",50

Wash area was very clean and considering the location, it was unbelievable.  We did trekking and visited local area. We also played cricket with locals. The resort had also facility for badminton and cycling. Support staff were very cordial and they cooked as per our request. They also provided one extra blanket on request, as there were heavy cold. View from the resort was majestic. If you want to visit Chopta, this is a good decision. ",sanjayr2017,/Profile/sanjayr2017,"Vadodara, India",50
badrinath,"After an exhilarating trek of the Valley of flowers we decided to spend a day enroute to Rishikesh. After consulting our local trek guides we zeroed down on Chopta. Chopta is unlike any other place I have visited so far. At an altitude of approx 2500  mt above sea level it is just a view to behold with meadows and mountains surrounding you. Also it is at the base of the beautiful Tungnath temple. We actually hit the jackpot with Himalaya resorts. A  camping lodge right in the middle of the sprawling  meadows. Hats off to Neeraj and his team for doing such a fabulous job whether it was the maintenance of the tents, FOOD, service and all.  The tents were also well lit adding to the comfort level.  A must on everyone's travel itinerary if travelling anywhere near Rishikesh. ",Shweta S,/Profile/shwetaus,"Mumbai, India",50

They also have geared cycles for guests to enjoy the beautiful valley.Since they have only 6 tents, the place is not overcrowded unlike other camps in the area. The food and service was also excellent.  Overall a decent place to stay in peace and enjoy some quality time with your loved ones. Highly recommended.",abhi d,/Profile/abhid81,,50
