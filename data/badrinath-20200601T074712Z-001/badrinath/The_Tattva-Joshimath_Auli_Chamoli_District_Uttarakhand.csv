badrinath,"The Tattva is a very beautifully setup place amid the congested mountains of Joshimath. Here are the pros 1) It has a great location, close to the Auli cable car terminal 2) It has good food given the limited options of the area 3) The room interiors are beautiful and the balcony offers a gorgeous view of the Shivaliks. 4) The staff is quite warm and friendly. Cons 1) The room we stayed in was quite cold, the heater did not suffice and we had to ask for an extra blanket the next night 2) As it's a sleepy hill town, people are not always available so if you are planning to leave early in the morning, then it is tough to get fresh breakfast or someone to carry your luggage. 3) Tattva has a lot of stairs which does not make it a great place to stay for aged people.

I did google and understand that Tattva looks a kind of decent property. I tried to connect with Hotel over call wherein I connect with Ms. Aprajita and I must say the way she helped me out in placing reservation that too beyond working hours was tremendous. I really want to acknowledge her efforts n dam professional behaviour which make me to book this property without even giving a kind of second thought . KEEP IT UP APRAJITA.

Staff were very helpful and checked on us regularly to see if there was anything else they could do for us but we just wanted to relax before our long journey to dehradun. The only thing that spoilt our stay was the renovation work going on but we understand it is off season and this type of work has to be done at some stage. They were very apologetic and it wasn't that bad. They made us a packed breakfast as we were leaving early and the sandwiches were yummy.

badrinath,This hotel misrepresent and cheat people. They have converted porta cabins in rooms. Bathrooms were seperated by cardboards and were absolutely dirty and without any ventilation.   The website of this hotel is misleading and tall claims are made which are absolutely false. The hotel is in middle of a crowded colony and one has to go on a foot through a ramp. Not at all comfortable for aged persons.   On seeing the property we cancelled the booking. We booked four rooms for a night i.e. on 6th June while returning from Badrinath. We asked for refund. At first the staff refused but later assured that booking amount will come in the bank account. Despite writing numerous mails till date no refund has been made.   One of the worst property ever seen.  ,Sameer V,/Profile/671sameerv,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",10

The property is small, has a limited seating in the restaurant and the spiritual music (Wtf) continuously played on the speakers with loud volume gets into your nerves. Like they start playing the music in the morning at 6 and it serves the wake up alarm on your relaxing holiday.  Staff needs training, they are soft spoken but not quick.  The property can be easily located on the Badrinath highway.  The owners (from delhi) were present during our stay and were warm enough.

badrinath,"A trip to Auli was always on cards, but during the hunt for a place to stay, our trip planner (a friend who is permanently designated for this job) zeroed in at the Tattva, stating the reason that Auli doesn't have much to offer in terms of staying put. Well, from the pictures posted on tripadvisor, the place looked promising.   Upon reaching the property, the owner of the place, Sudhanshu, who incidently was on a visit to Joshimath himself, came to show us around. The overall concept of Tattva is based on a German Village model and looks very cosy indeed. The rooms were exactly as depicted in the pictures.
