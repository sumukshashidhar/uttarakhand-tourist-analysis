badrinath,"We had a wonderful stay @ Devlok.  The view was awesome.  Especially the  Nilkand parvath. No words to describe the view during the sun rise and that too the snow clad mountain turning to golden colour for few seconds. Wow ... no words to describe.  The Food was excellent and the staff and the Restaurant people were very helpful. When we mentioned  that we leave early morning the next day say around 5.30am,  tea and bread toast were served and they asked us whether we need any thing more.. Very friendly and care taking staff ...  The Rooms were so comfortable and it was spacious. It was so clean. Overall it was a home away home for us...  I would love to stay there only during my next trip to Badrinath.",Uma,/Profile/UmaNatarajan15,,50
badrinath,"At the outset it is heartening at that there is accommodation available in Badrinath, a place that works (open) only for about half the year. Devok provides basic accommodation, the building though painted etc is still old, has old styled doors etc. No heaters in the room and it was really cold. The geyser in the bathroom just about worked was able to only get water out of the geyser in small trickles when we needed it and even complaints made could not get it fixed. Restaurant also offered limited choice, but welcome, when you have no choice ",Govind R,/Profile/govindrajv,,30

badrinath,"We had booked a room in Devlok for a night stay.  On reaching the place we encountered very rude staff members especially one Mr. Vinod Negi... Whose approach to everything was take it or leave it!  There is no intercom in the room and no attendant at the reception,  so in case anyone needs anything in the night... Good luck... The place is deserted from 10pm onwards!  The staff asks you to adjust with only one towel per room as they do not have enough of them!  Though the place is clean it would have helped if the staff was a bit courteous!!",Alpana71,/Profile/Alpana71,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",30

badrinath,Thank you so much everyone at Devlok. We loved our comfortable stay in clean rooms of perhaps what I can all GMVN's best tourist rest houses. Special thank you to Lakshman who helped us with our dietary preferences.   The rooms were clean. Service was very efficient and staff helpful with information or any other aid. They had placed a jar with warm drinking water in front of the reception for guests. This was a perfect touch to our overnight stay in a rather cold Badrinath.,AmritaDas,/Profile/AmritaDas,"New Delhi, India",50
badrinath,"I am a start-up, Latent Heat2Comfort Technologies Pvt. Ltd., co-founder and visited Devlok twice in last 4 months to promote our product StayWarm to provide warmth to pilgrims visiting Badrinath. In my recent stay(September 30, 2018), due to continuous rains there was no power. The staff there ensure there was no difficulty to pilgrims, provided hot water etc. In a rush to leave, I ended up leaving my laptop behind, only two realize that night after reaching GMVN SKI resort Auli. The manager at Ski Resort Auli, Manager at GMVN New Rest house at Joshimath made so many efforts to trace where the laptop was lost and finally the manager Mr. Bisht at Dev Lok called Joshimath, confirmed the presence of laptop at DEVLOK and safely sent it Devlok Joshimath with another traveler",Satya-H2C,/Profile/Satya-H2C,"Hyderabad, India",50

badrinath,I visited Badrinath on 27 August evening till 28 August noon with family including 10 year old child and senior citizen.  My experience of Hotel Devlok by GMVNL was very good and I recommend this hotel to all Yatris.  Key points; - I was allocated semi deluxe room as all deluxe rooms were occupied and I showed up on the reception at 9 pm in the evening after attending temple prayers. - Semi deluxe room was basic and simple but most importantly clean and warm with sufficient and clean bedding + towels and hot water supply. - Food at the restaurant was well prepared and presented. Taste was good. Wasn’t too oily and spicy. We took dinner and breakfast because of good quality and didn’t try any other place for food. - Location of the hotel is very convenient. I walked from temple,traasdayak,/Profile/traasdayak,"Ahmedabad, India",50
badrinath,"Badrinath Dham, one dham among 4dhams in India dedicated to Lord Vishnu is located at Uttrakhand at base of snow capped Neelkanth mountain and opposite side of Baba Kedarnath. GMVN have 2 lodges there. One is TRH the cheap one and little far from the Mandir about 1kms with no kitchen nd parking but ok to stay. It's not bad at that rate of approx 1700. Another one is Devalok with all facilities of parking, kitchen nd dinning room. Nd very close to the Mandir. Weather is little cold there. Recommended to stay there as per the budget nd which ever suits u. Fooding is no problem in Badrinath as lots of restaurants r available. One such is Ma Sardeshwari Restaurant which offers bf to dinner with lots of options from South Indian to punjabi foods. The best restaurant over there.",Amit Agarwal,/Profile/AmitA2071,"Howrah, India",40
badrinath,"My family and I had a wonderful stay at Hotel Deblok GMVN. I stayed at GMVN in Rudroproyag and called to book a room in Badrinath GMVN. At first I got a semi deluxe room which too small for the four of us. But the manager, Mr P.S. Bisht was kind enough to offer us the deluxe suite for the night stay . We were upgraded to a more spacious room which was beautifully decorated & the bathroom was clean. The interior was perfect. The staff was very polite & their hospitality left quite an impression. Food was delicious.  The location was great & only a small amount of distance away from the Badrinath Temple. It was very convenient as we had to take a very short walk to visit the temple. Overall an amazing experience. I highly recommend. Mr.P S Bisht also help ed me to book GMVN AULI",Subhasishbd,/Profile/Subhasishbd,,50
badrinath,"We have been visiting BADRINATH since the last 6 years and every year we stay at Hotel Devlok because it is best property in Badrinath with the most comfortable rooms with hot water facility 24*7, convinient parking is available  because it is big issue in Badrinath, amazing restaurant with great service, 5 minute walk to mandir and next to main market.

badrinath,"Hotel is very close to the temple. While other ‘star’ hotels were costly and away from temple, this hotel is very very conveniently located  Staff is very friendly. Good food.  Super Delux room was newly furnished. Bathroom was new & clean.  A/c was not there and neither heater. As it was second day of temple opening, I assume it will be there soon.  Wooden flooring was also new and felt good in cold weather.  I recommend booking in advance even though walk in is also possible in non peak times.",Srinivas C,/Profile/854srinivasc,,50

badrinath,"GMVN Devlok is a good property located close to the Badrinath Temple. Rooms were refurbrished when we visited and were quite good. The beds, the bathroom and the location was excellent.

Still we were taken good care of by the hosts. Overall a good place to stay.",G V Nagendra,/Profile/g_v_nagendra,"Surat, India",40

It had a western toilet, hot water was available but took a long time to heat up. The walls and windows looked in disrepair. The location was good, the view of Neelkantha from the end of the corridor was absolutely fabulous. Food was average.",Amitabha L,/Profile/amitabhal,,30
badrinath,although we did not stay at this place but saw the rooms which were of decent size - newly refurbished. the place has more than one block. quality of service is decent. food quality is good and best is that you can request the chef to make food as  per you in case one is visiting in off season.

We couldn't see the Mr. Nilkanth from our room but could enjoy the sunrise just our of the room. The temple is quite close, 5 minutes walk. It's the costlier one of the two GMVN at Badri. That one perhaps gives you a better view of Nilkanth.  Excellent for price and location and food. Still can't forget the alu-gobi, mixed vegetable and daal.

The temple is only a five-minute to eight-minute walk from the hotel. Faster walking brings one to the holy temple even earlier. It was very cold, freezing cold, especially at night. There was no room heater available. But we found the hotel staff very cooperative. My father, almost eighty years of age, was having problems coping with the freezing cold at night. He could not have a sound sleep on the first night after our arrival and was feeling unwell in the freezing cold. I told one of the staff members about my problem.
