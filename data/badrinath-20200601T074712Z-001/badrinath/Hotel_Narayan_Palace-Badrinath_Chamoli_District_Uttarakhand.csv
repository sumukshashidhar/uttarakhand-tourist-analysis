badrinath,"We were a group of 12 visiting Badrinath. This hotel is behind the bus stand - the hotel is accessible via a mud road. The hotel is about 10 mins walk away from the Badrinath shrine. Good views of the Bar and Narayan mountains. We were lucky to see a gorgeous sun shine from our Hotel window. The hotel is accessible via a staircase only; I saw some some senior citizens struggling to climb up the steps. No wi-fi available. Rooms TVs also were not functional. Bathrooms are very tiny and poorly ventilated. The rooms are comfortable but no Acs or fans - which was a bit strange , not that one needs an AC in Badrinath. But a fan would be helpful to keep the air circulation going. It is a very basic hotel which serves the purpose of proving you with a fairly comfortable place to stay,",ToffeeTour,/Profile/ToffeeTour,"Bengaluru, India",30

Food is so bad that even Maggi veg noodles was not eatable.Breakfast buffet remains the same every day with very limited options & that too tasteless & cold.

The food quality is acceptable & guys are friendly. However, the manager need to improve his interaction with customers.(He just keeps staring at everyone sitting in the reception area as if he's one of the customer himself).
