badrinath,Hotel AR resort is located at main road.  Best for person who are traveling to bedhrinath . Rooms are well maintained and are normal in size. All basic facilities are available in the room. Food is only the problem for those who donâ€™t have habit of eating North Indian food.,Kawaljeet Singh,/Profile/kawaljeet_uppal,"Indore, India",40

badrinath,"This hotel is few KM's before rudraprayag on your way to Badrinath. As you will be travelling all day and you will have to continue early morning, this is a small simple budget hotel on the way, nothing fancy and a safe place with great staff who will try to help you at their best. The rooms were not as clean earlier, but taken care of when asked. The service was amazing and the food was delicious.",Utkarsh T,/Profile/899utkarsht,"Mumbai, India",30
badrinath,"Pathetic room condition, room not prepared at 8 pm at night despite talking to someone at 6 pm and providing arrival time. Trash can were not cleaned. The only reason for picking this was unavailability of any other hotel online. Stay away .. I would say!",capsislock,/Profile/capsislock,"Phoenix, Arizona",10

badrinath,"I reserved two rooms at AR Resort, after being led to believe that it was in Badrinath.  In fact, it is literally 100km away from Badrinath, which is about 4 hours of driving time, in the mountainous terrain.  Do NOT book here if you are planning to stay near the Badrinath temple!  We were forced to scramble and find alternate accommodations after driving all the way to Badrinath and not finding this hotel anywhere.  We heard of four to five other families who met the same fate as us.  We were lucky to find another hotel.  Another family of five - with three kids - ended up having to sleep in their van overnight after being unable to find any other rooms available.",SudhirA166,/Profile/SudhirA166,"Cary, North Carolina",10
badrinath,"the AR Resort is basically is  a very good hotel staff, food and all the services are not to be rated as aResort or Hotel  should be rated as a best home this is my opinion very neat and clean, perimises even if IU want a tea,water any thing at night is the at door bell, I can not forget the food, only if this Resort would have not been far I wish the Sri Badrinath gives the an idea  to hotels those they are near to them to do the same beheviour with the customers those they staying with them",delhineeraj786,/Profile/delhineeraj786,delhi,40
badrinath,"We stayed in this hotel on 2nd June,13. To start with, the photo published of this hotel is not correct.  This photo is of a resort in kausani. The AR resorts is not in badrinath, not even n gauchar but nagrasu. There are only few rooms, structure is n shambles and construction stalled for last 5 years. The approach road is not there, neither there is pavement, nor there is restaurant , lobby is totally broken with roof covered with tent cloth. All travel websites should immoderately blacklist this hotel as the room is not worth rs800 and we were charged Rs 2800. The good hotels are sarovar portico in badrinath and monal resorts in rudraprayag ( half way to badrinath fro haridwar). Action should be taken against the owner for wrong info and they be blacklisted.",KaruneshMohan,/Profile/KaruneshMohan,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",10
badrinath,I booked the hotel knowing that it is in Badrinath ji but this is far from Badrinath ji Temple. It is better that on line search engines dont show it in Badrinath Temple area as generally people book hotel rooms thinking that they will be staying nearby the temple. OR distance from the temple has to be highlighted so that customer is not misguided. I had terrible time in arranging for another hotel and getting this cancelled though it had costs both ways.,shishirkapoor,/Profile/shishirkapoor,"Lucknow, India",30
badrinath,"it is a great place to stay room service. food and cleaning are really high class, staff is well managed restaurent they have is again  very neat and clean, staff takes very good care  only problem I felt is far from the temple I suggest people if they stay here they shoud start for temple very wearly in the morning  so that they want to come to stay here again can come back to hotel by afternoon or late evening,rest is an excellent place",ashok1532344,/Profile/ashok1532344,"Navi Mumbai, India",50
