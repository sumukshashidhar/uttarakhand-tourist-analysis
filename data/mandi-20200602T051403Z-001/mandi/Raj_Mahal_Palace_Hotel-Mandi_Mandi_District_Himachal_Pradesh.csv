But I left it after one-night of stay and at the reception they didn't even bother to ask why I am leaving after having made a booking for 7 days, all they cared was it was all paid.

The older rooms whilst quaint require modernization and better upkeep. Many of the more recently added rooms are still being finished, so the smell of paint on that side of the building is overwhelming. The staff in general are not the politest or most attentive, however a brief view of the food preparation area showed that it was clean, tidy and perhaps the best run part of the operation.

The bedsheets were covered with body hair, so we asked them to change them. However, after they supposedly took care of that, the hair was still there.

The staff treats guests exceptionally well and considering some of the other alternative properties, represents great value for the money! Be sure to meet Ashok, who will entertain you with mind twisters (you cn't beat him on his own turf) and tell stories of days gone by.

The restaurant is nice and serves great food. Although the service could use a little bit of a touch up. I recommend this place to stay.",vgs14,/Profile/vgs14,"Mumbai, India",40

mandi,"This place is dependent on what you're looking for.  It's a throwback palace to the days of the Raj in India.  It used to be the palace for the ruler's family (I believe the elderly son of the ruler manages the front desk).  The garden area is quiet and gorgeous.  Like all the pre-AC era rooms in old Indian palaces, the rooms are woody and a bit dark (but have cable and a fantastic A/C system now).  The location is right smack dab in the middle of downtown Manali, and within walking distance to the cool garden area with a huge pink temple on the street level.  Also many of the other temples in Manali are within walking distance. It's best to venture out from the hotel at sunrise to see the city in all its morning glory (no crowds, no pollution).

mandi,Stayed for one night but the place was far below expectation. The management was non existent . The service staff looked least bothered. They still seem to be living in the old era which cares two hoots for the commoners. The beds were cringy and the upkeep was not upto the mark . Why such heritage properties are being wasted. The saddest part was the way they have added new concrete blocks to the property. The food was the only saving grace. Edible.,Aman S,/Profile/bobby11kullu,"Shimla District, India",20
mandi,"stayed here in September 2013- mandi being a small but bustling town didn't offer a whole lot of accommodation choices near the main bus station- rough guide said this was ramshackle but decent. we were given a fairly nice, old fashioned room, had a lovely meal and some drinks in the v colonial setting of garden bar- however at night a rat made its way onto the bed!!the other room we were given also had a rat in it...not exactly what you want in a hotel! beware- they only come out once the lights are off!!!",cailingaelach3,/Profile/cailingaelach3,"Donegal Town, Ireland",20
mandi,"We stopped here for a night while on a Himalayan Royal Enfield tour. A wonderful old place, like stepping back 60 to a 100yrs in time. Slightly faded but full of character with good old fashion service. beautiful gardens in witch to dine and drink. We also was joined by the Maharaja who entertained us with anedotes and puzzles etc.  Well located in the center of town. Rooms basic but clean. Food good. Was originally part of the palace so worth wandering around the restaurant bar and upstairs to the gallery. Lots of old photos of the days long gone by.",tigergent,/Profile/tigergent,"Northampton, United Kingdom",40

The hotel has beautiful lawn which hosts the open air restraunt also. The food served here is really tasty. One should try ""Pindi Chana"" for sure here.

The breakfast was fantastic - talk about their stuffed paranthas, pancakes and their chole bature. We didn't have the opportunity to stay there so these four stars talk all about their food..... nothing else.

mandi,"The good things about this hotel: it's location in the centre of town, the lovely gardens. We also lucky enough to be on a group tour and our tour leader knew the Maharaja himself; a sprightly 80 something with a wicked sense of humour who joined us for lunch, dinner & breakfast. The food was fine but nothing out standing. The not so good things about this hotel; don't think you will be staying in a super luxury, heritage-style property. My room was very shabby and the bed sagged. Hot water was intermittent. The dinning room was vast and soulless. I'm also not convinced that, if hadn't been with the Maharaja, the service would have been anything to write home about.",Pat S,/Profile/travel_addictReading,"Reading, United Kingdom",30
mandi,The hotel is located in the center of the town and is surrounded by all sorts of dwellings.These dwellings it seems have come up over a period of time and cover the hotel boundry from all sides. Hotel is spacious with large rooms but with hardly any windows which was a drawback as we were not able enjoy any views.Restaurant was really good and quite spacious.Bar was well stocked and the staff very courtieus.This hotel is meant for business travellers looking for a centralised hotel with comfort and good food.Overall a decent experience.,sachinaarav,/Profile/sachinaarav,Delhi,40
mandi,I stayed here with an Intrepid tour and had a wonderful room however the rooms were variable and I probably had one of the best. The room was clean and bright and the bathroom was clean with plenty of hot water. My bed was on the firm side but I slept well. The only downside was no WiFi which we had become used to even in the most basic hotels. Good location for walking down to the river and the temples and also for getting to the Indira Market and sunken garden. The food was good and service was quick. It was one of our party member's birthday on the day we were there and we ate a lovely meal in the garden. The owner's father is a very interesting man who loves to have a chat. He also likes a joke and caught many of us out with his funny jokes.,ALH57,/Profile/ALH57,"Sutton Coldfield, United Kingdom",30
mandi,The hotel is nicely located right around the city center. It has a nice heritage feel to it. The room area has a nice heritage feel and the rooms are comfortable. Though not all rooms have windows but largely for someone who is looking for a good place to sleep at a very decent price then this is the place. The food is excellent and the open air seating adds to the experience. The service is quick and very responsive. we had stayed for one night on our way to Manali and honestly we found it extreme value for money.,nikhil25,/Profile/nikhil25,"Mumbai, India",30
mandi,"we had high expectations given the heritage of this hotel but were totally underwhelmed. The standard 'deluxe' room that we were initially given didn't have a door or window that could be shut properly & was incredibly noisy. We upgraded to an internal room which was a lot better, the bedroom was cosy & the communal lounge area outside pleasant but the bathroom was showing its age & no-one in their right mind would've sat in the decrepit & peeling bath. I agree with the previous review that the staff are tired & jaded. We ate here in the evening & for breakfast, both meals unmemorable.
