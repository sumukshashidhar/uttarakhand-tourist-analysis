It has all pros like: Mesmerizing balcony mountain view Great wooden room interiors and amenities Jaguar fitted washrooms with hot water Good Breakfast and Dinner Outstanding room service and hospitality  There is only one problem that it's 4 km far from main road or mall road, one would need to pay 200 to 300 per side to commute between main market to hotel. So keep 500 aside per day for commute along with hotel charges.  I stayed with family for 2 days and found worth the fares worth.

Because it is secluded and on a steep slope, forget venturing out for an after dinner walk or sightseeing.  You need to have  a vehicle at your disposal. 2)  Although staff is friendly, the hotel could do with a strong management team guiding the rest of staff.

Location : About 3 kms from Noisy Mall road, it is on a beautiful location at Kanyal road. There is a lot of peace around and from the balconies you get an awesome view of whole valley. Even if you don't plan to do anything, you can sit in the balcony or go to the valley facing garden area and you can spend hours. So location wise 10/10. Hotel arranges cab service for you to visit places.  Service : World class!!. Staff was always polite, always helpful & quick, and always smiling. Would like to mention names of Mr Nokhraj, Mr Rana who were leading this effort of managing staff. Staff score 9.5/10 (9.5 because no one is perfect but can reach near perfection).  Food : 10/10.

There is no central water heating system so you depend on individual geyser for the room. The washroom plumbings are not good and I had to struggle to get the optimum hot water for bath.   The hotel doesn't have central a/c or heating system which was a big surprise. To cools off at nights you have to open the windows and let the moistureless air come in. You need to adjust that in the mornings to stop getting chilled. If you are in during the day it can get hot inside the room and they only have a pedestial fan. Is this a 3 star hotel ?

If you have your own vehicle then the distance should not be much of an issue, except that it would take you 10-15 mins from the market area to get there.  It is located at a good altitude and that gives some good views of the valley and nearby hills from the room balconies.

We had to pay extra 200 per night for heater after paying nearly 6000 per night for the room 4. Wifi quality was very bad One more thing one need to be aware of is that this hotel is located on a hill top about 4 kms from Manali main road. Also the road is not good and very small. During winter when there is heavy snowfall this road can get blocked for a day or two.

Overall the staff if helpful and the hotel is absolutely worth staying if you are conscious about hygiene. The only factor that goes against the hotel is the accessibility. It is a good 20 mins hike from the main road. From the mall it is about 30-40 mins talk, so its not doable everyday.

Also the food service was a bit slow and the food missed the mark sometimes, only sometimes though.   I have given 4 stars for the value it provided via the location and view.

It is 3-4km away from the main mall road which is a good thing because we come to such peacuful hill stations to find calmness and you can see a 180 degree view just from the balcony of your room with snow capped mountains.  The tagline of the hotel is hospitality at its best and the service completely does justice to the tagline. The waiters were very cooperative and on time. The receptionist, Ms. Niranjana Kapoor talks very sweetly. Another manager, Mr. Rana was very helpful in providing us with prompt taxi services - although that was not a part of the package. The Managing Director, Mr. M.C.Thakur himself helped us to tackle with one of our problems. This completely tells about the hospitable",Sataksh,/Profile/Sataksh,,50

The last time i came to manali, i stayed in their cottages- it was the best trip of the hills,we could have ever had. This time my experience was same.

It is located just 3-4 kms from Main manali circuit road.The staff is so hospitable. Every time at your beck and call. We stayed in the luxury rooms with a garden right outside our doors.

All the services provided by the hotel are magnificent especially the hotel architecture, its fabulous interiors, magnificent view of valley and rohtang pass, cleanliness, prompt service, wi fi, helping nature of staff, away from city traffic etc. One can easily hear the honeydew musical sound of flowing vyas river which is soothing and calming and refresh your mind. If we talk about the food the best way to define its quality is a ""home outside a home"". I don't think so that in manali you can ever get as good quality food served in holiday heights.

mandi,We had an opportunity to stay in this hotel for 3 nights (22nd May to 25th May). The property is newly constructed one which is located on top of most of the hotels and resorts. No traffic conjunction or pollution could bother you at any point in time. You could get a 360 degree panoramic view to the snowy mountains by sitting from your room couch. The hotel staffs are highly professional and are ready to extend their support at any given point in time.  The most admirable and interesting thing is the fluency in English which they speak. We were around 9 of them and none of them could speak hindi and we had a very difficult time to converse with our driver. The staffs were very supportive in translating our thoughts to the driver and making him to understand. Extending support,muthu70,/Profile/muthu70,"Chennai, India",50
mandi,"After a set of trekking expeditions reached the quite and beautiful town of manali, the idea was to find a place which could show the essence of the place. Holiday Heights was an ideal location, situated 2.5 kms from Mall road, providing a magnificent view of the entire valley and the snow capped mountains.  Be prepared for a long walk (as there was a taxi strike), but it is a good exercise. The place is closer to old manali where you will find lots of adventure activities, some nice food courts and an old place charm. Find a place near the river and you can spend some nice quiet time with oneself or friends.  Choose either the suite or room in line of 104,105 and upwards.
