mandi,"We enjoyed staying in both the properties at Tatva Bir, the Resort and the Tent. Best part is the hospitality provided by the Management along with the staff, the feeling is at home like, we enjoyed the food the most, homemade. Cleanliness is at its best. It was fun tracking to nearby lush green forest & places. Its like you are in the lap of Mother Nature.  Morning time we could hear & see lot of birds chirping, soothing our ears & eyes. Last but not the least, these properties are near the International Paragliding site, hardly 15 km away. We also enjoyed the Snowfall. It‚Äôs really value for Money. Thanks Tatva Bir for such a awesome holidays. Keep up the good work. God Bless üôè",PRASAD NAIR,/Profile/Pkottur,,50
mandi,"This review is based on couple of stays in Tatva Resorts and Tatva Camps as well. My second stay at Resorts was an indication of how good my first stay was in Tents.  1. They have a team of highly flexible people. You feel like you are staying at home amongst your people.  2. Food quality and taste is awesome with fresh ingredients.  3. Camps and Resorts are away from hustle bustle of the market yet easily reachable, you can spend quality time sitting in the garden, enjoying in pool and doing outdoor games like Cricket, Badminton etc.  4. Both the sites are well maintained, clean and hygienic.   5. Aruna ji along with her team members Balwant ji and Surender ji are quite helping in nature. They are eager to serve you the best that can.  My review rating: 5/5  -Himanshu",Himanshu Dwivedi,/Profile/himanshuDwivedi,,50

Rooms are very spacious and maintained very well. Food was awesome and the service was excellent. I strongly recommend to experience the tents too. Over all our experience in tatva BIR resorts was excellent . We wish the management and the staff of this hotel all the best. Keep up the excellent service.

mandi,I visited with my family and friends in June 2015. We came pissed off from a hotel from palampur but when we came here we liked it immediately.   We stayed in violet to green tents and enjoyed the hospitality thoroughly.  All 4 ppl who served us were good natured and never said no to us even though sometime we had to wake them up because of our little kids. Food/snacks was good and homemade chapatis were a bonus. Especially the tea was very tasty. We sat in lawn area throughout evening till mid night and enjoyed the serenity of mountains and a rivulet nearby and a clear sight of paragliders flying from jumping point Tents/linen were neat and clean and so were bathrooms. Of course insects were a problem as violet and indigo tents had lost its seal on one of its wall but i guess,navneet666,/Profile/navneet666,"Hoshiarpur, India",40

She asked for our lunch and before we reached everything was arranged and prepared. Tents are good, nice and clean with beutiful ambience.No disturbance. The only drawback is that in afternoon the tent gets very hot, but since outside weather is pleasnt you can always lie down in garden, but if air conditioning is done would be nice for afternoons. Morning and evenings are cold, kids needed yo wear sweaters.Bathrooms were clean and wrll kept. The staff was very nice and totally dedicated.

In hindsight, it was a very well taken decision. Tatva Bir has Rooms as well as Luxury tents, the latter being better were given to the ladies. The management hasn't cut corners anywhere, their accommodation is spacious in all aspects including toilets, everything is very clean. We had no complaints with their service, we were very well taken care of. Meals were lavish and very nice, if not mouth watering and we were served a variety of items during B'fast and Dinner, the two meals we had with them.

The owners and staff are extremely helpful and courteous, they made us feel like home. The food is simple, homely and good.   Bir is place not known so such, so its not crowded and you are away from hustle bustle of a tourist destination. The resort is surrounded by mountains. Must do paragliding, it's the second best place for paragliding in the World. Its also great to do mountain walk, fishing, rock climbing, river crossing etc. The resort knows local people who organises all the recreation and adventure. We will certainly go back again in few years. Cheers",PraveenMoon,/Profile/PraveenMoon,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
