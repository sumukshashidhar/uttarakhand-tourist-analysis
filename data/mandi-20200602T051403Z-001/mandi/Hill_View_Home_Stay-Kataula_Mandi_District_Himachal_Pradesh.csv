mandi,"We stayed 2 nights. Mr Verma is a very nice man. We felt very relaxed staying there, very peaceful. We ate our meals at the homestay only, and they were DELICIOUS. Especially loved Mandiali curry. Service was great! Would recommend to anyone passing through Kataula on their way to Parashar.",Danielle E,/Profile/DanielleE1201,,50
