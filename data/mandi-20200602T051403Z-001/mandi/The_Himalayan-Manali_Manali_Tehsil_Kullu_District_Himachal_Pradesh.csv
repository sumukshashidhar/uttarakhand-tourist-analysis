With so many destinations to discover, The Himalayan is one of those few properties one would wish to come back to. My experience was excellent right from the moment we checked in, till the time we departed. The location is outstanding and rooms offer spectacular mountain views. The property has lovely nooks and corners in its rambling Victorian orchard and garden. My cottage was well appointed and there is a garden gate opening onto adjoining orchards from where one can take an uphill trail, culminating in a lovely half day hike.

The Himalayan has cottages and Chambers which you can stay in, a pool to rejunevate, a board room for all those business meetings and an amazing restaurant and dungeon - their Church styled bar. On top of it is the view of the mighty Himalyas which I'm sure you can never have enough of.  The service is quick and the staff is super polite.

On getting there we loved the place the hotel staff is also very good and as it was raining and they had given is rooms on the third floor with terrace the water and kids did not go well they upgraded us to the cottage. We had a lovely time in the cottage as kids had their space and a fireplace was there in which we got the fire every night. We had breakfast on the pool side which was a superb setting for breakfast next to the mountain. The food at the hotel was also good but there are better options available outside.,ankur c,/Profile/667ankurc,,50

The 'castle' like architecture also lends to the overall experience - ""it feels like we're staying at Hogwarts"" is the way my wife had put it.   The staff and management are very hospitable and courteous and took really good care of us throughout our 4 night stay. The food is probably the best you'll find in Manali.

Despite taking a break of journey at Chandigarh we found ourselves frustratingly well short of Manali a good two hours away even at 9 PM. Hence I called the Hotel to enquire the dinner timings. I was told that the last order is taken at 10.30 PM but the person at the other end of the line was kind enough to offer that in case I could order on the phone before this time they will keep a hot,SanjaySharma_69,/Profile/SanjaySharma_69,"Noida, India",40

The architecture is fabulous, the rooms well appointed, food is good, owners are very friendly - watch out for the younger brother though, don't let him play you at Scrabble - he doesn't believe in the old adage 'the guest should always win'.  In all, we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly, stayed off the beaten paths, blazed some trails of our own. The owners go out of their way to help customise your holiday and tell you fabulous stories about the local folklore. The hospitality was so good that we ended up extending our stay a couple of days - Thank you Bobby, Nishat, Tulsi, Mimi & the Himalayan, hope to see you again!

However, the best thing about the place is the owners. They live on the premises and are extremely warm and helpful.

After a long exhausting 14-hours car journey from delhi,being very choosy we didn't settle for a couple of hotels we viewed,and thank god we stumbled upon this beauty.The owner himself personally showed us the cottage and we instantly knew this was where we would be staying in Manali.The cottage was charming,there was a sense of serenity and comfort. Every detail of the cottage was perfectly done,attention was given to every interior,from the photographs hanging on the walls to the open concept of the bathtub.The bedroom was spacious and well-decorated.In fact,the cottage was incredibly clean.In addition we had a fireplace,which added a much more homely feel to the",Narin_Padalecki,/Profile/Narin_Padalecki,"Rome, Italy",50
mandi,"Five of us (me, wife, kid, two domestic helps) stayed at The Himalayan for four days during Dussehra. The cottages -- which come with fully loaded kitchens -- are great and perfect for someone travelling with children/elderly. Far from the bustle of the mall, the resort   Everything in the entire castle -- from the doorknob to the furniture -- seem to have been handpicked with a lot of thought. Even the kid had a blast on the trampoline with the furry one hanging around!   Though the restaurant/bar were yet to be opened, the old world feel -- and the fireplace -- more than make up for them. The warmth of the owners (who also manage the place personally). The rooms in the castle were not fully ready, but four-poster beds and open-air hot baths are luxuries that few places in",Driftwoood,/Profile/Driftwoood,"Kurseong, India",50

The cottages are just as comfortable as your own home would be,very well thought of designs and executions too! The best part was that my kids were pretty occupied with stuff to do on the property itself! The environment was safe and peaceful.The concept of the cottage suits the typical Indian family setup! A good job done!",Navjyot,/Profile/Navjyot,Panchkula,50
mandi,"We stayed at the Himalayan two nights longer than planned on our July 2011 trip to Leh. The stay was the highlight of our trip. Everything else that could go wrong, did.   To begin with our flight from Delhi to Manali was cancelled, and we ended up driving - a process that took almost 15 hours. The Himalayan took that in their stride and when we arrived at midnight their staff were waiting, our well appointed room was immaculately made up, and very comfortable. Since we arrived so late at night we decided to begin the journey to Leh one day later than our original plan and spent the next day hanging out at the Himalayan. Ate a really gargantuan breakfast, got to know the owners and just chilled.  Next day we set out early and spent 12 hours trying to get over the Rohtang pass",IttyVarugis,/Profile/IttyVarugis,"Bangkok, Thailand",50

The cottages and rooms are tastefully done up and the food and service is good. The restaurant and bar were yet to open when we travelled and we do hope they are in the same league as the rest of the resort! Great place to go with kids and family.",ajayoak,/Profile/ajayoak,"New Delhi (Delhi), India",50

Our three children had so much fun between the trampoline, the pool, the tennis table and etc. That we had hard time dragging them out of the resort to see manali, which is few minutes walk from the resort. The place has recently opened by a very nice local family which will do whatever is needed to make your stay pleasent. We had wonderful week in the resort and will be happy to come again .

Apple orchards, snow-capped mountains and clouds floating in. A great getaway to spend your holiday. And to top it all, is the warmth, and the personal touch of the owners.

We decided to check out early from the hotel we were originally booked in. Both of us work for an architectural firm and to stay in a resort with such lovely surroundings combined with brilliant gothic architecture was a real treat.   The cottages laid out in gardens abundant with Daffodils and orchards in full bloom added to the whole experience. Our cottage provided us magnificent views of the freshly snowed mountains. The cottage interiors are plush  with working fireplaces (a rare luxury these days) and victorian bathtubs. We both love to cook and found the kitchenette especially useful with children.

I got there without having to ask for directions, as it is very conveniently located close to the city center. Once there, it seemed so far away from the madding crowd.

I opted for the resort as it looked very nice on the internet as most of the hotels do, but the moment i checked in i got much more than what i expected. Starting with the warm welcome, the hotel staff was very co-operative and friendly and they took all my needs as there responsibilities and it felt like being at home.In short if you are planning to visit Manali do go for Himalyan resort.
