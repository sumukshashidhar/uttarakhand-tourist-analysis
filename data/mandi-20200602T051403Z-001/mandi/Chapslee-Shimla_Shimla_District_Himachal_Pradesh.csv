About that first impression of walking into a country house. About the feeling that I seen it before (eventually I discovered it had been on a program on the National Geographic channel I'd seen). About the gorgeous tea and drop scones we were given on arrival. About the guided tour of the house. About feeling terribly diffident about staying in a place with two hundred year old wall paper and a curtain from the Doge's Palace in Venice, but how the staff soon put that feeling to rest by their brilliant service.

Pre-dinner drinks were served on a tray in the room: gin and tonic with thin fresh lime slices, vodka and guava juice; crisps and chick peas. The spirits were served in cut glass silver topped jugs.
