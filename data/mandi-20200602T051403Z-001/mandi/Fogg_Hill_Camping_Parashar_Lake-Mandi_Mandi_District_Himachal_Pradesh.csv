mandi,"Parashar lake itself is very beautiful but the trail to this lake has added cherry on top. The trail was equally challenging while climbing up and getting down. It couldn't have been this fun and safe at the same time if we did not have support of our trip organizer Raj and guide Pawan. They did every bit to make us feel like home. Thank you for your hospitality, waiting to see you soon in summers.",Ruchi Singh Bhadauriya,/Profile/Nomadic_old_soul,,50
mandi,"Preferably, I go solo but this time I came across this camping site running by Mr Raj while reading about the trek over inetrnet. And this came out of the best. Raj bhai & his team was standing there in every thick and thin. They behaved more like a friend than a travelling agent. The guide Pawan helped every single person if required on the trek. Camp was organised in way that we enjoyed our time till 1 A.M. with bonefire. Best people. Raj effort was applaudable and I wish him best for his future endeavors.",Hemant Rathore,/Profile/nomadikengineer,,50

mandi,"Fogg hill camping Raj bhai is best, he made our experience very good. He provided 5 times food when only 3 time was mentioned in package. They take us like family, some people were not able to climb because of improper shoes they took them and helped them personally.I even lost my wallet which he sent me through courier back. I will come back to this place just because of rajj bhai.",shubham05101995,/Profile/shubham05101995,"Jodhpur, India",50
