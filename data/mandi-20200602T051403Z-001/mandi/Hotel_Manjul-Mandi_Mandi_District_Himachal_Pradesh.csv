mandi,"Lets be honest with you if youâ€™re in a budget you can stay here without a doubt, decoration wise it is 3/5, food wise it is 3/5, serving wise 2/5, staff lacks good communication skills but overall good experience ",705onams,/Profile/705onams,,30
mandi,"We went here in mid May. The service was terrible, because they were clearly understaffed for the number of rooms they have.   The rooms are decent. They keep the building's outer lights on throughout the night, so ask for a room that does not face the road.  The restaurant is what I liked best, as they make great food, almost home-like! Do try the mughlai chicken.",Akshat A,/Profile/111akshata,,30

mandi,"Was driving up from Delhi to Manali as usual. Left Delhi at 4:25pm and reached here at 12:15am at midnight. Solo drive.  Hotel was booked on the fly via Goibibo. Its bang on the highway, on your left, as you cross Mandi. Next to Shingar hotel. Looks small from outside but is quite a big property with new rooms at the back (hence cleaner too) My review is purely based on the fact that they were up n waiting for me even at midnight. Super quick check in, big room, decently clean, geyser worked, bed was just right in terms of hardness. And VFM for the price I paid via GoIbibo. Parking has to be done on the main highway but I was lucky enuf to get one bang in front of hotel gate.  PS: if u r driving at night, the area around Sundernagar/Ner Chownk gets fogged up very badly.
