mandi,"If you are budget traveler, just get down near the first bridge in Barot, cross the bridge, walk for half a km to the right amidst nature to finally reach this beautiful river side homestay. Infact in whole Barot, there are only two good and cheap homestays with beautiful riverside sitting area and views. Rooms are good and clean with homely food. They might only provide breakfast in non season. This side of the bridge is comparatively quieter and serene. Host is a nice person who is always ready to serve you. Come with family or friends. Highly recommended.",HOMPRS,/Profile/HOMPRS,"New Delhi, India",40
