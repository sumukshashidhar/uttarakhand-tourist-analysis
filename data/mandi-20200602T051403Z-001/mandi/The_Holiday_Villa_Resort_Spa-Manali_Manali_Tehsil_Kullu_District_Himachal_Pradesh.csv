mandi,"Guys if you are confused about which location you should choose to stay or amenities or food at Manali, then I must assure this could be the end of your search. I stayed at this hotel for 5 days.   1) The hotel is situated at the top of the hill. I must say, the view is super awesome. You will never regret about the views.   2) Breakfast and dinner were both included in my package. The food was very delicious and quality was best. They offer a wide variety of items(north Indian, south Indian,juices, bread, egg etc.) in both breakfast and dinner (both buffet). I still remember the taste of ""Sevaiya kheer"". You will never have to move out for food.  3) The rooms are very spacious and luxurious from every corner. The ambience and wooden work gives it a 5 star look.
