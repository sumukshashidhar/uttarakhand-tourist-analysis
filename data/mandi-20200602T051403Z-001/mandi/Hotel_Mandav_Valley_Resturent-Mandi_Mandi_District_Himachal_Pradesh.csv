mandi,"The hotel inspite of being a government run hotel is very neat and clean. The reception staff are very friendly and help you out with lots of places nearby to view. Good housekeeping. Food very basic. Overall if you want to break your journay to and fro Manali/Kullu and enjoy the laid back small town charms of Mandi , this is the best place - economical and efficient.",piyush2604,/Profile/piyush2604,"New Delhi, India",40
