mandi,"I have no words for Krishna camps. These guys are very cooperative and helpfull. I will prefer everyone if you are coming Parashar prefer Krishna camps services, these guys are very cooperative. And they are providing you experience team leader for the trek. Trek leader name was Raj and I have never seen a person like him, he always cooperate in every situation, even though he is a good photographer. So I'll suggest every one if you visit Parashar contact kishna camps.",Pramudit,/Profile/Pram1233,,50

mandi,"The camping tents were really cool , very nice ; compact but comfortable .   The camp was quite unhygienic in terms of washrooms and needed a little more lights at important places if not the whole camp .   The water provision was highly poor .   The guides were good  But the transportation was very questionable as it expected us to switch buses in odd wee hours for no apparent reasons but merely for occupancy issues .",Eshita Nigam,/Profile/Eshitanigam1995,,30

mandi,"Kishna camps truly deserves a 5- star rating for the type of services they provide. They really tried their best and were successful in making our trip a memorable one. Would also give a 5-star rating to our trek guide for being patient on the trek. All the members of the kishna camps and specially Kishna ji were there to fulfil our needs. One of our team members left her wallet in the camps, kishna ji took a step forward and drove extra 2.5 kms to return it to us. Really thank you kishna camps for all of this. Would definitely recommend this!!",Shreyashi singh,/Profile/shreyashis2019,,50
