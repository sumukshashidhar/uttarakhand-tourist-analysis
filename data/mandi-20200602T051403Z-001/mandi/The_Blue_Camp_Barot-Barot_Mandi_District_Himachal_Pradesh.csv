mandi,"The very first impression of this beautiful Camp is Wow. Nestled in the Barot valley, adjacent to river stream with the carpet of green across the camp.. this is a Paradise to be in with family and friends.    Tents are spacious and sparkling clean, kitchen crew and other staff are courteous and with never say NO attitude. Food is A Grade  , be it Breakfast or Meals.   Best feature is the founder who is an adventurist himself and takes you to waterfall rappelling, trekking, and paragliding. He is involved with every tiny detail and ensures his guests have a pleasant stay in the mountains.  I recommend Blue Camp for every family who wants to live out of box travel and experience flora and fauna and add some adrenaline rush to their life.
