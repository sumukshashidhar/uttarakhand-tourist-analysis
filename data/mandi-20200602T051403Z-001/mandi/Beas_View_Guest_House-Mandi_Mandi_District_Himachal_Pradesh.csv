mandi,"We were returning from Manali and our bus stopped at this place at midnight. There are around 10 Volvo buses were parked alongside the road.  I heard about this place from my friend and he recommended not to stop at this place.  I asked the bus driver to stop somewhere else but he refused as the bus service forced them to stopped at this restaurant only.  We have no option so we entered in the restaurant and the bad part of the trip started  1: At first glance, the so-called restaurant looks below average 2: Poor toilet and the long queue of people waiting for there turn as there are 4 toilets only 3: I felt bad to hear about the condition of female toilets, never-ending queue, smelly, no toilet papers, no soap. Just one-word ""Horrible""  Somehow we refreshed our self and move to",tanuj,/Profile/tanujvishnoi1991,,10

mandi,we stopped here while traveling from manali to delhi. i don't know why every bus stops here. maybe they have fixed up some quota or something. food is limited and is highly charged. staff is not good. there is no other good option nearby so one has to get down and go there.,Aakash K,/Profile/AakashK190,"New Delhi, India",10
mandi,"Buses to Manali and from Manali stop there. This may  be due to tie up with the drivers or bus operators. Sleepy and weary travelers get down from the bus to find only this hotel.   The menu items are too expensive. For example, Raita is Rs 160 and you cant order half plate or quarter plate.   This is looting at its best.",martin j,/Profile/martinj3875,,20
mandi,"We stopped to the Beas view for our dinner while traveling from Manali to Delhi. I found, every bus stops there only. First of all, the food was limited option. The Thali was priced at Rs. 250 and the quality as well as taste was sub standard.  You have credit card, cash, payTM etc as payment option. Staff is OK, not so great, location is good.",Nomad Govind,/Profile/hopegovind,"Mumbai, India",20
