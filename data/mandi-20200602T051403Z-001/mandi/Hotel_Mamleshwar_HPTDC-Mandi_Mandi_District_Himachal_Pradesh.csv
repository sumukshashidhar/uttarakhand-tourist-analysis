I was mesmerized by the views surrounding Chindi. The weather in Chindi was very pleasant. Chindi is a perfect destination if you are seeking for tranquility. There are only two properties in Chindi if you want to stay here. One is the PWD rest house and other is the HPTDC Mamleshwar. I stayed at HPTDC Mamleshwar.

Then take the route towards Jubarhatti instead of going to Shimla and drive to Chindi via Ghanahatti to Dhami to Tattapani. This route has 1) Good Roads 2) Scenic Views 3) Less Traffic 4) Plenty to places to stop and eat.  We made our booking online and the check-in process was smooth.

Linen was clean and new. The only issue is that rooms are carpeted and people with dust allergy might face some issues. There is not much in the village and one is dependent of the hotel for food but no complaints. We had a medical emergency and the nearest doctor (at night) was 15 kms away at Civil Hospital in Karsog. Amazingly helpful people and a hospital that could match any private one anywhere.

While it mentions and pops up when one searches for Mandi, it is nowhere close to the city. Instead, is in a fairly far off location called Sundernagar (takes about 4 hours from Mandi City) What was more frustrating is that we kept calling the place through the day for help on the location.

It is a new property of Himachal Tourism[ HPTDC] , well maintained with reasonably  good facilities,considering the remote location and a friendly Hotel Management/Staff. Landscaping around the Resort is charming or it will be more appropriate to say that its natural surroundings are just beautiful by default.  For  travellers who wish to visit attractions like "" Karsog town  ,  Karsog Valley "" , ancient  Mamleshwar  temple at Karsog and  Mata  Kamakskadevi temple at  Kao and of course the apple",Hem B,/Profile/HemMumbai,Mumbai,40

mandi,"On my family trip to Kullu we happened to take a overnight break due to heavy rains in Mandi (H.P.), in Munish Resorts. The location was good away from town's hustle, opposite to NH-21 (manali road),but within town's limit. On one side there is historic ""Gurudawara"", on one side beautiful temple of ""Mata Bheemakali "" and fascinating Bhuli bridge over river Beas. The resort staff was very warm and professional in approach, rates were standard and services were ""Deluxe"". Next time when I'll visit Manali (H.P.) with my family I'll definitely stay in this ""Munish Resort"" in Mandi. It's worth staying here and worth recommending as well. It adds value to your money.....It's ""Home away from Home"".",MumbaiPrem,/Profile/MumbaiPrem,Mumbai,50
mandi,"At 2000mts height in Chindi, this place is ideal for relaxing and enjoying the nature.  About 4 hrs from Shimla beyond Naldhera and Tattapani.  Staff here is good, food is of limited variety but nice, like home.  Ideal for those who look forward to get away from crowded hill stations.",SandiipBhatia,/Profile/SandiipBhatia,New Delhi,40

mandi,"The Mamleshwar is HPTDC's hotel at Chindi, a small village at 1900m altitude, surrounded by apple orchards.  In fact, the Mamleshwar is right next to an apple orchard and has several apple trees within its premises.  They were in full pink - white blossom during our visit!  The hotel has adequate parking facilities.  Check in was quick , service was warm and extra courteous, the room that we took was comfortable and entirely finished in wood.  An attached small balcony opened up into a pine forest with pretty Himalayan song birds providing entertainment every morning.  The only grouse I have with The Mamleshwar is the food.  All they had were peas.  No doubt that the Karsog valley peas are the tastiest ever but how many times can you eat peas?   The staff apologised for the lack",G A,/Profile/Gita-TA,India,40
mandi,"A wonderful location and a bit difficult drive, but totally worth it. With my senior citizen parents, the steps at hotel were difficult to climb but for younger generation it is a must visit place.  Donot forget to climb the hill behind the hotel. Awesome view and tons of apples around. The temple in the village Chindi is amazingly beautiful. Paneer parantha is worth trying.",RohitJain-Delhi,/Profile/RohitJain-Delhi,"New Delhi, India",40
