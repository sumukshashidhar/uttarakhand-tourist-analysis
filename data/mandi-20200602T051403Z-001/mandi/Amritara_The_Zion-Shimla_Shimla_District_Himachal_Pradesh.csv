And this time again I won‚Äôt deny I was fulfilled with all my expectations. The staff is very helpful and polite, food is really nice and Hotel is very clean. The location of the hotel is also very good. Def recommending all my friends/ family and going to come here again soon! A wonderful escape far to the hills from Delhi. Thank you Zion :) ",Vaishali Bisht,/Profile/vaishalibisht,,50
mandi,"My husband and I stayed at The Zion for four nights at the end of February and enjoyed our stay very much. The hotel manager, Zirender, was extremely helpful and even assisted us in obtaining Inner Line Permits for a separate trip which was above and beyond what we expected.   All of the staff were extremely helpful and very polite. The room service is excellent and the food options varied and tasty.   The view from our room was absolutely stunning and our room was extremely comfortable.   The WiFi was slightly temperamental on the second floor, but I‚Äôm sure that was just teething problems given that the hotel was only recently opened.   Would recommend The Zion to anyone visiting Shimla!",Claire S,/Profile/E8283EJclaires,United Kingdom,50
mandi,"I stayed in this property during the long weekend of Holi for 3 nights, with my spouse and a 5 year old. The property is new but the way it is managed makes it feel like a well oiled machine.The rooms are clean, the food options, though limited, are made well. The food isnt overtly spicy, hence suits all palates including that of kids.  There is ample parking in the basement so your car/bike is safely tucked in. The service staff is very polite and attentive, without being intrusive.  They dont have a bar license yet, so do take your own alcohol. There is a shop not too far though (less than 10 mins drive), towards Shimla.  The view from the room towards the valley was lovely, specially at night where the entire city feels like a glittering stars. We really enjoyed our stay",samarth27,/Profile/samarth27,india,50

mandi,"What an amazing venture. Everything is top notch here. The food, the rooms, the view, the service. Special mention to the chef and the concierge. I have stayed at so many hotels in the metropolis, but the sheer simplicity and the style of the entire hotel is absolutely breathtaking. No amount of espresso coffee machines or expensive snacks in the room minibar can substitute for the basic amenities provided in here. The staff is the best. I'll recommend this hotel to anybody and everybody who wants to relax and spend their vacations in peace. ",Freedom745340,/Profile/Freedom745340,,50
mandi,"When your travelling you can stay anywhere, but the ""View"" is from the top!! Located on a hill top Zion has the most spectacular view that I have ever experienced, you can see the whole of Simla. Plus an amazing valley and then the mountains. During the night you can see Simla and all of the neibouring villages lit up and every now and then you can see remote lights flashing from the head lamps of vehicles moving through the remote roads!  The greatest entertainer, the king of Pop (Michael Jackson) always had a fancy for spectacular views and would often stay in switzerland watching the mountains, the view from Zion exactly looks  similar to one of his Swiss hotel that he used to stay.  The hotel in general is very well planned, the restuarant again has amazing views and even",Bhushan V,/Profile/BhushanV26,,50

mandi,"My pleasure presenting first review of new hotel in Shimla ‚Äì The Zion, a modernist structure in the capital city of unforgettable Himachal. This hotel located near Sankat Mochan temple and offers stunning view of mall road as it located on good height.  With an inventory of 42 rooms and A conference hall to accommodate 60-80 people, this hotel will soon make it presence felt. I know it would be too early to comment on about hospitality, but owner of this property taking no chance as  entire staff in this hotel seems to have decent experience to handle all kind of clients under the leadership of GM Mr Girish Mago",Amit Batra,/Profile/batrasecret,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
mandi,"We happened to be passing Shimla on a trip beyond it, and happened to hear about this new hotel, The Zion, having opened a few days back. So drove up, and found they did have room available.     Turned out to be a very wise decision going there. Everything was above par. Staff conduct, Reception ambiance, the spacious room, eye to detail and comfort, and most importantly, the food was excellent.     The hotel is removed from the usually congested parts of the city, so rather easy to reach. And for anyone destined southwards by car, the location should be saving at least 30 minutes of the harrowing traffic.     Only thing missing was some space to sit in the open, but that appears to apply to practically any hotel in the city.     I do not think we shall be considering any other",Satish K,/Profile/satishk618,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
mandi,"Stayed at the hotel while going to Kinnaur for a holiday as well as returning home to Delhi.  Reached Zion on the afternoon of 21st October 2017 to a very warm reception by the staff followed by total and good care of our car and baggage.    Lunch to our individual tastes was served without any delay and can be termed excellent in all respects. Same goes for dinner.  Turning for Zion happens to be exactly at the milestone showing distance to Shimla as 5 km. One of the best features thus is not having to crawl in fits & starts in the rush of the city. Even in October, we found heavy traffic when we went over to the Mall Road by local taxi. An even better feature turned out to be availability of a shuttle service from Scandal Point to the Court Complex located 500 m from the",Avichal M,/Profile/avichalm,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",50
