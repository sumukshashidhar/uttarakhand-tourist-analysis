mandi,The hotel is at a prime location. The room was very beautiful and spacious. The room and the washroom were super clean even when all rooms were packed and the staff was too busy. We just loved being in the room !,wahl123,/Profile/wahl123,"Indore, India",40
mandi,"No Hot water, no drinking water, no food,I calls many time  for recharge of Tata sky but they ignore it. maintenance & cleaning zero.staff was unprofessional,they don't know about how to handle the guest complaints.very strong smoke smell in the room. Over all  my very bed experience. When I was going to check out Desk staff  pressures me you have  to pay at list 1200/- Very bed attitude.",Jaswal26,/Profile/Jaswal26,"Manali, India",10

mandi,"Dont be fooled by its location here on Tripadvisor or Goibibo etc, this place is at Ner Chownk, about 10km before Mandi while coming from Delhi.  The new bypass is up and running so dont take that if u want to stay here. Entrance is a bit shoddy but there is ample parking once inside. Rooms are big (we took 209 and 210) but have no view at all. Service was okayish - for example no bournvita for kids so they had to do with milk and sugar. Likewise no straws available. They do have a solar geyser though which is nice. We paid 2500 per room (including extra bed) and this was high but i guess the hotel knew the extra rush due to the massive snowfall at Manali.

mandi,"I was driving from Delhi to Manali.  The HPTDC resorts are too early to stop.  Based on the driving distance and not wanting to do hills in the night, I decided to stop near Mandi.  This was a good choice.   After a lot of research and based availability, I chose to stop at Himgiri Resorts.  It is more of a B&B and just okay for the night halt - nothing more.  The board on the main roads scare you off, but it's entry is from the side.  Inside there is adequate space.  Rooms were spacious and the rooms have hot & cold.  This is a big plus as it makes your life easier after a long day's drive.  The  service was slow.  Food was good.   As a stand alone property, I would not rate it high but I guess in Mandi area it is one of the best options.  ",yudhs,/Profile/yudhs,"New Delhi, India",40
