mandi,I stayed here with my husband for two nights and loved the experience. The owner Vinay is very hospitable and knowledgeable about various trekking spots in the nearby surroundings. The food was absolutely delicious and I loved how it feels like a community experience for all the guests staying here. I would totally recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Jhanjheli.,Manjit Rialch,/Profile/Manjit_50,"New Delhi, India",50
mandi,"This might be the best hotel in Janjheli valley considering all aspects. From the moment we walked in, my family felt right at home. The cozy fire, the warm and welcoming staff, and of course, the beautifully decorated rooms with incredible views made this a wonderful stay.   The room was very comfortable and we loved sitting out on our balcony admiring the valley from our sunkissed balcony.  The food was divine and there was something for everyone.The staff went out of their way to make sure that we were happy. They recommended some wonderful local sight seeing within close distance. The owner himself stays at property and was absolutely kind and very helpful.  Janjheli is a small scenic village. It's a hidden gem waiting to be explored.
