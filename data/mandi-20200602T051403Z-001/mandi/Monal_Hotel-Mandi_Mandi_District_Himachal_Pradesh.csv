mandi,A very basic hotel. Not professionally run. The price is not fixed. They charge whatever they feel like. We stayed here as we were held up in the night due to bad weather. We had no other choice. You can see the highway and a small river from the hotel terrace. They serve food on the terrace if you like.,Sailaja S,/Profile/SailajaS2,,20
mandi,"I stayed for approx. 5hrs here with friends. Its bang on the main road, at start of mandi town with small river at the backside of the hotel. We didn't had much time for checking the food but they have their kitchen as such. The TV not working, toilet seat broken. We were not provided the toiletries or towels, may be because of our very odd timing of checking-in.",drdb03,/Profile/drdb03,"New Delhi, India",30

mandi,"Hotel is situated in a fantastic location by the river approx 1.5km from the main market. Guess that is about it. Upon arrival, we were showed an nice, big room with tv and river view available for INR 700. After we alighted from the auto rickshaw, the staff who showed us the room informed that the room is taken! As we were extremely tired to find another hotel as it was already late at night, we just take another room at the back for INR 600. Manager immediately asked for our passports to lodge in their entry book. After 3 hours, we asked for our passports back and he gradually opened his drawer (which he kept our passports) only to start writing! He returned them after we were back from dinner.TV is available but not working at all. We have to ask three times going back and",Ida M,/Profile/IdaM940,"Singapore, Singapore",10
