mandi,"This is a really attractively designed building, situated conveniently across the bridge, not far from the bus station.  I stayed here for several days, and felt very comfortable in my small, cozy room.  The view from the rooftop is excellent for taking photos or just relaxing and passing time.  The young manager and his assistant are very friendly.  I had to change my departure date from Delhi due to incidents in Punjab, and both of these people were extremely helpful in helping me make date changes with Air India.  I would have been in serious trouble without their kind assistance.  I can definitely recommend this hotel, and will be staying again the next time I go to Mandi.  I can highly recommend this hotel.  Thank you once again to the kind and helpful hotel managers there.",Roger P,/Profile/RogerP1513,,50

mandi,"Room was very dirty, bed sheet was used and not cleaned. No room service, as per hotel condition and location rate is too high. Suggest you don't prefer this type of hotel, many hotels are there in mandi area which provide good service.",Subhendu B,/Profile/SubhenduB24,"Kolkata, India",40
mandi,"The room was very small, and the water wasn't hot. I found a way better hotel at cheaper price. Also the guys at Sangam fleeced extra money. Do not go on the basis of photographs you see. The room really is very small, no charging points and even the bathroom was very small. Also terrible service.",rudraaksh23,/Profile/rudraaksh23,,10
mandi,"So I booked the Cheapest room in this hotel in advance for two nights via booking.com and when I ""checked in"", the employee asked no questions whatsoever just showed us a room, copied our passports and had us pay with no receipt very unofficial.  The room was alright-- it's a budget hotel we realized this-- the sheets weren't very clean, the bed felt like cardboard and there was a tv but with no cable, also no restaraunt or wifi but the hotel is located near several delicious dhabas so it wasn't a problem. It's also located directly across the bridge near the bus stand.  Unfortunately by our second day our hotel was asking for more payment because apparently we were put into the most expensive room without being asked or notified. In fact, they never had checked that I had a",Ariana P,/Profile/811arianap,"Berkeley, California",30
mandi,Its a clean little place close to Mandi bus stop. If you are planning to visit rewalsar or prashar lake then this is a good place to halt for the night. Be ready to climb a complex set of stairs to reach your room and there are some fall hazards inside the room as well.,shubhrangsu,/Profile/shubhrangsu,"Chandigarh, India",30
