The rooms are extremely well appointed and shows attention to the smallest detail.  The linen and toiletries are of a high standard. Adequate heating was available to mitigate the surprisingly cold weather for mid-March.   As occupancy levels were low, probably due to seasonal factors, our meals were personalised with adequate care being taken to ensure variety and quality. Service, as usual, was excellent.   The property is well maintained with the garden being a very comfortable space to sit out on a lazy, sunny afternoon. The housekeeping tea are a bunch of 4 ladies who work efficiently in tandem.

This happens when a great property is being managed by nice but a little less trained and unprofessional team that will surely end up providing very inconsistent service and variability in experience.  Making hotel reservation is very unprofessional. Hotel website gives facility of online reservations but navigation could be better.

The plumbing in our bathroom leaked but otherwise it was a pleasant experience.   One disappointment is the lack of training of the staff on how to guide guests wishing to hike, walk and explore the area.
