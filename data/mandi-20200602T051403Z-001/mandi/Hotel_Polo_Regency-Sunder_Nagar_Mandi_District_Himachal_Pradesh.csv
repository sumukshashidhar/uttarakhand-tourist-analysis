mandi,"I loved my stay. Luxurious rooms, delicious food, hospitality is excellent, and the the view of lake is cherry on the cake. Parking is good and they have terrace space too.I would love to visit again.",Malvika,/Profile/Malvika12345,,50
mandi,"Check-in was fast. Rooms were big and had both airconditioning and a ceiling fan. I got laundry done and it came back wet. There was a storm and power cuts and there didn't appear to be any standby power, we lost the internet and the lift after the storm. Got a slight electrical shock of the taps in the shower. The food was tasty and came out quickly but the dining room hadn't been cleaned from the night before when I had breakfast. There are no room safe. They tried to charge me for meals I paid for when I ate them and for my prepaid room when I checked out. This place is not close to much to see as a tourist.",bozobrain,/Profile/bozobrain,"Darwin, Australia",30
mandi,"We stayed in this hotel on our way to Manali. Since we got very late and had been driving for a long time we decided to stop and stay at Sundar Nagar. This property is visible from the highway on the right hand side. It has good rooms, good food and courteous staff. We stayed overnight and really liked our stay there.",shalini2910,/Profile/shalini2910,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
mandi,We had booked 3 deluxe rooms in the hotel for one night during our journey back from Manali online and made necessary payment for our stay.  On our reaching the hotel at about 5 pm we found one person at the reception. It took sone time for him to allot us our rooms inspite of the fact that we had made a couple of phone calls informing the hotel staff of our arrival time. There was no bell boy to help us with our bags and its only after a long delay one person came to take our bags from the reception area. Also inspite of the fact we had made online advance payment there was a bit of problem as the person at the reception was unaware of the same till ee showed him our emails and bank confirmation of the transfer of funds. The rooms were spacious but lacked the neat and clean,Prominparalkar,/Profile/Prominparalkar,"Noida, India",20
mandi,"Stayed here with my family enroute to Manali. We had booked 2 regular AC rooms for a night.   Rooms - big rooms along with huge bathrooms, but both are in dire need of maintenance.   Service - Slow and disappointing service, and hereâ€™s why - when we checked in we noticed our rooms had a lot mosquitos so we asked for All -Outs for each room. My mother called room service twice but did not get it, then she asked for an extra pillow, which after calling thrice and being reassured the service attendent was on his way, still was not given. Eventually they came around giving the pillow, which happened to have a cockroach in the pillow case. The next morning we came down for breakfast at 9 pm in their restaurant, it was deserted, with a lady moping the floor. We had to call the front",Neha Z,/Profile/NehaZ9,,20
mandi,This is undoubtedly the best hotel in Sundernagar on the main highway  We took the Super Deluxe room on the 3rd Floor which was really spacious and lake facing.. the food was good.. we tried fish trout which was freshly prepared.. the breakfast was not that great.. neither the omelette nor the crispy toast or coffee  But the room and the lovely terrace made up for all the inadequacies,Vipul556,/Profile/Vipul556,"Mussoorie, India",40
mandi,sepuwadi ( a himachai dish)  is what i loved here.. nice food.. good sorrounding .. the hotel staff was nice and co-opeartive. all in all a superb place to visit . the hotel is at the centre of the city adjacent to the popular lake,637deee,/Profile/637deee,,40
mandi,"We stayed here for 3 nights when my husband and daughter went for a trek nearby. Beautiful view overlooking the lake, clean rooms and good food. Service was good as well. Recommend if visiting for lunch when going to Manali or for a transit stay. ",Rashmidh,/Profile/Rashmidh,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
mandi,"I have been to this place while i was on the way to Kulu from Shimla during my trip in May 2017. I must say again the first thing that is good is the food, you must try trout fish as that is the best you get here. We tried a lot of dishes and were over all happy. The hotel is good for staying if you wish to visit SunderNagar during your travel from Shimla to Kulu.The staff is friendly and will help if you need anything. I must say i recommend this hotel.",SudiptaChatt,/Profile/SudiptaChatt,"Kolkata, India",50
mandi,"The room was clean, the staff was courteous. The food they served was fresh, the room packages do not include breakfast. Their room service is only available till 10:30 PM, which is inconvenient if you check in late at night while traveling further up. Parking is available for cars which is good.",Nimish Pande,/Profile/pandenimish,,40
mandi,"The hotel is conveniently located. The rooms are decent, with the basic amenities. However, the staff and the service is terrible!! They made us feel as if we will run away without settling the food bills, even when our stay was all paid in advance by the company and our luggage was also with them. We were rushing for our morning meeting, but they did not let us go until we paid the meagre food bills, that too all in cash as the debit/credit POS machines don't work. And by the way, the food wasn't any good either. No wi-fi as well!!",Sunpreet,/Profile/Sunpreet_Traveller,"New Delhi, India",20

Rooms are beautiful, but please look for top floor rooms.. Third floor!!! which r best in hotel. They have to work on service !!!!!   ",puri_chahat,/Profile/puri_chahat,"Jammu, India",40
mandi,The hotel gives free wi-fi but is not available in all rooms due to weak signals. The service is slow. Takes a lot of time to serve food. Rooms are clean. Location is good. It is near Bus stand as well as close to national Highway,Sunilkoul,/Profile/Sunilkoul,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",30
mandi,"We were looking for a place to spend the night on our way to Manali from Chandigarh, browsing the net on the way I chanced upon this one and decided to walk in.   Greeting polite and the rates though on the higher side given the town were still reasonable.   Rooms are clean, spacious with a clean big bathroom. Heater is provided in the room but when I asked for another heater as it was very cold it was declined by the reception claiming they don't have an extra one. (What is the one already in my room had developed a malfunction?)  Bathroom as mentioned clean and big and with a well thought exhaust fan for smokers like me. Geyser efficient with ample hot water both in the shower and basin.   But the commode was fixed too high from the floor, not comfortable and this is coming",veeraj,/Profile/veeraj,"Mumbai, India",30
mandi,"Big, spacious and tidy rooms with good infrastructure. On the highway and you may also opt for a river facing room. Food was good. We tried both in room dining and the restaurant. Safe parking available if you are driving down. Overall value for money.",Varun Wadhwa,/Profile/varunwadhwa2019,Delhi,50
mandi,"The hotel is perfect for a mid-way break on the way to Manali/Kasol. The location opposite the lake offers a relaxing sight and rejuvenates for the journey ahead. The rooms are spacious and the food is a delight. We ordered only veg so can vouch for that. If we plan another uphill trip, would definitely stay here to break the journey.",onthemove12498,/Profile/onthemove12498,"Chandigarh, India",40
mandi,"We started off from Delhi at 8am and reached Sunder Nagar at 8pm with 2 breaks. Place is easily accessible from NH21. Just cross the market and as you see lake on your left, this hotel you can easily locate on the right.  There was no bargaining as hotel is famous among tourists and only chance to bargain is book over phone or may be you are lucky enough to go in a offseason. They have 3 different type of rooms and I liked in particular top 2 with rent being 3000 and 3500.  Restaurant service is a bit slow and if you are planning to leave early by say before 7am, forget having breakfast here.  Room size is okie and they have geysers in rooms.  Value for money",Rakesh,/Profile/Rakesh37,"New Delhi, India",40
mandi,"On the drive from Delhi to Manali, had stopped over for a night. Great just for this purpose. The hotel was newly opened and therefore the stay pleasant. The food was good. The service was nothing to write home about.",NeoInRio,/Profile/NeoInRio,"New Delhi, India",30

mandi,One of the good places to stay enroute to shimla or manali. You have the market nearby in case you need to buy winter clothes. Spacious and clean rooms with parking. Good bargain if you get it at discounted price. Its proximity to the lake ( man made) is an added advantage. You can visit the high range forest area from here. ,Haridas M,/Profile/782haridasm,,40
mandi,"The Polo Regency is a fairly new hotel. The room we had was spacious and very comfortable. The en-suite bathroom was clean and spacious. So first impressions were very favourable.  We saw the very tatty menu after we unpacked and it seemed OK. But what a disappointment we had in store for us. We chose the Lemon Chicken which can best be described as a brutally chopped up chicken with most of the meat removed and served in an insipid source. Bones with bits of meat hanging off is not an exaggeration. Even had it been edible, the portion size was inadequate. A complete waste of what was possibly a good chicken.  We also had a mushroom dish where the mushrooms were hard and barely cooked.  Finally there was a rice dish that was reasonable.  Coffee was a small receptacle of instant",RyedaleRambler,/Profile/RyedaleRambler,Yorkshire,30
mandi,The food they served was far below average. The tandoori chicken was almost raw and repulsive. The rooms are quite good from inside but there was no view. Nobody was available to pick the luggage at the time of checkout.               ,254kamalc,/Profile/254kamalc,"Jammu, India",30

mandi,"We used this hotel while on our way to Manali. We had an option of staying either at Sunder Nagar or Mandi but opted for this hotel as it was before Mandi hence avoided driving for approx. another hour on the hills in the night. The hotel is conveniently located on the highway enroute to Manali & is a good option to break the journey while going to Manali. The rooms are decent with all the basic amenities & the food is also quite good. Although, cleanliness might be an issue if you are really fussy about everything been really clean. The hotel also does not have a large parking space & if it gets full, the vehicle would have to be parked on the road.  Basically, everything you can expect from a transit hotel while travelling further up in Himachal &    if you are not looking for",Suhas A,/Profile/suhasawasthi,"New Delhi, India",40
mandi,"The Hotel is right on NH 21 ahead of the market and in front of the lake. The rooms are nice, spacious and clean. The service is good and the food is tasty. A perfect place to spend a night while on the way to Manali. There is very limited space fro parking inside the premises so park your car as soon as you see the parking available.",Rakesh71,/Profile/Rakesh71,"New Delhi, India",40
mandi,I was travelling to Manali and looking for a place to stay 5 hours short of Manali. Mandi town was one of the options but Polo Regency in Sunder Nagar 21 kms before Mandi was a better option. This is located very near the beatiful lake. Hotel has all the facilities of a 3 star property. Busstand Sunder Nagar is walkable from Hotel. Rooms are spacious and good. Sunder Nagar  is a nice and beatiful town in H.P. Recomended to travellers on the way to Manali.,rajeshdogar,/Profile/rajeshdogar,"Hanoi, Vietnam",30
mandi,"I travelled to Sundernagar on two ocassions, both were business visits. I researched and couldnt find much about hotels at sundernagar so i didnt  prebook any of it. I reached there and checked into Polo regency. I must say the rooms are very good and very nicely done. The food is also very good. Its a place which is perfect for business travellers. The owner of the property is  nice man and assures that you feel comfortable and taken care of at all times. On my first visit there was no WiFi but on the second one they manged to get it done. Overall: You can go for it without any hitch, just dat i feel it is a bit Overpriced..",MitulExplorer,/Profile/MitulExplorer,"New Delhi, India",40
