mandi,"Had great fun lovely environment, not a crowded place , best place to stay with family and friends to enjoy great time or for party like I had. Food is good so as the staff of the hotel. Hotel is also quite clean and well furnished",705onams,/Profile/705onams,,40
mandi,"We stayed here in November 2016 during our motorcycle ride to Prashar Lake. We wer looking for a budget friendly and checked in to this hotel. Rooms were very clean, big and comfortable. Geyser was working properly and we had no issues staying in this hotel. Owner was also helpful and helped us with directions to Prashar Lake and some other places to visit in Mandi. This is on the main road, just opposite to the main market in Mandi town.",RaminderP_Singh,/Profile/RaminderP_Singh,"New Delhi, India",50
mandi,"So Lonely Planet lists this place and Evening Plaza as budget options in Mandi.  I lived in both and for all intensive purposes, they are pretty much exactly the same.  At Shiva's, they did offer a room that was even cheaper than Evening Plaza (100 rupees less) but it's also smaller as well (might be good for a solo traveler).  Nevertheless, the room we chose (which was the same rate as Evening) was the same.    Clean, cheap, close to the bus station, overall a decent stay.",NeoAxion,/Profile/NeoAxion,"Detroit, Michigan",40
