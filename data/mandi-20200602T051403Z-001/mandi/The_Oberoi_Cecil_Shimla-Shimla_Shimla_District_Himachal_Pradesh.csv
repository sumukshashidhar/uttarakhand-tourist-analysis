mandi,After an 8 hour drive we were delighted to arrive at the hotel. Our timing was good as no sooner had we checked in than two very large groups of train buffs arrived and took the place over. We were shown to our Luxury Rooms with wonderful views over Shimla to the mountains  beyond.  There was tea and coffee and bottled water available.  The rooms certainly were beautifully fitted out and the bathrooms had all modern facilities done in a traditional way. After a walking tour on the first day I booked in for a foot and leg massage in the spa which was excellent. There were two large dining rooms which were full of groups and another area which were tables off a central walkway with people coming and going.  We felt pushed out by the groups.

Whilst doubtless steeped in history the rooms on the road side of the hotel are very very noisy.  Granted they are quite a bit quieter at night when there are some restrictions on access and egress to the road but during the day the noise spoils the enjoyment of the room.  Apparently the only way to get away from this is to pay more money subject to availability.  Whilst the staff were lovely the service was extremely slow, even by India's standards.  It was not uncommon to have to request drinks/ orders from the bar several times before they arrived.

You don't expect to find dirty drapes in your room, dirty walls of the balcony and broken glass on the ornamental door leading to the room. Further, the bathroom fittings are from an age gone by.

The professional staff add significantly to the experience and do everything to ensure that each request is met with a smile and responded to.   The only slip up was that we were initially not given a room on a higher floor as we had requested when we made the booking and an alternate room took almost 1.5 hours to get ready after we had seen it...other than this hiccup we had a lovely stay.",GautamB033,/Profile/GautamB033,,50

The temperature controlled swimming pool was great. We took a stroll to Mall road from the hotel and the hotel car picked us up on the way back. We also used the hotel transport to go to the Glen - which is a great forest walk. Food and the lounge was good and they packed us a huge breakfast since we had to catch a morning flight from Chandigarh. The spa head massage and thai massage was good. The foot massage was not upto the mark and I really hope they improve that since there will be many folks like me - tired after the long adventures in shimla and manali.,Arati,/Profile/Arati,Mumbai,40

The best part of the hotel was the atrium-lounge- great for afternoon tea or cocktails. The buffet breakfast was fantastic and our servers did their best to make our meal a wonderful one whether it was getting freshly baked croissants for us or specially having fresh orange juice made, which was not on the buffet. The Eggs Benedict was delightful. The in-dining fare was reasonably priced, if a little uninspiring.

The distant views from the room are impressive, the near views are less appealing. Whilst the other hotels have been oases of calm, the Cecil is right in amongst everything.

The location of the hotel means that it is a pleasant stroll into the heart of Shimla or a quick taxi ride to the lifts.  My only quibble is that for a twin bedded room the beds were very close together - perhaps any future room changes could consider having at least 1 metre between beds with the bedside tables between rather than on the outside of the 2 beds.,Jackys014,/Profile/Jackys014,"Dartford, United Kingdom",50

mandi,"Shimla (or Simla - take your choice) was our favourite part of India and the Cecil was one of the best hotels we stayed in.  Service was outstanding (although, to be honest, there were only 28 rooms booked while we were there - it was off-season, but we lucked out on weather). But I digress.  At one point, we heard a beeping sound and went out our door to see what was happening. We saw a hotel employee on a floor below us (there's an open atrium that all rooms look down into). He gave us a ""don't worry"" wave and as we walked back into the room, our phone rang with a voice on the other end assuring us that it was only a test of the fire warning system. That's service.  The meals were excellent, the staff all knew our name almost immediately after we checked in. We were given a",22man,/Profile/22man,"Saratoga Springs, New York",50
mandi,"After a 6 hour ride on the ""toy train"", we arrived to the heaviest snowfall in 100 years. Shimla is beautiful. The Cecil is superb. It is run soooo well. They treat you like royalty. Rooms are lovely, warm and with everything you need. Views from the restaurant and the food itself are superb. You don't like an item...they go and offer you other choices! Its just a lovely hotel in a lovely place. Well done to all the staff for making our stay so memorable ",syvchig,/Profile/syvchig,London UK,50
mandi,"Arrived here after a long and windy 8 hour road trip from Amritsar and couldnt have been happier with what we found. Pleasant and courteous staff , beautiful rooms , good service and excellent restaurant and room menu. The staff were very helpful and efficient without being over bearing ,which can happen in India .  The location is perfect, at the end of the pedestrian Mall which leads through the town. Breathtaking views from the rooms and keep an eye out for the cheeky monkeys! The swimming pool although cool was lovely and the jacuzzi looked out towards the mountains. Shimla is definitely worth the trip  and so is the Cecil. This hotel is worth every penny , excellent value for money .  Looking forward to returning here again someday.

mandi,Excellent place in Shimla--well located and quiet.  Really first class and the service is excellent--they anticipate your needs without being cloying.  Food and service also very good.    Definitely recommend this place but do come to Shimla during a season when you can see the mountains---socked in with rain and fog at the moment. ,nred,/Profile/nred,"Keene, New Hampshire",40
mandi,"We just returned from staying in this wonderful property for 5 nights. It was our Wedding Anniversary and we took all our 3 girls along as well.   PROS -   1. Great property, very beautiful, well maintained - takes you back into the British era. 2. Fantastic indoor pool and jacuzzi - my kids had a blast swimming for hours on. 3. The staff was really nice and went that extra edge to make you comfortable especially the GM, Vikram and the Asst. Manager, Sukhbeen.  CONS -  1. One of the biggest hindrance's you would face (which we faced too) is that the hotel is constructed on a restricted roadd with no access to private cars. Which means, that if you come in your private vehicle(which is what we did), the car is not allowed to enter into the main road on which the hotel is",Topsmanuk,/Profile/Topsmanuk,"London, United Kingdom",40

It was the best hotel of our tour.The food was excellent,the service was quick and efficient.We were allocated a room with a view of the mountains.The bed was huge the bathroom beautiful the shower powerful and the towels were soft and white.The hotel was spotlessly clean in all places. The pool and jacuzzi like something from a film. Each day there were 2 bottles of water and 3 apples left in the room.I really cant praise this hotel highly enough. The photos in the trip advisor info about this hotel are accurate. Staying in Shimla stay in the Cecil and you wont regret it. ",bubble51,/Profile/bubble51,Washington U.K,50
mandi,"Shimla is one of the most wonderful places and the Oberoi Cecil hotel doesn't disappoint. The finishings are exquisite (wood panelling & cosy fireplaces) and the food at the main restaurant was the best during our trip (apparently the head chef for the group was there).   The manager was the only disappointment - the hotel was very empty as we were there during the off-peak season. Our room had no view whatsoever, and we asked (politely) whether we could change rooms, however, the manager flatly declined.  There is another Oberoi hotel in the area called Wildflower Hall, which is one of the most wonderful hotels I've ever visited. It takes 45 minutes to drive there from the Cecil - the restaurant has a patio with views of the snow-capped Himalayas. The weather is changeable -",Dreamer9784,/Profile/Dreamer9784,London,40
