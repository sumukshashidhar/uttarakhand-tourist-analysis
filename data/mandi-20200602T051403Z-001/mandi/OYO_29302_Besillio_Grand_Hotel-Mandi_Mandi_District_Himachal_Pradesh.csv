mandi,"Stayed here again a few days back while coming from Manali. Stayed alone. Called up and got an offer of 900. I feel for this price the hotels in Mandi (before town on right , while coming from Manali) offer a better deal. Plus point here is the huge parking. Also only non veg food here. Food is expensive and I ordered a thali that was 190 bucks. Room upkeep is average. No shampoo or toilet papers given. TV works though. Overall, not worth the money I guess.",BunnyPunia,/Profile/BunnyPunia,"New Delhi, India",30
mandi,I just stayed here for couple of hours with friends for a lunch so the few things that I know that food is very good and location of the hotel is also good near to NH with beautiful lake in front of it.  For family stay it is also good as staff is good and friendly ,705onams,/Profile/705onams,,40
mandi,"We stopped here for lunch. It's a nicely appointed place with good Indian food and prompt service, though somewhat pricey. Washrooms are clean and there is enough parking space. There is also a  separate dining hall for cab drivers.",Lalit Surjan,/Profile/lalitsurjan,"Raipur, India",40

mandi,We  have booked a super deluxe room  on 23rd April 2017 for family of 4 members on the way back from Manali to Chandigarh airport with booking advance of Rs.1260/-  We arrived around 7 pm after a long trip of 7 days with tired souls to break for rest. We have got room no 207 and shock to see ugly /muddy bathroom and no light in the bathroom. Bath towel kept was in torn conditions. We have taken up with Hotel manager who is non co operative and rude who took 2 hours to get the room little bit cleaned. They switched off electricity during night time  and  AC was not working /no light in the room/lift was not working. No one was available to attend the customers in the night time. We could not sleep whole night and no rest to us by spending   Rs.2520 rent. Food quality was very,asnayak12,/Profile/asnayak12,"Mumbai, India",10
mandi,Everything was clean and tasty. I had Chinese and north Indian Thali.  One can try starters and soups. They are also good.   It is situated in Mandi. One can reach there very easily. This place also have accommodations which could be worth trying as well.,namen b,/Profile/namenb,"Ao Nang, Thailand",40
mandi,"Pls note I stayed here alone. Was on a bike trip back from Manali and it suited my requirements perfectly well.  Paid 800 for a single room with balcony. Parking is ample though did not see a security guard there. Room size was average and so was the upkeep. However there was a balcony. Only veg food here but taste is good. TV works, bed is slightly hard but the let down is traffic noise as bang on highway.  Checked out early morning. Skipped breakfast. Staff is helpful and quick on their toes.  Recommended place if u just want to eat dinner and sleep for 6 hours before hitting the highway again. Note that there is a bad 6-8km patch just before Sundernagar (if coming from Chandigarh) side. So don't fill your belly and then hit this part of the highway (can cause nausea easily) ",BunnyPunia,/Profile/BunnyPunia,"New Delhi, India",40
mandi,"Service was okay,Just had an overnight stay  bathrooms were clean hot water was available  most of the time did not feel like the ac was working Overall an okay hotel to stay overnight after a long ride really wanted the break not sure about food as we had dinner in a close by restaurant not in the hotel",hersheys_shetty,/Profile/hersheys_shetty,"Mumbai, India",30
mandi,The worst hotel I have ever seen. Service is awful and receptionist is very shrewd. They never help their customers and for every thing you have to give 4-5 reminders. Worst Hotel. They lied to their customers and my advice to you all is that never think of staying in this hotel. WORST EXPERIENCE,Yatharth C,/Profile/YatharthC2,,10
mandi,"Just had a night halt on the way to Manali. The staff was terrible and rude. The service was even worse. Rooms were okay , not clean though. They provided one towel in a 5 bedded room and when asked for more, they said it was against hotel policy to provide it & advised to share a single towel.  PS : Only thing that was worth was the Food - tasty and quality . The service in restaurant was terrible too.  NOT RECOMMENDED",payal_admin,/Profile/payal_admin,,10
mandi,We stopped by while returning from manali for breakfast. Restaurant was cleaned. We tried chana batura and toast. Chana was tasty but took long time to serve even though there were no other customers. Batura was too thick:( tea cup wasn't cleaned. Can be skipped.,PrabhatBiswas,/Profile/PrabhatBiswas,"Bengaluru, India",20
mandi,Impressed by the neat decor and uniformed waiters; Food was also upto the mark; for those travelling from Shimla to Manali or back or Chandigarh to Manali one of the best bets right on NH21  It is ijust after SUNDERNAGAR when you are travelling towards Manali ; Not Mandi as Trip advisor has listed; Request trip advisor to point it correctly,c_sekhar,/Profile/c_sekhar,"Mumbai, India",40
mandi,"On the go from Manali to Chandigarh we stayed overnight here. Tariff was ok, but very bad service, one pillow was missing in the room and after three times personal reminder, at last i got at midnight 12:15 p.m. They starts geyser only in the morning & there was so much electric fluctuations,  you can't even take bath properly. Bedding was also dirty, & smelling. Really bad experience.",AmitTrambadia,/Profile/AmitTrambadia,"Rajkot, India",10
mandi,Though this is a hotel I am writing this review only for the restaurant that they have. We had stopped at this hotel to take a lunch break on the way from Manali to Chandigarh. We stopped here because the setup was way better than the other hotels/restaurants on the way. They have a dedicated parking place.  The ambiance was good. There is a nice view of a lake in front of this hotel. Service was good and the most important thing is the vegetarian Punjabi food that we had ordered was simple but very delicious.  In all itâ€™s a good place to take a halt in the tiring journey from Manali to Chandigarh,pritpa,/Profile/pritpa,"Pune, India",40
mandi,"On Chandigarh Manali National Highway this hotel is midway Mandi and Sundernagar. Food once tasted great now is not that good.  And they even charge for Sirka onion, which is given always complimentary at all joints of India.  Be careful while placing order.",Vineet M,/Profile/253vineetm,"Manali, India",30
