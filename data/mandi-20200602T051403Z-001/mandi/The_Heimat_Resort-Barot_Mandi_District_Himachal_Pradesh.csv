mandi,"I stayed here on 28th oct 2019 . Took two tents tent number 9 and tent 10 . There was no one for providing services . The tents are dirty and are not don't ZIp up fully which causes biting cold air to freeze you in the tents . The staff was totally disinterested . had to go to the staff tent for all requirements . The chef is the manager too and is quite blunt , There are no Trout fish in the winter months there . The arrangements for Bonfire is on a basketball shooting place . Hot water is a necessity there but the staff doesn't know which tap provides it . I was offered to go to the public bathing point for hot water . Had a disgusting experience so checked out after the night instead of staying for the second night . It has a great location with ample parking but due to",raajwin,/Profile/raajwin,"Hyderabad, India",10
mandi,"Everything was good and enjoyable there at the heimet resorts. Food quality and quantity , both were good. They should develop some activities in or around the camps. Coz there is nothing much to do in barot except trackings.  As far as the camp is concerned, they have good hospitality style.  ",Vishnu G,/Profile/676vishnug,"Jalandhar, India",50
mandi,"Those who like adventure and greenery,  the place  is meant  for those. Food is awesome.  Must visit with a group of friends  or 5-6 families  together.   Every age group person was seen enjoying on the property .  Sports  activities  like basketball amd badminton  keeps you busy  and weather of barot is so pure and pleasant.",Litin K,/Profile/litink,,50
mandi,"Except location, everything need improvement. Food quality is pathetic. Tents cleanliness is not at all good. Washroom stinks, Staff is somewhat co-operative. The only advantage of this property is location rest all is just wastage of time",Akhil Sharma,/Profile/ric_lib19,"New Delhi, India",30
mandi,"Stayed here for one night enjoyed a lot.Neat and clean tents they do not have gyser but they provide hot water.Food was finger licking, best food in entire broat. This place is 1 km before broat. They play loud music in the evening till 9:00- 9:30 pm which is very enjoyable. Highly Recommended .....",binnyguron,/Profile/binnyguron,Chandigarh,50
mandi,"Located in a underdeveloped region  with lots of potential, the resort is good compared to local peers but has lots of scope for improvement  Pros + location of its own just outside the humdrum of the local bazaar but within a walking distance + the valley itself is beautiful + the Dam is a must visit, the first in India + kitchen is good, with trout as a specialty offering  Cons - the tents are basic, with some more things that can be provided - lacks a genset for power - hot water bags can be a better bet for heating the bed as using wired oil heaters is a bit risky - the resort needs to finish as there was lots of construction activity going on at the time of visit, making it a bit dusty in the green landscape",Biplav,/Profile/Biplav,"New Delhi, India",30
mandi,"Right from space to pitch your tent to luxurious swiss tents with attached washroom and charging sockets, the Heimat resort is best value for money for solo, couple, family or groups.. I recommend this for its nice staff, great location and awesome food..",Kautilya29,/Profile/Kautilya29,"New Delhi, India",50
mandi,"I stayed at Heimat Resort from 29th Sept to 2nd October with my family and friends. We wanted to visit some serene place for this long weekend without hustle and bustle and finally zeroed down on this property. Called up the owner who is a young entrepreneur named Vivek. We inquired about the property and Barot valley as a place and he gave us complete information we wanted. Barot Valley is almost 300 kms from Chandigarh via Mandi. I traveled with my 4 years old daughter and 4 months old son so was a bit skeptical about staying in the tents but Vivek assured about everything and we finally booked it on a call with him.  ""Wow"" was the first word that came to our mind when we reached there. Very beautiful and calm place. Paradise for nature lovers and people who just want to sit",GaganSethi,/Profile/GaganSethi,Chandigarh,50
mandi,"Best place in Barot! Excellent view, wonderful tents, great food and a very nice and attentive staff.
