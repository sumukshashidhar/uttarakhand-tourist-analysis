It's not the posh kind but it gives you the needed comfort and rest.  The caretakers are nice elderly people. A kitchen is also maintained by them that gave us decent dinner and breakfast. Apart from the lake, there is a Buddhist monastry nearby. The rooms are old but clean and spacious. So is the bathroom- spacious ones with hot water available. There is no AC.
