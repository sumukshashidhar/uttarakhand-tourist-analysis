We were even treated to hot water bottles in the bed...which was very welcome during snowy weather.  The people are just lovely and worked hard to provide the very best service.

It is part of the Oberoi group which you see in the quality of service but it feels like a boutique family run place because of the staff.

It is a good location as it is close by to the shops and restaurants of the mall/town centre and also the ridge where the viewpoints and Christ Church are located.

You begin by arriving in a car park sited at the bottom of what seems to be an endless set of stairs leading up to the reception area of the hotel. This is because vehicles are not allowed on the road immediately in front of the hotel meaning that you can stroll into Shimla without the problems of traffic etc which can make walking in Indian cities particularly difficult.

It has been used as a hotel since being built in 1898, which at that time was right in the hey day of the British Empire in India using Shimla as it's Summer retreat. The building is charming if a little creaky, but quality is maintained with an excellent food offering and friendly staff. We loved it, but if you are looking for that marble and glass type of luxury hotel, then it probably wouldn't suit you. Also bear in mind that we could find no lifts in the hotel, which in all fairness would probably detract from its charm even if it was possible to install them. Rooms, reception, and restaurant are all on different levels, possibly making access difficult for less physically able people.
