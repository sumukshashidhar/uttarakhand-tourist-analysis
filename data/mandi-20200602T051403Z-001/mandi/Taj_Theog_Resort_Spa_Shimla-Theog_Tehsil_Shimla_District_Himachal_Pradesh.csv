The only draw back is the narrow road leading up to the hotel which is difficult for cars to navigate particularly when there has been snow - the snow should be cleared by the hotel to help visitors.   Another complaint is that we had to wear a coat to go to the dining room to eat as the heating was not maintained.   The service however was great.

The place is beyond dreams and offers among the best views and experiences you will ever have.  Having stayed in some uber luxury properties like the Taj Lake Palace Udaipur and the Umaid Bhavan Jodhpur, I can say hands down that Taj Theog takes the crown. The property is built on the top of the mountain and hence offers unparalleled, 360 degree views of the ranges around and the Himalayas beyond.  Since it is on the mountain top, both sunrise and sunset are breathtaking views to soak in- and there is nothing between you and the stars.  The mountain is also quite high- at 8000+ feet, so you see everything around from a majestic vantage point.

It's a beautiful place away from the rush n bustle of the hugely over populated and polluted Shimla.  Taj Theog is a new property of the Taj group. It's perched on a hillock with panoramic views of the hills n dales.  All the rooms have a view with little wooden balconies adding to the charm. One can literally feel the clouds come and embrace you. The hospitality n food at Taj Theog is on par with any other Taj. Must try the local staple called Siddu which is both sweet n savoury. The team at Taj Theog organises some lovely walks n treks around the property and a trip to a nearby apple orchard. Don't miss these.

The road is under construction, and according to estimates by various hotel staff, will take anything up to a year to complete because it involves coordinating the work of three different agencies, at the least.  That's after enduring the bone jarring, dusty and endless crawl up to and past Shimla on a badly potholed mountain road interrupted at frequent intervals by landslide repairs and new road construction.

The first thing I notice was the use of these gorgeous black Rajesthan fossil granite for most the flooring in the hotel. Where most hotels use black galaxy or some of the warmer stones, the Taj Theog stands out in its selection. This fossil stone is themed out in the welcome tables by the lift lobbies (this time hand chiseled) as well as in the showers (also hand chiseled to reveal a blast / flamed effect). It is stunning.
