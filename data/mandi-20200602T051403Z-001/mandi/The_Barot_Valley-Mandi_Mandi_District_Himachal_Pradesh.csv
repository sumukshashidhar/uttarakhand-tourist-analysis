mandi,"In the review i have also share the experience about the barot valley team in Barot. In Barot i am stay with friends in the Barot Valley Homestay. they offered a Homestay with breakfast, lunch and dinner. I am selecting a breakfast and dinner ( Dinner was awesome with a special treat).  So I Suggest you contact the Barot valley team, there are available Manoj, who is the nice guy and also guide a complete package if you are interested in camping, trekking etc.",Muneesh Sapehiya,/Profile/muneeshsapehiya,,50
