We had a room facing the valley, which gave us a fantastic view of the snow-capped mountains. They also have a spacious lawn for kids to run around in. Couple of things that could've been better - their spa service seemed under-staffed and a little unprepared. Best avoided. Also, if you're coming from Shimla, take the road through Manali. We were told to take a shorter, faster route without entering the town, but the roads were in terrible shape at the time we came. All in all, highly recommend Anantmaya, and will definitely stay here anytime I visit Manali!",nirupama s,/Profile/nirupama_siva,"Bengaluru, India",40

I had lot of good reviews of the place was quite excited and I loved the food at the place but was not happy with facilities and travel desk as their is no shuttle from hotel being so off location.  If you are looking to just stay in property then it's a good one but if you want to travel in manali then this is not the place as it's very off location and it's very expensive to travel from property to main location.  I would advise to start shuttle service!!,goelay,/Profile/goelay,"New Delhi, India",30

The location is surreal, the rooms are clean and the food is not only good value but very tasty. But all this is expected for the price. We stayed here for 9 nights and weren't given any additional benefits or deals. I was expecting a choice on the room, a welcome basket, atleast an additional space heater but nothing. If I stayed at any of the popular chains like I usually do, I'd get points that I could redeem later. I wouldn't recommend availing the travel desk facilities unless and until you have to--very pricey for the services offered. ",venkat K,/Profile/932venkatk,,30

We were told that we hv rooms booked in different categories so we have to pay extra 1000 rs per night for one room for which we agreed ..   The 2nd room allotted to us was smaller than the normal category rooms .. When at the time of checkout we told them this the owner in his arrogant attitude tells me that at the time of payment I am complaining .. I told him to take 2000 rs but we aren't satisfied .. The room didn even have a fan..the owner said that the topography is such that the room would be small..   The hotel has been newly built and there aren't air conditioners in the rooms ..

In fact, looking at their breakfast and dinner buffets - there was no need to order for more. The spread was delicious, but their hospitality infectious. So when the Tandoori Himalayan Trout and the most delectable Nargisi Koftas made our way to the table, we knew they would order on our behalf if we didn't take them up on their offer.

The rooms are beautifully done and are clean with an excellent view . The resort is a bit away from town so people who like the town crowd will not like the location. The lawns are well maintained . It's a new property so all the things look fresh. The food is excellent with decent spread and the people around like Mr prem , arun with the staff like Rakesh and suraj serve with all their heart and smile . The breakfast menu is quite repetitive which should be improved . The service is excellent . We were lucky enough to experience snow fall at the hotel .
