mandi,This is one of oldest hotel of town established 1948. With change of time and other amenities in and around have reflection on this place. With in heart of town is its importance and  with reasonable rates for day or two to stay is worth to relish.,lkkapoor,/Profile/lkkapoor,"Mandi, India",30
mandi,"I have been here in the first week of November.. They have provided all sort of common facilities like gizzard, hot water, extra blankets at very very affordable prices. Its really surprising to see that the hotel is providing such facilities at that price. Room service is also good.. If you are looking for comfortable, cheap but ordinary stay, this is the best one for you.. Obviously don't expect some 'star' hotel type accommodation.. But its not bad at all..",Sandipan Manna,/Profile/smanna1729,,40
