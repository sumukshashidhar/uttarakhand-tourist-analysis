mandi,"I stayed here for one night during my ride across Himachal Pradesh. Found this place when I was exploring stay options inside the village. The hotel has parking space beside the building. Rooms are on the second floor and might be a challenge for someone with knee problems or travelling with senior citizens. The rooms are newly constructed and are well maintained, hot water is available all through the day. Wifi was up and running seamlessly. Cant ask for more at this price. Did not eat here so cant comment on the food. Great place for an overnight stay.",Vishwas123,/Profile/Vishwas123,"Bengaluru, India",40
