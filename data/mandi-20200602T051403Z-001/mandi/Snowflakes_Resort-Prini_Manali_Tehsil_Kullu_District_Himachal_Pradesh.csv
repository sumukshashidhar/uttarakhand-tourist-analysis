We travelled in group and booked 8 honeymoon suites but the hotel staff gave us only 2 of them and rest  6 where lesser category rooms I.e.super deluxe.when we inquire with them they say that the same are honeymoon suite and not super deluxe.you will not find any difference in room categories. But the fact is they are just super deluxe.you have to end up paying more for rooms.   Rooms are medium sized.we have to call numerous times at reception for hot water as they turn off the hot water and also the water pressure in taps is very less, when we ask them they switch on some pressure pump then we get water.

To add up to that the facilities at the hotel, the calm and quite atmosphere and the location and view it offers is very good. Least to say is the amazing delicacies it offers in terms of taste and variety.  The owners of the hotel are also around and are also very much approachable. Infact they also suggested us on some of the local spots in the vicinity.

The view from the river facing rooms are beautiful and the rooms are large and comforting. The wood overtones also make it quite cosy. We had a balcony in our room but it was too cold for us to use. However, in the summer, I imagine it would be a beautiful place to relax on lazy afternoons. The in room dining food was disappointing but the breakfast spread was nice. As is very common in Manali, the service was always delivered with a smile. I think this resort comes into its own during the peak season so it might be an option if visiting during that time.
