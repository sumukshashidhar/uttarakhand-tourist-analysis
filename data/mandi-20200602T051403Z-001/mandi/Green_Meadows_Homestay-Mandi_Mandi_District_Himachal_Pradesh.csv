mandi,"We had booked this homsestay for two nights. We had never been to Janjehli which is 70-80 kms from main Bilaspur-Manali highway before reaching Mandi. It was easy to locate as Homestay owner guided us efficiently. You can also find this place on Google maps so it will be easy to locate and drive. Drive up to Janjehli doesn't have many potholes. And drive is very scenic. Homestay is budget friendly and it has simple and basic rooms with nice beds and small LED screen and attached bathrooms are clean and big. Geysers are also provided. Even in the month of April, we felt cold there. Food is homely and tasty. You can also ask for any local dishes like Siddu and it was delicious.

mandi,"We had been to this beautiful little village called Janjheli, which is also a base to visit Shikari Mata temple.  The home stay is run by a family who are very friendly and it is surrounded by the apple orchids. The rooms are very clean and well maintained.  All rooms have a beautiful view of mountains and lush green meadows. The food is very homely and made with lot of care. We got to eat good parathas, locally grown aloo, cauliflower, Rajma subji and offcourse a lot of apples. We stayed here for 2 nights, 3 days. We visited Shikari mata on day one and rest we enjoyed exploring the village through small hikes around the village, interacting with warm and welcoming native villagers, who also offered a lot of apples from their farm. Prakash who runs this homestay is very helpful.",Neha Jain,/Profile/NehaJain08,,50
