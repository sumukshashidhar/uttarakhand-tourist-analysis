mandi,"Just a short taxi ride from the railway station, for the toy train to Pathenkot.   Being three males travelling together, we booked  a twin plus extra bed but turned out to be a double bed with a mattress on the floor.   So this was changed to three separate double-bedded rooms, still at a reasonable price.   Corridors are open to the elements, so very cold in January without any heating in the hotel. But the beds were warm enough with good thick blankets and really warm showers.   Excellent restaurant, but again, no heating.
