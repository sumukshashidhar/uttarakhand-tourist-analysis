Its Trilokinath Temple is of 16th Century. Generally old towns have good eating joints (the so called dhabas etc), but surprisingly Mandi has none. Had to return to the hotel for our dinner and it was OK. Munish resort’s location on the hill top gives a good view of open Valley but River Beas is hardly visible. Even from 2nd floor rooms, slightly better river view you get does not justify extra 1000/ for 2 rooms set demanded for it Down below the view is mainly of haphazard growth of Manali township Midnight due to AC malfunctioning had to switch it off and open the balcony door and window and it was quite pleasant.
