mandi,"Don't believe what they are saying in the web site.  This hotel is the middle of the forest  ten KM away from the border of the town. Swan tours New Delhi is the one cheated us to put this hotel. Even the season they don't have any guest except us. Swan Tours New Delhi promised us a four star type hotel and they charged for that.  But Swan tours provided this hotel which don't have even a good restaurant. They offered us a free break fast and dinner, but there is chappathy and dal for us always.  They didn't provided anything.  Me and my family had a very bad time  with these people.  On night they locked our rooms from out side.  When we inquired, they said it is our safety.  I don't know may be they are thinking we will run away from that dirty hotel.",Thilak V,/Profile/673thilakv,Bangalore,10
