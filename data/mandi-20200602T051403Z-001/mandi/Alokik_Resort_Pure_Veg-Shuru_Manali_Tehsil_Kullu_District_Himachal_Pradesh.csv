mandi,"This is a new Hotel so there are some rough edges. Our room on the ground floor with a balcony overlooking the river was nice and clean. The room was specious and well appointed. The wooden floor, however, was dusty and rough. The sleep quality was reasonably good. Being a pure vegetarian hotel it had very few choices in the breakfast. The dinning area offers a very good view of the river though. The staff were nice and friendly and overall I would say we had a good experience. We paid around 7K for one night's stay which I felt was a bit overpriced.",samaljn,/Profile/samaljn,"New Delhi, India",40
mandi,"Overall the experience was very good. Location and view was marvellous.Interiors of the Hotel was excellent. The best part was that it was 5 km before Manali, so there was no hassle of main manali traffic jam, while on arrival and departure. Service  still needs improvement. Buffet dinner should include more varieties and also chinese dishes, as it satisfies childrens lust.",CosmosPurifiers,/Profile/CosmosPurifiers,"New Delhi, India",50
mandi,"The fantastical thing was this resort has pool and bonfire next to each other, in case we get into a little cold water. Kids play zone right there near garden. I can see my kids from the pool. Garden is great. The entire family loved activities and the clean posh rooms like no other resort. Restuarant serves great food. Thanks to the cook and especially housekeeping.",Tejash P,/Profile/tejashp147,,50

mandi,Hotel is located outside Manali town.there is no pick up and drop facility which management should take very seriously.this will definately delight customers staying at Alokik. Food quality I can say is extra ordinary.good vegetarian food is available at hotel.Bar and non veg is not available. Overall good hotel to stay if you check-in with your vehicle in Manali.,sachin p,/Profile/sachinp1399,,40

mandi,"Its a pure vegetarian hotel which is still lacking few amenities & has management issues. I stayed for 2 nts in Panaromic Chalet room. There was no mini fridge & a locker for valuables. House keeping didnt pick up my phone when I called at 7 in the morning. No billing clerk before 8 am. Hence if you want to check out early, pay bills a night before. No tandoor in kitchen. No separate dry & wet areas in bathroom. Even with full staff, check-out was pathetic. Hopefully owners will take my feedback as constructive & positive. No feedback forms  at hotel which is a must for an upcoming hotel. But the owners have invested heavily in the project & all amenities are brand new. For international travellers non veg will be a big miss. Not even egg preparations. Breakfast was average.",umeshjain,/Profile/umeshjain,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30

I stayed from 25th Dec to 3rd January along with my family and we all enjoyed a lot,AmanJuneja3012,/Profile/AmanJuneja3012,"New Delhi, India",50
mandi,"I visited the resort and found it very attractive with full amneties. Spacious rooms were great to stay with family. located at the peaceful place, in its surroundings, two or three resorts are also available but in comparison found it the best in any terms.  Food was also brilliant which always remains the very important part of any trip. Very supportive staff makes ur trip easier and relaxed.  The main point was spacious parking which I think in its nearby, no resorts have which makes this resort more lucrative.   I would definitely love to stay again in this resort.",Anurag Y,/Profile/950anuragy,,50
