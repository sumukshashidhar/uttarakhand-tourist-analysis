mandi,I had 2 bookings done for this hotel in May and for a personal emergency reason i had to cancel my stay there. One of the booking was cancelled on the same day as stay and the other was cancelled 4 days prior to stay. Unfortunately the hotel has refused to pay my money back. Not even one rupee they paid back citing their non refundable cancellation rules.  Considering it was a peak season in manali the hotel would have anyway filled their rooms and earned double profits. I wish the management was empathetic and refund atleast part of the money as i really lost 22k of my hard earned money and it has been a huge loss to me. Since I have not stayed there i would not give any other feedback but all i know is management is quite rude and they are not ready to help.,Pallavi,/Profile/744pallavir,,10

Negative points:  We had hot water issue as they have common boiler for whole property so it took about 1h to get hot water. We called many times the reception and finally they came to solve the problem. Restaurant is in basement which has no charm (compared to rooms), it's kind of suffocated place where we can't really enjoy the food. Specifically when they cook or fry something it becomes very smoky. Rooms are beautiful but the restaurant is the most negative thing of this hotel.

The menu states that they would levy service charge but when we received our bill, it was stated , ""service charge with guest content "". They did not even ask us for the same nor took our consent for the service charges which were levied in our food bills. This was a total disappointment.  Moreover, every room has a balcony but the controls of the balcony lights are with the management and not in the guest room. They switch off all the lights at one go at 22:00hrs. So if you wanna spend time outside sitting by the balcony, be ready to face the darkness by the mentioned time. They should have the light controls in the room.",Shamika C,/Profile/934shamikac,"Mumbai, India",40

Can't really think if anything better to say about the place, except that the room service and F&B staff were decent.   Negatives:   1. The claim to be a so called ""Resort"" but they don't have AC in the rooms. Due to this, if it gets cold, you'll have to ""borrow"" the heater for 300 bucks, which is nothing but extortion.   2. Definition of Day-light robbery: They charge you for drinking water!! Yes! Water bottles don't come as complimentary in the package. Instead, when we ask for water bottles, they charge a premium INR 30/- (so called ""resort"" price) + service charge + taxes. Seriously? Service charge for water bottle?

The hotel is understaffed and they need to add either central heating or provide heaters complimentary for the cold weather in manali. The heater costs Rs. 400 additional. Make sure you don't get stuck with the people at the manali toll entry as they'll try to show you some hotels to make there commission.

Although they claim to be best hotel of manali but they did not provide even hot air blower, you have to pay extra for this , as you know manali is very cold place, they should provide it free of cost.  Other major problem of this hotel is frequent tripping of power supply at about 10 to 15 times in a day, each about for 5 to 10 minutes.  Quality of food in this hotel is average.

Separate heaters are available for Rs 400 per day, which I feel is cheating the customers.

mandi,Booked the hotel through holiday package. We Were told its 4 star. Sorry sir please see a 4 star to decide how it is supposed to be. Small rooms. Hotel is located in a residential colony surrounded with houses. No view. No professionalism. In dinner we had  a single non veg dish. In the maje of dessert it was red boondiüòìüòì. Was supposed to have a stay for 3 days with a tariff of 12000 per day  but moved out in one day. It is worth paying only 2500 as per its present standards. Probably due to summer rush they thought they will earn some money. Sorry for the harsh words but i cannot see others getting cheated like this.  Trust me. Not the place to be in manali.,Sudeep9_9,/Profile/Sudeep9_9,"Jaipur, India",10

mandi,Travelled for our 3rd Marraige Anniversary from 6th July to 9th July.Booked an Honeymoon Suit.One of the Good Hotel in Manali.But has both Cons and Pros. Pros: Pickup and Drop sevice was good. Food was clean and hygenic and tasty. (can be improved by adding more options to the menu). Hotel cleanliness is well maintained. Room Service was Quick. Hotel Ambience is very good.  Cons: Front office people need to improve their behavior towards Guest.They mindset is like somewhat guests Come and Go Why should we bother so much. When we reach the hotel it was raining heavily and we both were drenched.But these people did'nt have the courtesy to atleast provide us with towel and did'nt even tell us to have our seats.

The balcony view of river and mountain view towards Rohtang pass in the back of hotel were really amazing. The room charges seems to be worth of spending money here. Excellent hospitality, staff were really co-operative and in fact, they had sincerely put their efforts to search for the accessories I forgot in the room and couriered them to me at free of cost. They helped in planning my short duration trip with good suggestions. I look forward to stay here in my next trip.

mandi,The hotel is nicely located.  One characteristic of this place is that there are different configuration for a category of room i.e. ( I booked online) If you book a type of room then you may not get the room as pictured. I book the rooms online and i learned that this also happens but only in non standard hotels like this. The food quality is good but front office is little argumentative if you have already paid. The rooms are decent but again one has to choose the rooms. Last but not the least spot bargaing is prevalent.,Shashank K,/Profile/Shank111,"Singapore, Singapore",30
mandi,I stayed at the hotel from15 Nov 2010 to 18 Nov 2010. The hotel is located at a very beautiful location and from the balcony of the rooms one can see the mountains claded with snow. The hotel also has an extremely tasty food served at the hotel restaurant called the DAWAT. It also has an open air restaurant and a discotheque and a wine bar. Stay at the hotel was pleasant and the hotel staff was also too coopearative. Overall an excellent hotel and highly recommended for stay at manali.,mukeshpadwal,/Profile/mukeshpadwal,mumbai,50

At first look look simple sweet and quit. it had a cute little garden having chairs, and 2 swings, one can enjoy the beautiful view of mountain  here.  We stay there for 4 nights and go for sight seeing/ skiing/ and other activity in morning  and use to have a small walk on cute and colorful streets of mall road before having our dinner. on the whole the place becomes too good when you enjoy  outdoor activities collect too many memories and when you return back to hotel it hugs you with its coziness to give you the comfort you needed to get fresh for the next day.

But when we went there, shocking there were no rooms kept for us. We were asked to stay in a rather low quality Hotel named Hotel Comfort Inn right next to the main hotel. In the arguement that followed The Manager Mr.Ankush Bharadwaj assaulted us physically and also beat the cleaner of our van. By then it was 12 midnight and it took us three hours in the terrific Manali Cold to find another accommodation. We were travelling with ladies and a small child and were left stranded by this hotel.
