mandi,"It was my first visit to Manali with my family. We stayed for two days and two nights. Awesome place, familiar approach, courteous & friendly reception, excellent food amidst the bounty nature of Manali. The dazzling snow caped mountain, lush green foliage and the cool calm nature all can be seen from room itself. We enjoyed  very much. Though vegetarian, food was very much tasty and a variety of items were served. Candle light dinner and the buffet breakfast and dinner also add extra grandeur. Central heating and cleanliness round the clock is praiseworthy. The garden outside and the indoor activities was joyful to us. This is a perfect location to spend holidays.

Amazingly helpful with pick up and checkin:  Lemme simply share my own experiences with you. I reached resort late at night. Around 2 am. It was snowing all around. Roads had been blocked. Many people were stranded on the road. We kept on calling the resort and they kept on assuring us to come as near as possible via taxi and they would come and pick us up. They responded all through the night on phone. Once we reached market, it was all too snowy for the car to go any further. But like promised, the resort then sent thr jeep along with heater to pick us up. I mean.. Mind blowing.. So grateful.. Then once we reached the",puneet_rider,/Profile/puneet_rider,"Pune, India",50

mandi," Stayed here with my family from 9-12th March 2020.   I had booked this hotel after reading its reviews on MMT and trip advisor. Many had written that it’s like a small 5 star hotel. I can now say, I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THIS LINE.   The room (312) was as promised with beautiful view of mountains. It was spacious with decent place after an extra mattress.  Centrally AC / heating worked well and kept us warm all the time. We were lucky to experience snow (bit more on that later)  Staff was very courteous.  Overall aesthetics were excellent.   Small small things that they take care of were really commendable and speak volumes about them and our overall experience. For eg - 1) Extra mattress as good as a bed. 2) the breads (rotis) are never kept ready on the table when they serve",KapilBavad,/Profile/Kapilbavad,"Mumbai, India",50

mandi,I stayed two hotels in Manali in last few days and this one was best.  Room was big and spacious but unfortunately as I was very late to book the room I didn't find their best one . So view from the room was average.  The staffs were very good and happy facing and we'll behaved .  Property location is excellent. View from outside lawn was awesome though it was too cold to enjoy for longer duration. My kid found the place to be very good as it got a kid friendly indoor and outdoor facilities. The hotel's restaurant is complete vegetarian and that's a minus point for us . However food was delicious. ,mehedi01558,/Profile/mehedi01558,"Sylhet Division, Bangladesh",50

But their staff did an exceptional job in maintaining the service.   A very important thing to note is, that this is a family place, no loud music or parties, and they serve Veg Only.

If you are visiting Manali, and this hotel is in your budget, go for it eyes closed, and you will really get the best possible experience out of your stay.  Location: It undoubtedly sits at the best location in Manali because it is on top of the Log huts road which makes it very calm and secluded, away from the noise, crowds and traffic of Manali town.

""Resort"" in the title is a bit of a misnomer; the atmosphere inside  is one of an ok business hotel. The ""grounds"" in the front, if they can be called that, are pretty small.  We stayed in a duplex room. It was good and had nice views. Nothing particularly impressive about the food either. It is located upcountry in a somewhat secluded spot away from downtown; the remoteness is an advantage if you prefer to stay peacefully indoors (you'dn't want to because it really is not a resort), a disadvantage otherwise especially if you don't have a car.

The location is great, food is vegetarian and good, its slightly away from Manali market but that was fine for us, the facilities are bare minimum but sufficient for people, the staff is cordial, lawn is good for relaxing under the sun. The only thing I would rate the hotel negative is the buffet spread. On that count the resort can be termed as slightly over priced, because the buffet spread in bfast/dinner lacks variety , and if u stay beyond 2-3 days, u get to eat the same menu again and again.
