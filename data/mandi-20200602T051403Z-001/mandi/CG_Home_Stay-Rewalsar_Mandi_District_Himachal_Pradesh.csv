mandi,"I am deeply grateful to the CG Family for the wonderful days I spent at their home in Rewalsa. No doubt, the best choice I could have done! Thank you, Geeta and Mr Thakur for your beautiful hospitality, warmth and generosity. You made me feel at home and so well taken care. Thank you to your son, Narain, for all the messages ensuring that everything was going well and anything I needed was provided. I had a great time at your homestay! My room was lovely, full of light, very clean and comfortable. The living room was great to relax and eat the most delicious and nourishing homemade meals Geeta made for me every day. The organic gardens surrounding the house were beautiful and productive and the Roof Top was the perfect place for a morning yoga practice with a view to the",Eunice Neves,/Profile/241eunice_neves,,50

mandi,"This is not a hotel. It is home.  Narian and his mother-in-law Geeta made sure we felt as  guests at their home. They shared their food with us, set with us and talked, gave us great tips about the area and helped us when we needed help. Overall, they made us feel welcomed, more than any other place we satyed in while in India.   You have the option to eat breakfast and dinner their. Simple, home made and delicious food.   Since the home is in the village -  and not on the lake near the concentration of all the guesthouses - it is a little bit difficlut to find. but it is worth the search.   Overall, highly recommended!",Michalm,/Profile/michalmitr,,50
mandi,"Make no mistake! We have stayed in around a hundred different places in India during our 10+ months travelling this glorious country and we both firmly believe that c g home stay is THE BEST. My wife and I were thoroughly impressed.  Every single detail was thought of and auntie geeta and husband were eager to make our stay as comfortable as possible. We felt at home from the moment that we arrived. It was like going to stay with our own family.  The food provided is not your usual dhaba style food - it is lovingly prepared home cooking style, and if you have the time, I'm sure that Geeta would love to show you how to cook. If only we could learn her recipe for her chutneys, we could make a fortune selling them in England because they are divine.  There is a beautiful roof top",Carl E,/Profile/melvinon6,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",50
mandi,"My son & I stayed with Geeta at her family home.  It was lovely to stay in a family home, with home cooking.  Very comfortable & well looked after.  Plus a great affordable price.  The location is excellent, being away from the noise of the main town, yet close enough to walk to the lake in 10 minutes.",Tim Blanc,/Profile/ZenCook,,50

mandi,"It was a really lovely and a beautiful family, I can say have made with the family running the homestay, Narainji is one of the best people I have met in my life, had come with a broken, and went back with a healed heart, aunty fed some lovely food, spoke to them the whole night about life & Rewalsar, if any one is even close to Mandi should for sure go to C.G homestay. Amazing place.",Varun K,/Profile/VarunK505,,50
mandi,"We are an English couple travelling around India and happened to stumble upon Naraian's family home. We only booked one night but kept extending our stay due to the amazing atmosphere provided. The home cooked food was delicious, the bedrooms spacious and clean, a beautiful garden with their freshly grown fruits and veg. We felt totally welcomed into their home, but also had the downstairs area to ourselves, so felt able to spend time alone as well. We had not heard of the specific location of Rewalar before staying, but we are so glad that we discovered this little beauty. Next to rewalsar lake, the stunning monastery, spot some monkeys, and an easy bus ride away to the temple caves. Even without any of the above in the area we would have stayed just for the incredible company.",Mobile829168,/Profile/Mobile829168,,50

Located in a good spot, within easy walking distance to the lake, we would recommend CG Home Stay to others.  Narain regaled us with interesting experiences and stories making us feel very welcome.  The food was prepared and presented with love and the garden provides a peaceful retreat.  We were surprised and delighted with a birthday cake and a personal gift on leaving.

But what really sets this place apart was the family. We were treated as though we were long lost relatives with stories, laughs and photos. We were given gifts and delicious home made produce.

mandi,"This is a great place to stop in Rawalsar! Clean rooms, delicious homemade food, hot water in shower, quiet and peaceful place. The owner gave us all the information about the sights. He is very pleasant in communication. The only thing that surprised me was the price, which was slightly different than we expected. It seemed to me that the owner is not very serious about the price that he indicated on booking.com. It seems he does not yet understand that people are more serious about this :) But we solved the problem in an amicable way. Narayana please, for the future, indicate the full price for everything: living, service etc. In this case your customers will know the total price in advance and will be able to plan their expenses. I want to note that this fact did not spoil",Boris D,/Profile/borisd801,"Moscow, Russia",40
mandi,"Don’t miss out on this homestay if you are near Mandi area. It takes an hour on the bus from Mandi but it is well worth it to visit Rawalsar as it is far prettier, quieter and more interestingness things to do.  You will stay in a lovely family home, situated with a beautiful shaded garden that grows curry leaves, mangos and more - which makes it smell lovely. There are some resident mongoose who hang around as well which is exciting to see if you like nature. The rooftop was a favourite place in  the morning as you can see right down th valley if it’s clear or gaze up at the mountains, also great for bird watching. The best bit of the stay though is the people! All members of the family are warm and kind people. Narain especially was always making sure we were comfortable and",Mud m,/Profile/Mudm12,,50
mandi,"If you're looking for a warm welcome in Rewalsar from a friendly accommodating family you won't be disappointed with CG homestay. The room was simple and clean, as was the separate bathroom. Filtered drinking water was supplied too. The location is really convenient and close to the temple plus the hike up to the hillside caves. If you want to book your accommodation in advance this is a decent option.  One cautionary note, which I feel is only fair to bring to the attention of budget-minded travelers, is that we found that our bill was significantly higher than we expected due the inclusion of some unexpected items.  When we reviewed the booking dot com details its easy to see where this confusion came from. There's no mention of the 'service charge' plus various items are",Simon,/Profile/thebritstralian,"Melbourne, Australia",30

Ask about their gardens!     The place did not have wifi but the family allowed us to use their phone as a hot spot mornings and evenings. NOTE: we found only ONE place with wifi in this small city (Community Restaurant) so the family providing a hot spot was nice. We looked/we asked, wifi just is not seen as important here.    The lake is only 800 meters around (per travel guides) so it's a nice daily walk. Temples abound and plenty of parks to sit and relax. ",Allen A,/Profile/sailboatravler,Michigan,40

The family living here are the most open hearted and sincere people we have lived with in our 3 month stay in India.   The room was neat and clean and since we mostly had the whole groundfloor to ourselves (most visitors only stayed one night), we had two bathroom's (one western and one Indian), two big living rooms and the most lovely garden for the cost of one room.   The food was the best we have tasted and most of the ingredients were from their own garden, so tasty and fresh. Our child at nine got food free of charge and they cooked special baby food for our little one, also for free. There was clean water from",mikkelmar85,/Profile/mikkelmar85,"Copenhagen, Denmark",50

Tucked away in a quiet bit of the village was this beautiful home stay. The garden was teeming with flowers and had we been a little later mangoes and pears too!  All this and still just a short walk from the main street and the temples. A very lovely, gracious family who even invited us to meet their beautiful new granddaughter! The food was delicious home cooking, much better than any of the paying restaurants around. I left with a very happy feeling and a full stomach!",Gussie P,/Profile/gussiep2016,,50
