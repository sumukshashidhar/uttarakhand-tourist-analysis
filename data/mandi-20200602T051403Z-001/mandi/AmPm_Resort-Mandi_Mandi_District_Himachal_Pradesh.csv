mandi,"We stopped here for lunch after reading good reviews. Given that we were travelling with a baby we wanted a hygienic place. We chose to sit outside as there was a lovely view of the river. But just behind us, within the property, there was garbage being burnt. We went in and did not like what we saw. There was an old, dirty, dysfunctional billiards table. There were flies. We regretted that we had ordered some food. The food came: fried rice, nimbu pani and hot chocolate. Everything was below standard. We did not eat the food and left. There were two people who served us. One was a young boy, and the other a man who worked in the kitchen. They told us that the owners were not around. When we left we saw that a man was waving at cars, just like in dhabas, trying to get customers.",Moorlessmigrant,/Profile/Moorlessmigrant,"New Delhi, India",20
mandi,It's a decent place with decent pricing. It's before Aut well suited for a night Haul. Good place to spend relaxing evening. The cottage is fine for the price. Restaurant is good with nice overall vibe. Definitely a PM place rather than AM :),SadakChaap,/Profile/SadakChaap,"New Delhi, India",40
