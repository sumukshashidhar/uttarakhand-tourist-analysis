mandi,"I Stay at hotel Wangdu Rewalsar for 4 nights on my firs ever visit here and can say had an excellent stay.  Nice clean room, good honest manager and staff.  Breakfast and dinner was great but must be ordered in advance.  The location is further away from lake, which may not be suitable for all but ideal if you want a good night's sleep   Highly recommended",Jay,/Profile/Jaysavani12,,50
