mandi,We visited the wildflower hall for three days stay inJanuary 2020... we are a family of four with two kids - 8 & 4 years old. It started snowing as we neared our hotel. My first snow experience and it was magical... the resort was amazing dressed in white. We booked a mountain view room and the room was really cosy and comfortable. The view from our room was breathtaking. The hospitality and food was really good. We enjoyed the hot water jacuzzi while it was snowing.. the kids had fun playing in the snow. The staff were very friendly and efficient. We will definitely come back again.,Savitha M,/Profile/savitha1988,,50

In true Christmas spirit almost everyone gathered for the Carol singing. We all sat excitedly with Santa caps and sipped on warm Muddled Wine or hot chocolate while the in house staff sang with glee. They gave us the lyrics to sing along and children went up to sing in the choir. At turndown, they left Christmas cookies filled in a Santa sock hung at each door.

The most memorable experience was having the barbeque treats at the live counter in the garden area when the temperature was -2°C and we merrily enjoyed standing",Talatis,/Profile/talatis,"Mumbai, India",50

Very rude staff with fake smile. 1) Duty manager miss poornima is very rude and doesnt know how to handle such nice Property. 2) Food quality is below par. We found stray of hair in the pizza which we ordered  At the restaurant and after complaining they were very casual about this blunder. 3) outdoor jacuzzi is an outstanding experience. 4) All the staff at the restaurant are very rude.  5) buffet spread is very poor. Its like any 3 star property. 6) rooms are outdated and very small.   Overall a poor experience after spending 25k-30k per night.

The hotel is beautiful and utterly decadent - I loved just sitting in the bar area of an afternoon with my book and a Kingfisher. The infinity whirlpool is one of the highlights. It is an expensive place to stay but worth every penny - only gripe was the lack of decent internet but really this wasn't a problem. The staff were amazing and so kind to us - especially with our final meal in the private dining room. We  hope to come back some day.

Vinod, Akshay  (restaurant )and Pawan (cook) require special mention. A stay of three - four nights is adequate as there would not be much activity around. However two issues 1. their activity desk does need some improvement with the personnel manning the desk to come with ideas other than picnics on treks! There are several interesting places for outings for visits around Simla which can be recommended but were not. 2. Limited free wifi of only 30 minutes a day is inadequate However as this was a purely leisure trip no complaints.

Shimla is not an easy place to reach since there is no direct air-connectivity anymore. The nearest landing point is Delhi or Chandigarh, and the best way to get to Shimla from Chandigarh is by road. Once you go through the 4-hour ordeal on the road, the final destination you reach is worth the effort. Ensure that you pre-book your cab before you reach Chandigarh and decide the rate to and fro in advance to save haggling later.

Its location is top-notch, set on a mountainside with beautiful panoramic views (which, alas, were a bit hazy when I visited) of the Himalayas in the distance.  Far from hearing any noise from the road below, I was amazed at the feeling of seclusion, aided by the 100+ yard steep driveway that separates the hotel from the tiny town below.  There are a few disappointments, to be sure: the outside jacuzzi, its incredible perch notwithstanding, was showing its age and the adjacent area was under repair with a unsightly board blocking some of the views. And I agree that the food was a bit hit-or-miss (the thai dish was actually more impressive than the",drex,/Profile/drex,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",40
mandi,"I have to say that I'm a bit surprised by some of the less than stellar reviews for the Wildflower.  I stayed there in December last year and had quite the most amazing time - the views are amazing, especially from the not tiny terrace and outdoor hot tub (note that it's a hot tub, not a pool).  Check out some of my photos on flickr - tagged with wildflower ad shimla to get an idea of the place.  Service was delivered with a smile and was always excellent..mind you...I'I find that being nice (and remembering that hotel staff are human beings) generally means that you get treated well.   Went swimming, had a couple of massages, went hiking (with a delicious if slightly odd packed lunch prepared by the hotel) and mountain biking. The hotel provides a guide for the biking, and he",urbanjunkie,/Profile/urbanjunkie,london,50
mandi,"Unfortunately we find ourselves in the minority of opinion concerning Wildflower Hall. Our expectations from a five star resort hotel are intuitive service, exceptional food and an idyllic location. This hotel comprehensively failed to meet those expectations. The experience was very disappointing for a number of reasons:   Primarily the food was not up to standard. We were served two mediocre meals at dinner on the first two nights of our stay, including overcooked white fish and rancid prawns. Having complained we were afforded the special attention of the executive chef and the food on our third night was good, but only as good as it should have been in this most expensive of Indian hotels. Service at breakfast fell apart as soon as the restaurant became moderately busy. ",WillJMitchell,/Profile/WillJMitchell,London,10
mandi,"It was great to arrive and get away from the heat of Delhi but was disappointed with the overall experience.  Stayed 4 nights and there was very little to do from 6PM onwards, dinner in the same restaurant every night (food was very good) but would have preferred more variety.  Activities were good during the day but you had to drive for miles to get there on some very hairy roads. Best bits: yoga in the morning, golf at the craziest course ever!  Also had money stolen from purse (but I did not put it in the safe so I only have myself to blame!)  Photos of the hotel are very flattering, the infinity pool & terrace were tiny.  Overall it was OK - but I wouldn't say it was fantastic, had better experiences elsewhere. ",Nurette,/Profile/Nurette,"London, United Kingdom",20
mandi,"In addition to other reviews, I am in total agreement that this is an outstanding place to stay, one of the main reasons being the spectacular views.  There was no fault in the booking, welcome, handling of check-in/check-out and general comfort.  There was some slight annoyance with waiting staff - we paid for lunchtime tea out on the balcony, and told them we would wait in the main lounge for our change whilst spa staff came up to take our treatment bookings.  We never saw them or our money until we asked for it (30 minutes later).  Also, whilst they were very attentive during their service of the meal, when a larger group of people came through, the staff all flapped and concentrated on them, leaving my sister and I somewhat bemused as to why it takes 4 waiters to serve 5",LondonRad.,/Profile/londonrad,London,40
mandi,"We had very high expectations of the Wildflower Hall, and my wife and I were absolutely pleased that the Wildflower exceeded every one of them. What caught our eye were the pictures on the Wildflower website, for example, the indoor pool area, the terrace and rooms overlooking the Himalayas, and the real experience was certainly much better than the already fabulous impression that the photos conveyed. Several reviewers have talked about the great service, the stunning and breathtaking snow-capped mountain scenery from the rooms (request for the mountain view rooms), the spa (by Banyan Tree) and so on, and we absolutely agree. Their Indian selection at the restaurant was marvellous too. Their Himalayan Adventure Package was certainly very good value for the money we paid, as it",WLeong,/Profile/WLeong,Singapore,50

The guard stands to attention and salutes you, you them get a glimpse of the hotel, but even better you get a breathtaking view of the Himalayas.  The welcome was superb and you are taken straight to your room to check in - how fab is that!  We had a room with a terrace overlooking the Himalayas which was stunning.  But my best part of our stay was having a massage and then finishing it off with a rose petal bath, which looked out over the stunning mountain view.  What pampering, what heaven!

The room itself is very nicely decorated.  There are lots of activities to do, including morning yoga on the grass hilltop (amazing views), horseback riding, and hiking.  The spa massages were incredible (again, rooms with amazing views).  But probably the most amazing part of this hotel is its outdoor jacuzzi: large, blue-tiled, and with an infinity-point side looking out to the Himalayas.  The best jacuzzi we have ever seen in our lives.  The food was only average, but good if you honed in on the local trout and apples.

The hour and a half flight from Delhi to Shimla is, granted a bit on the Indiana Jones side, but as soon as you arrive in Shimla airport you will realise it is completely worthwhile.   The hotel provided transfers and the drive took around 90 minutes and in itself was highly entertaining. As soon as you check in you realise that this hotel has real character. We were lucky enough to get a room with a terrace to enjoy the spectacular view.   The hotel food and service was excellent and eating breakfast on the terrace overlooking the mountains is an excellent way to start the day.

Well dressed, healthy-looking populace, incredible mountain views, cedar forests, clean air, great food.  Wildflower Hall (which is an Oberoi resort,) had the usual flawless Oberoi service, the best food I ate in India, and marvelous mountain views. Loved the hardwood floors in my room, and great fun attending yoga classes and nature hikes in the adjacent protected forest.   Beautiful spa - I had an Indonesian spice body wrap - the smell made me hungry!  The hotel has a super general manager - very friendly and professional.   All in all, I recommend this property highly, and although it is a bit difficult getting to Shimla, I think",DancingGal,/Profile/DancingGal,"Salt Lake City, Utah",50

Only detraction is isolation.  Takes 45mins to drive to Shimla and costs Rs3000 for 4hours ($75) - you wander while the driver will pick you up later.  Although there is an Oberoi in Shimla, there is no coutesy facility to combine the two for a shopping/lunch trip.  If you want privacy, getting away from it all and outdoor activities - this is the place.  We had a great day river rafting and the Himalaya Adventure package is good value.

The staff are very friendly and there wasn't a single staff member that we passed and did not smile and say hello.   The choice and quality of food is on par with expectations although we didn't find it 'mind blowing'. The menu changes everyday.  The outdoor jacuzzi is also fab and you get a very good view of the surrounding mountains / hills when the weather is clear.   There are a number of trails you can go on, all of which are clearly described in a brochure. Note that the moderate and hard trails require you to go with a Guide which cost us 500 INR per hour.
