Decorations of walls and floors is achieved using natural colours of a variety of woods etc. - and the results are stunning. The staff were friendly and efficient while the owners took a personal interest in their paying guests and were happy to chat. Being in the location it is, it is not surprising that the vast majority of the guests are likely to be agile. It must be admitted that the top floor restaurant - only accessed via steps - did present its difficulties for a couple of less agile octogenarians.

mandi,"Awesome retreat - Shivadya was one of our best .  Nestled  in the valley away from the hustle bustle of Manali in Karjan village 13Km away from Manali Mall road is one of the finest resorts we ever came through. The resort reflects old Himachal style wooden architecture  with all the modern amenities.  Hospitality is at its best and the staff is amazing, the food served at the restaurant is great , the chef’s servings are a treat. We were at the resort in the first week of Jan’17 and were lucky to have snowfall  at the resort itself. I highly recommend this resort  …. Thanks to Mr Ritesh (owner) , Amardeep  and team for making our stay a memorable experience.",zenithpals,/Profile/zenithpals,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50

Each room is unique and tastefully done in traditional Himachali architectural style of the region. They have been able to achieve  a perfect blend of simplicity and luxury. The best part of the stay is the experience you are provided by the team, led by the owner himself...guided walks with picnic baskets, information on local tradition & customs, including a peep into the kitchen where you can try your hand at cooking local delicacies...an experience in itself.

What a revelation ShivAdya is it is so many things first ecologically sound, the locals know more than a thing about construction, visually appealing. The rooms are top class  so to the amenities, the staff ever courteous to please, and the freedom of being able to decide what you want to eat as against a set menu. Lounge outside on the benches and become a sun worshiper, read a book or indulge in walks from a ramble to a trek. Indulge in adventure adrenaline rush and at the end of the day sink into the warm embrace of your mattress in a room warmed perfectly.

I always look for a place where I get a chance to connect with the culture of that particular region and Shivadya resorts is the place where I got a chance to experience the real Himachal under one roof. The architecture of this property was very tastefully done, the perfection at its best. It is inspired with the temple architecture of Himachal. The rooms were very large and based on the deferment themes, equipped with the all the amenities and luxury.  I tasted authentic Himachali food here.

It is an unexpected oasis of peace and tranquility, beautiful architecture, absolute comfort and extremely personable attention and hospitality. The owners oversaw and actively participated in the construction of the property. Only natural and locally sourced materials were used in its construction, making it an example of sustainable and culturally responsible development that should be emulated by all.

mandi,I should say the place is so serene that no resort or hotel may approach the theme of ShivAdaya. There are ample activities to do and Spa Steam Sauna Jacuzzi whatever you expect from a 5 Star boutique resort is provided by hospitable and down to earth staff. The owners are brain behind such a fantastic theme of this property and they have taken care of every detail in service and setting up the place.  A great place to feel culture of Himachal and to be cut from crowd and get lost in mesmerising nature. Just 100 meters from Kullu Naggar Karjan Manali Highway in popular Manali Himachal.  Vision is biggest thing. With due respect to Traditional Architecture and utilising skill of Craftsman it also needs a great effort and touch of Fine Art to make it to these fantastic levels.
