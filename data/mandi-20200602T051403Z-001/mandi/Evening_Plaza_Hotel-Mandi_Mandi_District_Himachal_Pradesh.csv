mandi,"This place checks off all the boxes.  Clean, cheap and centered in the middle of the city while being only 15 minutes from the bus station.  The front desk was very open and friendly (which I definitely appreciated).  Perfect for someone under a tighter budget in India.",NeoAxion,/Profile/NeoAxion,"Detroit, Michigan",40
mandi,Fair sized rooms at a reasonable price. Definitely look around the hotel at different options and prices for a quiet location or optional AC. We chose a room on the 2nd floor which was cooler (no AC) but had a fan in the ceiling and was away from the noise of the street. Our bathroom had hot water but we used a bucket which we did not mind. Second visit for one night we had a similar room but the bed contained crisps (sleeping bag liners used).,ScubaSteve453,/Profile/ScubaSteve453,"Swindon, United Kingdom",40
mandi,"Nice stay, affordable, clean. Hot water was only available in the morning and only in the bucket. Sad in jan when it's so cold outside. But free heater and lots of blankets. Staff was ok, we didn't ask much so I can't really say if they are helpful or not. Central location, near the market and the temple on the hill.",Pocureuil,/Profile/Pocureuil,Biel,30
