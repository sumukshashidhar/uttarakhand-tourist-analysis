mandi,"This is a budget hotel right beside the pilgrim circuit around Rewalsar Lake. The rooms with lake views were all full but at least we did not have to carry our bags upstairs. Our room cost Rs500 which was certainly fair value. We had two single beds together with moderately hard mattresses, clean sheets, plenty of blankets, a chair, a bedside table and an old style television that worked and had English channels. The wet-floor bathroom had it's own hot water service so we had a hot shower. The restaurant served Tibetan and other food including good momos. If you were looking for more up market/expensive accommodation you might try the HP Tourist Inn which is located just behind the Hotel Lotus Lake.",DaisyClover,/Profile/DaisyClover,"Melbourne, Australia",30

mandi,I visited Rewalsar during third week of May 2016 and it was pretty warm. The place is small like one of the areas in capital cities of India. Nothing much to do apart from looking at a big statue of a monk and lake. The place is calm and has a small zoo having exactly 8 animals which is enough for kids of age between 1-2 years.   Riwalsar has about 12 hotels where you can stay and Lotus is certainly one of the best ones. The hotel is clean and located very near to the lake. You can take walk and enjoy your stay. This is apt only for one night.   Food is average and also you wont get awesome food in entire Riwalsar. Monasteries are good and well maintained.   Overall a good experience.,manish d,/Profile/772manishd,,30

mandi,"We (two couples) stayed here on a prepaid tour where we paid 600Rs per room/per night for accommodation. Our driver (the owners nephew) became unwell so we stayed another night but the owner attempted to charge us the inflated price of 1200Rs per room/per night. A few people around town also mentioned the owner was an untrustworthy character. The rooms were clean and comfortable, the guest house is about 10 mins walk from the beautiful Rewalsar and just next to the giant Buddha and the path up to the cave temple.",MegSchki,/Profile/MegSchki,"Busselton, Australia",30
mandi,"Rewalsar is a little pilgrimage town and has some charm.  It was also a nice place to break a trip from Manali to Shimla.  There are just a small number of lodgings in Rewalsar and this was the best of the lot.  But that isn’t saying much.  Lotus Lake has a basic, institutional atmosphere and is only slightly depressing.  No food is included and I don’t think I would want what came out of the cooking area anyway.  There are a few nicer cafes around town.",Keith B,/Profile/KeithB05,"Largo, Florida",20
mandi,"Rewalsar is  a great offbeat destination and this hotel is in a fantastic location if you think of it.  Nestled right next to the Rewalsar Lake. But its an extreme budget property. If your okay to ignore the level of hygiene you can opt for this hotel.  Or I would suggest you spend a bit more and stay at the tourism hotel, which again is not exactly anything close to spectacular. Also, The dogs in the vicinity wont let you sleep, I remember waking up numerous times in the middle of the night.  So I would recommend this hotel if your on a budget and just have to just pass the night. Not other wise.",vgs14,/Profile/vgs14,"Mumbai, India",30
mandi,"Five of us spent a night here en route to Manali. The rooms cost us 700 R; one had two beds and one had three beds. The beds were comfortable and the pillows were soft. Towels and soap were provided on request. The hotel is right by the in a good position for exploring the town. Nearby is the Kora Cafe where we ate dinner (Indian - good) and breakfast (open from 8am.) There didn't seem to be a lot of other choices in town for eating. It's the end of the season so maybe things have closed down. Don't miss going up to the huge statue of Guru Rimpoche. The cave is a bit underwhelming, and the footprint, in a room higher up the hill, didn't convince me. (But I'm not a Buddhist, and was approaching these things as a tourist.) The drive is interesting, and the views are good.",Gill W,/Profile/NZGill,"New Plymouth, New Zealand",40
mandi,"This hotel is owned by a Tibetan monastery and run by lay people. The rate was 900 rupees and I am sure that can change. Rewalsar is a great sort of India get away trip as in get a bit away from India. I am sure it has its over crowded tourists moments. But this is a good stay, it is a larger than average room with the average amenities. The restaurant is good and reliable and given the location a good deal. Its comfortable, quiet and perfectly located. Most other options are in the monasteries, a couple of other small guest houses and maybe some home stay. This is easily the best among the choices for the short visit.  But, maybe the main thing is to put Rewalsar on your list. Oh, not a fault of the guest house, the sleep quality is very good, the howling dogs of Rewalsar a",Joe M,/Profile/TibetanPhotoProject,Fort Bragg,40

mandi,"lotus lake hotel is surrounded by lots of cheap eateries and very close to the lake. as previously said, there has been a change in the management and during our stay they were painting and renewing all their roooms. our room was good and spotless clean, with a comfortable double bed (NO bed bugs!), mosquito's net on the windows, TV and 24h running hot water. they also have a restaurant, but it was closed for renovation as well so we cannot say much...  overall it was a very good stay! -500rs onward-",ventoeanna,/Profile/ventoeanna,"Isola Vicentina, Italy",40
mandi,"A new manager was appointed this month, so perhaps the approach to guests changed from the last review. Me and my BF felt very welcomed in this nice hotel. Yes, some rooms are a bit grubby and dark. At the time of our arrival, we were the only guests and were given a spacious, bright room on the first floor with the view of the lake (rp. 700 without bargaining) and could not complain. The room was reasonably clean (for India :), including the bathroom and with a big comfortable bed (no bugs). What really made us feel good here was the lady who manages this place and her husband. I got sick a bit during my stay (not because of the place :) and she was very helpful, always ready with an advice. Her husband used to be a guide and now works as a secretary in one of the temples.

mandi,"The hotel is reviewed in the Lonely Planet India guide book as being well run and clean. I found neither to be true.  My room was dirty, more expensive than it was worth, and worst of all I was bitten all over by bed bugs in the night and woken up to screaming street dogs fighting.  I asked for a room change, was switched into another room without bugs, but in the morning the manager acted as if she had done me a favor by switching my room into one that normally would be more expensive.  I was upset, but she could care less. I would have not paid the full rate considering I was bitten up and couldn't sleep the night because of the dirtiness of the room, but she had already taken my money and refused to give me any refund, insisting that she had done me a favor by putting me in a",Leah B,/Profile/LeahB708,"Palampur, India",10
