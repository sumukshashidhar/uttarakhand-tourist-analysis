mandi,These ppl serve old and roaten food please don’t waste money n health. My idiot driver has a connection with this hotel so he took us to this place n we were the only customer there and they charge a lot for the food given which smells n tastes like 3-4days old. I suggest you all please don’t visit this place not even for the toilets it stinks n door has no lock,Naveen,/Profile/Staysafes,,10

mandi,"We were returning from Manali to Chandigarh and wanted to take break in between so that we don't drive for a long duration . That's what we landed up in Kannan Castle   KAnnan Castle is must stop for you if you love good food .  pros : One the highway  Neat and clean rooms  Economically good rate  Exceptionally good food  Superb hospitality by Mr Rana - its manager and its team   It's a eight room capacity motel with all the qualities of good hotel .  I tried South Indian and North Indian vegetarian dishes and they were all excellent and at par with best restaurants . Dosa ,idli , Upma  , Jeera rice and Missi roti were some of the dish I tried and I can commend it .  I am sure when I visit Manali I would stop here for one day again ",Navneet C,/Profile/Navneet_Chola,"Pune, India",50
