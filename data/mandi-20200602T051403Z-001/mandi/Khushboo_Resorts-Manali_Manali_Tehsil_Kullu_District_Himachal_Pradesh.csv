Second, Don't expect any great view from your room. Because the earlier hotels I stayed in Manali had great river view or hill view or great alpine vegetation. But due to heavy commercialisation as is the case with any hot tourist destination, this hotel is surrounded by more hotels and more constructions and you will get a minuscule view of mountain from your room. Third, All the sewage from the surrounding hotels will be seen along the road leading to the resort. Stinks a lot. I wonder why they cannot do something about that.

This #10 ranked hotel did not miss our sight, and straightaway I called the Hotel and made a direct booking for my family for 3N4D (ended up in 4N5D) - last week of Dec2013. A perfect place if one wants a ""homestay"" feel.  Lil' bit away from Mall road, (about 1.5 kms) but one will not regret having booked.  The duplex room, though small for big family of 4, is quite comfortable for short stay.  Amazing mountain views from the bed!! With curtains off the windows - with a morning cup of tea - beholding the golden sunrays gradually ascending the mountain top --- wow...what a place, Manali is !!  Breakfast and Dinner were superb.

The best part about the hotel is its food and the homely touch which the room service people give to you. The manager is also very helpful and cordial. The rooms are spacious and clean and in our case on of the bed linen was a bit stained which they immediately changed. The room service is prompt. There are individual geysers for the rooms as well as central system. The food is very tasty and very homely and not oily and spicy.
