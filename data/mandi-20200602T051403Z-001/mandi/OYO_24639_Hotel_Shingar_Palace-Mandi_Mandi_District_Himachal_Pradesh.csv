mandi,Rooms were very bad. Towels were like given after dipping in a mud. No basic toiletries. Food was ok. Try to ignore this hotel if u really want to enjoy in Himachal. There are so many good hotels i found later near to this place.,Akhil,/Profile/123akirash,"Noida, India",10
mandi,The hotel is very basic. One can stay there if they have a small budget. I booked the hotel because I had to just sleep. The room was below the ground floor and was quite cold. Food was decent. The bus stand is at a walk able distance. Would need a vehicle is you have luggage.,Explorer22Mar85,/Profile/Explorer22Mar85,,30
mandi,Its average accommodation facility bang on the mandi road. Rooms are not that great but can definitely spend one night if u want to avoid night drive . We tried hot and sour soup it was also ok. Parking available...,saurabh gupts,/Profile/saurabhg807,,30
mandi,Property was ok for an overnight stay. Rooms are not clean. Linen is old and dirty. Room phones not working. Remote for air conditioners not working. Restaurant is dirty but food tastes ok. Overall a property only for night stay while travelling on highway. They insist only for cash payment and if you insist they tell you card machine not working.,gunjan s,/Profile/gunjans272,"New Delhi, India",20
mandi,"The hotel is good for night stay en route to Manali or Chandigarh...Rooms r spacious, moderately clean with good food..AC works fine ..I got a great deal from Cleartrip for this hotel. We visited lake Parashar & lake Rewalsar & stayed here for a night before leaving for Chandigarh airport.",drpriya86,/Profile/drpriya86,"Kolkata, India",40
mandi,"Stayed on 03/12/16, booked two rooms for five persons via goibibo site. Selected rooms along-with breakfast & dinner [MAP plan]. Booking price was quite economical.While ordering dinner, reception person handed us a menu book having only veg items on the insisting for non-veg item, we were allowed to order only one non-veg item for 5 person. Furthermore on ordering a starter, i.e.soup, we were told that the same was not included in the dinner plan, only main course was included, which according to me is odd.The hotels we booked in shimla & manali allowed us to order any item both veg & non-veg. Hotel should declare its policies clearly in the booking website, so people like us can take an informed decision.",SubhasishMallik,/Profile/SubhasishMallik,"Kolkata, India",20
mandi,"The property is right on the highway to Manali beside the Beas river. I had booked the hotel online and got a deal of A.C. room plus dinner package at less than 3K for three people, which was quite nice. The rooms in the hotel are quite spacious but do expect a bit of noise from all the cars plying on the highway. One thing I found annoying was that the smoke and exhaust from the kitchen of the restaurant came in through the rear windows of the room. So we had to keep the windows closed. But all in all, it was a nice and comfortable stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful too. The restaurant had a nice and cozy ambiance, with fast service and decent food. The wifi speed was also good and had good connectivity in the first and second floor. The hotel was under construction",Sinchan Sengupta,/Profile/179sinchans,"Kolkata, India",40
mandi,"I found this hotel more or less in the same value as I found Hotel Shikhar for Almora. Best part of the hotel is that it is right on the national highway to Kullu-Manali, on the Beas river. I was on a solo biking trip to Leh and this was supposed to be my first halt after leaving from Delhi. Got an online deal and hence I landed to the hotel. Reached in the evening and was supposed to leave early in the morning. Not a bad choice but not very pleasing either. I needed a good night's rest to comfort my back and make it ready for the tougher days ahead, but I couldn't find that. Reason was the room I got. It was on the lower floor and room had no proper ventilation. Besides, in hill hotels like this more down you move, more closer you go to septic tanks, drains and hotel garbage",Upendra Swami,/Profile/swamiupendra,"New Delhi, India",30
mandi,"Hotel Shingar in Mandi is right on the highway to Manali. The hotel has a restaurant and different type of rooms.  The hotel is value for money in terms of prices, however, there should not be too much expectation in terms of service.   Though service and food was satisfactory, the only hassle was tap water. In the morning we had to leave and there was nobody to attend to the water problem for about an hour.",Haaris H,/Profile/haaris_h007,"New York City, New York",40
