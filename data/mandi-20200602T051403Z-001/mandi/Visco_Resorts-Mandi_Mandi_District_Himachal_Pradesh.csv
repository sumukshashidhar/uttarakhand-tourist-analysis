mandi,We stayed for one night on our way to Palampur. The accommodation at the hotel was fine and clean but had no tea making facility. There was a notice in the room saying to run the shower for 5-10 mins to get hot water. You had to do this every time you wanted hot water which is an enormous waste of a precious resource. Our view from the room over the river and gardens was very pleasant. Our evening meal in the restaurant was however very disappointing. The table cloth was stained and the food poor. My Palek Paneer was simply tasteless and had very few pieces of paneer. The tomato shorga soup likewise was weak. Breakfast was considerably more tasty and enjoyable. ,Wanderlust_Scot,/Profile/Wanderlust_Scot,"Dundee, United Kingdom",30
