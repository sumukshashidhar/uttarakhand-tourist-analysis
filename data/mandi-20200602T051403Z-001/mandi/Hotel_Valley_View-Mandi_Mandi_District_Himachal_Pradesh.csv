mandi,Sprawling soulless place.  Cold and damp.  Disorganised and shabby.  Wifi not available in some lower floor rooms.  Some kind of renovations going on when visited.  Overpowering smell of solvent/glue around reception - no wonder receptionist so miserable!  Would not stay again ,20Nomad17,/Profile/20Nomad17,"Oxfordshire, United Kingdom",10
mandi,Stopped here on for one night on my way to Parashar Lake . The hotel is at the junction between the exit/entry of the town. It is a good place to pit-stop . The rooms were clean and hot water was available . The food is simple but tasty . Parking is available at the front of the hotel on the road for those who are driving.  ,ajayjames2018,/Profile/ajayjames2018,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
mandi,"It's good experience to stay at hotel valley view Mandi Himachal Pradesh. Room was good. As hotel is on highway, noise of vehicles disturbe your sleep. Food is good. There is no view of valley as per name of hotel",Ramneek Jain,/Profile/ramneekjain,"Chandigarh, India",40
mandi,"This entire property was booked for a friends wedding. Rooms were spacious, hospitality was good. And the banquets are good enought for a decent wedding. I got to stay in one of the rooms on the first floor and I still remember, when I opened the doors of the balcony, there was a table setup for coffee and the entire balcony was covered in fog, that was sereal.  Overall a very good experience.",Nirliptha,/Profile/Nirliptha,India,50

mandi,The hotel is mostly used by people as a stopover while travelling from manali to their destination. The hotel provide great food. The washroom facilities can be improved as my experience was bit of smelly. Overall good one.,joyienjoy,/Profile/joyienjoy,"Nashik, India",40
mandi,This hotel may be good for a lay over. But according to me it is upgraded Dharam shala. They still have to create comforts for the tourists. Rooms are not seen like this in a modern hotel / resort. We stayed just for a night. Checked in with lots of requests and argument with front staff and checked out much earlier than the Check out time since we wanted to pass night. Strategically located for long driving tourists to stay and take a break,Shubhrant,/Profile/Shubhrant,"New Delhi, India",20
mandi,*Nice rooms * Clean & spacious- had a night stop here so was perfect for that * Ample parking on the road * good restaurant & banquet facilities  * No lift so would need to climb stairs * Food is costly; they charge you more than 100 bucks for a plate of toasted bread,Vaibhav_Methi,/Profile/Vaibhav_Methi,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30

mandi,"We stayed overnight at mandi on our way to Manali. We found the room okay. Basic, clean. Had hot water, toiletries, and creature comforts like an air conditioner and blankets. The room seemed a little run down. The food was pretty average. The only things I liked about my meal were the rotis and the onions (given the chicken was undercooked and underwhelming!) The service was pretty quick though. The room per se was a tad overpriced. And it didn't offer any kind of view (which is an aberration in the Himalayas!). It should certainly be okay for a night stop over - no more. No less.",Sairekha S,/Profile/sairekhas,,30
mandi,"Stayed here just for a night while we were travelling from Chandigarh to Manali. Helpful staff, good spacious rooms. If getting some good sleep is all you expect, you'll be happy. But do not expect anything extra-ordinary. A bit expensive it might seem but the location makes it worthy. In winters, you'll love the weather here and surely give this hotel a higher rating for the experience!",vishal_negandhi,/Profile/vishal_negandhi,"Mumbai, India",30

mandi,"We stayed overnight in this hotel, the rooms are large and clean and hygenic, food is above average and service is good. The Hotel is right on the highway and is very easy to find which makes this place an ideal night halt. It was a tad on the pricey side for what they were offering but then we reached there late in the night looking for rooms.",thetravellerChennai,/Profile/thetravellerChennai,"Bengaluru, India",30

mandi,"We had a dealers meet on 3rd May,14 evening and reached there along with my colleagues from Delhi via Chandigarh by road after a tiring 6 hours road drive from Chandigarh at about 6PM. Mood was to relax after reaching the hotel and then prepare for the night function. Found the location on the highway much before the city centre of Mandi. Hotel is just cut off from the city with no connectivity of any kind. Staff can only understand the local language well i.e Hindi . Not much choice of food & don't demand taste. Rooms are spacious but furnishing are of poor taste. Next very day left back early morning for Delhi by road.",A Tripadvisor Member,/Profile/null,Gurgaon,30

mandi,"My wife, 2 kids (aged 1 and 3) and I stopped here for one night enroute from Chandigarh to Manali.  The location is convenient and the overall experience was decent.  Positives- the food was good considering we used it as a stop-over.  We had dinner and breakfast and ordered quite a variety- all of which was good.  The service and staff were quite responsive.  Geyser for hot water and AC in the room, no issues there.  The place was a little expensive in my opinion and the cleanliness (while not bad) can be improved.  I would stay here again enroute to Manali...",Vikas S,/Profile/901vikass,"Kuwait City, Kuwait",40
mandi,"On the way from Manali, I decided to stop over at Mandi. i checked in at this hotel, but was very disappointed with the cleanliness. Insects were all over the place. On asking the hotel staff, they explained that this is because of the season and due to the lights. i still dont take it as cleanliness can be improved. Food is ok, although i did not order much considering the cleanliness matter. Staff is quite helpful. Rates are little high considering the off-season and the quality of the hotel. I am sure if they want they can improve the hotel. One positive thing about this hotel was its location. You dont have to deviate from your route from Manali. Parking is available.",sameep2013,/Profile/sameep2013,"Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India",30
