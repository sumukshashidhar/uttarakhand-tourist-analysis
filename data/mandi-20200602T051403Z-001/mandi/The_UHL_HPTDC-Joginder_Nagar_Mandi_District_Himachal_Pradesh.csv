mandi,"Well it's a himachal govrnment property price reasonable, food is OK, cleanliness is not upto mark, but overall can stay there for 1 day. Toilets and towels are not clean, waiter only 3, telephone for our room was not working and they tried to ask for tax even though we had paid before, but later on settled.

mandi,"It is a govt. run property located on Palampur - Mandi highway , but one has to negotiate thru a busy market area with a couple of sharp curves & busy intersections & constant threat posed by rashly driven state tourism buses.  .  It is an ideal place to stay if travelling from Mcleodganj to Manali , located away from the hustle & bustle of the busy market area in a calm & quiet location  .  it is the only decent option to stay for those interested in an adrenaline rush by paragliding @  Bir & Billing & those interested to visit the Buddhist monasteries to feed your soul or ones who want to enjoy tranquility & some angling in Barot valley , as it is a very centrally placed location in this tourist circuit. all other accomodation choices are either homestays or very small",RajeevDr,/Profile/RajeevDr,,30
mandi,"We had planned an overnight halt at this place on the way to Manali.   The hotel is managed by HP tourism. Like any other government run hotel, this also is slightly run down in terms of furnishings.   The rooms and bathroom are clean but again it’s old fashioned and gives feeling of typical government run hotel.   Restaurant serves very good food. We had dinner and the veg food was a delight.   Staff is helpful and courteous.   Like hilly areas the shops / market closes by 6:30 pm in evening during winters. There are small eateries where you will get veg momos, noodles, thupka, chicken fry / mutton gravy etc.   We couldn’t venture out to do any sightseeing as we left the place early morning.

Good for a two night stay.",Uttamghosh,/Profile/Uttamghosh,"Mumbai, India",40

Very good option if you are looking something away from crowd.Rooms are good if you are not looking for luxury.one can have a peaceful vacation  in jogindernagar in this hotel as the options are very less.Nothing much to do in jogindernagar but one can go to barot for one day.service is good.Homestyle food is served in the restaurant.,v_loksi,/Profile/v_loksi,,50
mandi,"The hotel is very need and clean well furnished as shown in pictures, well mannered staff, good food and not like any type of incontestability during stay. the hotel is just opposite as our mind set about the government operated organisation in terms of Clutter. so i suggest that when ever you have to stay at that region you should be at ""The Uhl"" .",mech09297,/Profile/mech09297,"Bilaspur, India",50
mandi,"After my official  working at Palampur & joginder nagar ,i had planned to stay at some Good place in Joginder nager so that i can be refreshed for next day . So happy that my colleague from Kangra booked this place for me. Just looking at the place from the outside i had feeling that im going to stay at a very good place.Let me confess that during my recent visit to HIMACHAL this one was the hotel with biggest ,spacious & most open area with soothing greenery & scenic beauty around . Rooms were  just amazing with lot of space & beautiful extended wood work ( floor & roof too).In spite of very limited staff the cleanliness & services were not compromised. It will be worth mentioning here that Rooms were having cross ventilation. Excellent food was giving good taste in vibrant",jitendra s,/Profile/jitendrasinghsolanki,"Udaipur, India",50

mandi,"Being a small property even, in practical its better than Hotel Pinewood at Barog of HPTDC, since its staff are very courtieous as well as very helping, they are ready for assistance at any time, property is very quiet inspite being at roadside, fooding is hygenic as well as restaurant is nicely maintained. tarrifs are nominal and rooms bathrooms are clean.

mandi,"I stayed in Hotel Uhl,Joginder Nagar in May 2015 for 2 nights & for 01 day in The Tea Bud, Palampur,both of HPTDC presuming that Joginder Nagar which is at an Altitude of 2700m would be cooler as compared to Palampur which is at 1219m. However my presumption was wrong. Joginder Nagar was hotter than Palampur because Joginder Nagar is more inhabited with less greenery. Hotel Uhl has a huge garden in front but unlike most of the HPTDC properties it doesn't have much greenery,plants & trees. Garden with swings is a boon for families with kids It is one of the most economical hotels of HPTDC. Kitchen Staff & Receptionist were very cooperative. Hotel doesn't have a bar. Food is good. Kitchen is clean. Rooms are dark. Proper style of construction would have made the rooms more airy &",CARDIODOCTOR,/Profile/CARDIODOCTOR,"New Delhi, India",30
mandi,"We stayed at The UHL, a HPTDC promoted property in Joginder Nagar, HP, just for a night. I did not have much expectations from this hotel based on the few reviews that I read in Trip Advisor. However right from the moment we checked into the hotel on the late afternoon of 30th April till we checked out on 1st of May, we were pleasantly surprised with the cleanliness of the room, quality of food served, speed of response when we required something..very good experience. Would like to appreciate Mr Chander who did a fantastic job of taking care of us. ",vgkrishnan,/Profile/vgkrishnan,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
mandi,This is just a pit stop for a night from Dalhousie to Manali. You are sometime only guest in Hotel sometime. But Rooms are clean and staff is also good and helpful. Excellent place to be a pit stop. Quite place it you like places like this. Food in there restaurant is also good.,Uchit Shah,/Profile/uchitshah,"Mumbai, India",30
mandi,"A large soulless  hotel run by the H.P. Tourist Development Corporation. We appeared to be the only guests and our arrival was not exactly welcoming, all a bit of an effort for the staff. The room at the back of the property was a ""suite"" which was not very clean and the wet room was pretty grubby,  none of which encouraged us to eat in. Fortunately we had the 7.30 am train to catch so our one night stay was suitably brief. I guess you get what you pay for and it was cheap. Walking distance from the town centre and station.",PTL_9,/Profile/PTL_9,UK,20
mandi,"If you're visiting Jogindernagar - don't explore anything beyond UHL.  This is the best, pretty affordable & neat property that i personally used a couple of times after thoroughly exploring the options around.  Would rather say - look no further!!",Anoop_Singh_Attri,/Profile/Anoop_Singh_Attri,"New Delhi, India",40
mandi,The hotel is large and spacious with rooms accessed from open verandas amidst spacious grounds. The rates are quite reasonable. It is very quite and surrounded by hills. Each night we were treated to a spectacular electrical storm. The food was not bad. Unfortunately they did not take credit cards or change money so we ran out on our third night and had to make do with tomato soup. They have very few  staff and little English and we found the same people doing everything. Power cuts are frequent but they have a handy suppy of candles.,OceanWanderer,/Profile/OceanWanderer,Brisbane,40
mandi,"We stopped at The Uhl in Joginder Nagar primarily because it was past sunset by the time we reached and we did not want to drive at night.  It was an excellent decision and we ended up spending three nights there.  The Uhl is an unpretentious looking hotel with a pretty lawn and flower beds, just off the Mandi - Pathankot highway at Joginder Nagar.    Our room was clean and spacious with an enclosed sit out, very good value for the size.   In the morning we were regaled with bird song and were happy to find a Himalayan Whistling Thrush just outside our door!  Slate headed parakeets and other Himalayan birds flitted in and out of the hotels foliage.  Anyone who enjoys bird watching would be very pleased here.  Adequate parking is available in the hotel compound.  Service was warm",G A,/Profile/Gita-TA,India,50
