mandi,Dont book from OYO. It was a harrashment.  This hotel says that they have no connection with OYO. This hotel is not clean enough also. Looks good in picture but the reality is yhis is a hotel with dust and unclean atmosphere.,suman de,/Profile/SUMANDE,"Kolkata, India",10
mandi,The hotel is at a very nice location and situated at the bank of river Beas. The rooms on river side totally depends on availability. The staff of hotel is cooperative and very helping. The main road is just beside to hotel.,Mithlesh1989,/Profile/Mithlesh1989,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40

mandi,"We were travelling to Manali. On the way got this hotel in Mandi for one night stay. Ambience is decent if you get the river view room. Rooms are OK. Not so clean. Food was surprisingly good  We ordered Dal fry, and Chicken Tikka masala. The quantity as well as taste was perfect. Hotel is located right on the highway and parking is also located right beside the highway in front of the hotel. Overall if you are travelling from a long distance and want to halt here for a night, i would recommend this.",Umang Koul,/Profile/umangkoul890,,30
mandi,Stayed for a night for a official trip. Restaurant seems to be popular with localites . Rooms are specious & river facing. Some maintenance issues are there but still OK.  Room service is good & staff is courteous.  Recommended for solo travelers & family.,Dr_Shyam_S,/Profile/Dr_Shyam_S,"Gwalior, India",40
mandi,"we stayed there for three days in mid of August 2018, the view from the balcony is breath taking and peaceful, but services offered by the management is completely below average, they don't serve you tea before 8 Am in the morning, every time you order lunch or dinner they take around one hour to serve you the same, there are electricity prob in the hotel and they told us their Gensets were not working, so we had to bath in cold water, i would recommend stay here only for a day coz no one will have more patience and toleration beyond that !! PS:- Food though served late was good in taste and competitive in pricing also, staff behaviour was also fine but do not expect anyone to put in any extra effort for your comfort..",Utsav7777,/Profile/Utsav7777,"New Delhi, India",30
mandi,The hotel is situated at the river bank and view of hills and river is excellent from first and second floor rooms. The restaurant is also very nice and food quality is also good. While getting down from Manali to Chandigarh or Delhi it is a very convenient place to stay.,kschouhan,/Profile/kschouhan,"Jaipur, India",30
mandi,"Rooms are not well maintained, they don't accept card payment, Restaurant table sheet were dirty, food was just OK, male wash room does not have lock, management have to see and fix this thing and all, it's just an average hotel with lack of maintance, not highly recommended.

mandi,When you are travelling from Chandigarh to Manali and you want to have a lunch break River Bank could be a good place. You could avoid getting into Mandi town as this hotel is on the main road. There is ample parking space. Hotel has buffet service for groups or you could order on individual basis at the restaurant. The hotel has a nice river view on the back side.,Venky2011,/Profile/Venky2011,"Mumbai, India",40

mandi,"The hotel lacks the facilities.. To start with, the rooms were equipped with outdated windows ac, which could not cool the room properly. Room service was really bad...sorry not bad....worst I have ever experienced. Housekeeping needs to reminded of their work....inspite of that they didn't do the needful... All in all....avoid staying there....",sunny_dun,/Profile/sunny_dun,"Dehradun, India",20
mandi,Well this hotel doesn't look big from outside bur it is big from inside... For parties you can book the rooms here very easily and in moderate price .. Food is good there .. But I don't find the location of this hotel good overall I give 4/5 to this hotel,705onams,/Profile/705onams,,40
mandi,"very average place, we stayed in here en route to Chandigarh. rooms were very spacious, but can be maintained better. i complained about clogged drain and was shifted to full family  suite. really appreciate the staff. but all in all property can be maintained better. if one wants to do a stop over for a night, this is decent place. dont expect too much of hospitality.",vamsineti,/Profile/vamsineti,"Mumbai, India",20
mandi,"The views are great but unsure if they are the asset of the hotel or of the location. There certainly are better hotels that can be booked. The service is average, the views are great, the rooms are decent and the overall stay experience is slightly less than average.",SujitLalwani,/Profile/SujitLalwani,Bengaluru,30

mandi,"The hotel is very good from location point of view; situated on the main road and facing the Beas River. Though, the experience wasn't as good as expected. We had booked three family rooms. The staff had initially given us two on one floor and the other on a separate floor (all three of them facing the Beas River). Since we wanted all the rooms on the same floor we were given so but the third room was pretty horrible. It was dirty, including bedsheets, blankets and the bathroom as well. The TV wasn't working. Since it was a matter of one night, we adjusted. The buffet (dinner and breakfast) didn't have much variety. Though, the food was good from taste POV. Overall, was an average experience. Wouldn't recommend this hotel for a family planning a long stay..",babin k,/Profile/babink2016,,20
mandi,I had very bad experience with this Hotel. We booked two rooms through Goibibo about 4 months back but during check in the guys at the reception reluctantly gave only one room and said that the whole hotel is fully occupied and Goibibo has made a mistake. The room provided was large but the linens were not cleaned after last use. The room was two floors down. The area around the room had a function couple of days back. The area was not cleaned. It was full of filth and smelling like hell. Moreover the lift was out of my order. But Goibibo somewhat saved the day. On talking to the representative of Goibibo they in turn talked to the reception. Then only the Hotel provided another room in the adjacent building which they claimed to own. There was no hot water availability in the ,FellowTraveler612450,/Profile/FellowTraveler612450,,10
mandi,"I stayed here overnight. The staff was courteous enough to get us food at 11 in the night although they take the last order at 10. We reached pretty late. The room was good as the balcony faced the river. It was extremely cold. We stayed in a deluxe room which was quite large. No hot water though at night. Nonetheless, very good value for money. Stay overnight on the way to Manali as it is on the highway past the Mandi town.",KunalPande,/Profile/KunalPande,"New Delhi, India",40
mandi,"Average hotel with average food, but easy to locate as its on NH connecting Mandi to  Kullu -Manali, limited parking facility. Friendly hotel staff. Situated on banks of river beas as its name suggest.",vivek c,/Profile/vivek1232015,"Shimla, India",30
mandi,"River bank is my favorite hotel on my trips to Bilaspur to Kullu. Mandi is strategically placed, because Kullu is approx. 72 km. and Manali 40km further. These places can easily be visited in a day, because Kullu and Manali both are expensive places to live, my suggestion is to keep Mandi as the locus and travel so that you can enjoy the beauty. Also the climate of Mandi is very pleasant, AC room is not required throughout the year. Being a frequent traveller to this belt I can assure you that River Bank is one of the best places to stay. With such helpful staff and wonderful food and lodging it makes the stay very comfortable.",Qnal,/Profile/Qnal,"New Delhi, India",50
mandi,We accommodate for a night only. Rooms bed toilet were clean. room service are poor. Food quality is not worth as per price and they have credit card machine but  its not working. Out of 10 I will prefer to give 5 number,Hemant S,/Profile/HemantS373,,30
mandi,"Located at a good place on the way from Bilaspur to Kullu. The plus point is the natural scenic view from the back side of the room with mountains and small river. Room was spacious, but not very clean. Bathroom towels were also not clean and smelly. Food was OK. Overall average hotel for 1 night stay on the way to Kullu.",Akhileshjoshi,/Profile/Akhileshjoshi,"Jaipur, India",30
mandi,"We were en route to Shimla from Manali and due to Valentine's day, we could not get any reservations in neither Shimla nor Manali and hence had to stay at this hotel.   Pathetic! We had to ask for linen change, bed change and also heater for which they charged extra. The beds were stinking and the bath room was unclean.   Sleep in your car if you have to but do not stay here. There arent many hotels in this stretch that are good - so push comes to shove, you have no other option than sleeping river side.",MumbaiPradeep,/Profile/MumbaiPradeep,"Mumbai, India",10

mandi,"This one is simpe and a budget hotel, which is in Mandi district and on way towards Kullu & Manali. If you have started from Delhi, a nice place to stay. The room rents are not that high and you can get good discount. Food served is also of good quality and one can see teh Beas river flowing from almost all the rooms.",Brish Bhan Vaidya,/Profile/BrishBhan,"New Delhi, India",30
mandi,River bank was the place where we stayed for my friends marriage. Place was ok and tho the rooms. I was not sure bout the Marriage arrangements till last time. But when i came back to Hotel with Barat. I was stunned with the arrangement and decoration. It was looking really beautiful from inside. Reception was really nice. Food was awesome and tasty.

mandi,Yesterday only I had visited this hotel. Located at a good place of about 4-5 KM from bus stand with supreme natural scenic beauty from the backyard of the room with mountains and small water pond....Just Marvellous. But room interiors were quite disappointing and also the rooms were not very clean. Bathrom accessories and towels were also not clean & tidy. Not very expensive & a good budgetary hotel,NirdoshGupta,/Profile/NirdoshGupta,Gurgaon,30
mandi,"Since Visco resorts was not available, they suggested we could stay here. The manager in River Bank was courteous and honoured the phone confirmation. The hotel itself is spacious - wide corridor and big rooms. The airconditioner was new, toilet was clean and bed was comfortable. There was no hot water in the bathroom, although they claimed there was a solar powered central geyser. There were no toiletries and one towel. There was no road noise in the room, inspite of the hotel being on the Mandi Kullu road. There was not much of a river view from the 1st floor room we stayed in. The overall feel is that the hotel is that its still unfinished.  Food was average in the restaraunt (there are separate Veg and Non-Veg restaraunts). There were fans (no AC) and lighting was somewhat",rajesh0agrawal,/Profile/rajesh0agrawal,"New Delhi, India",30
