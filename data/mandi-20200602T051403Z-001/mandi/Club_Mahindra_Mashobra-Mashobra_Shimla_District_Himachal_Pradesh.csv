Take valley view rooms as they have excellent view of mountains & valley. The resort heating facility works for only 12 hours of the day only that’s from 6 P.M to 6 A.M. Even during that period the heating is not Upto the requirement. It was snowing whole day & when we were in our room it was chilling cold whole day. We were wearing 3 layers of clothing & sitting covered in blankets. When I complaint to the staff I was told that they don’t have proper heating facility for 24 hours. That’s a very big draw back.

Property is located away from city and in a clam area . Property is much suited to be called as a hotel than a resort .very less open spaces and what ever available was covered for Christmas and new year celebrations .Rooms are spacious and  recreation rooms are large enough . Room heating is centralized and not adequate for bigger rooms when temp is about 2-3 degrees . Places that can be visited from here is nature park, Naldhera  and Tattapani ( river rafting & hot springs) . As  in every club Mahindra resorts , travel desk charges are very high.

As a Club Mahindra member I felt cheated hence fought with them. Once they realised they could not make a fool out of me they gave me a better room.  Club Mahindra members should be careful of what you'll get post paying for huge sum for membership. Walk in customers get the same room for half the price what you pay for the ASF only let alone the lumpsum which you pay for the membership.  I felt very cheated & reduced my stay from 4 days to 1 day & shifted to Club Mahindra NALDERA which is a fantastic property.

I also asked about conditions of Hotel units and standard of the rooms. The staff told me that this is a leased property and a very old property so the standard is not that good. It will be better if I change my booking and get another Club Mahindra Resort booked. He specifically talked about the new property that has come up at Naldhera, 9 Kms away.

No swimming pool 4. Very congested and noisy.The loud music played in activity room till late night will kill the peace one looks for!( it's so disturbing that we preferred to have ala carte dinner in restaurant rather than have buffet spread near activity room) And we were not the only family feeling this way. During our stay the activity room for let out to a corporate grp and then there was no control over the sound! If the reception needs to be told to stop the loud noise, doesn't it reflect badly? 5.

mandi,The drive from Delhi to Mashobra took us under 9hours as we started early and the roads are in good condition. Reaching the resort early didn't serve any purpose though as the Club Mahindra was not geared to receive guests early... not only was there no welcome drink( that's a first in my 17 years as a member) but the staff lacked the hospitality to even smile n welcome you. The rooms are basic but clean. The restaurant is run down and the food insipid. The staff here too were totally disinterested in serving.  The fun zone staff were the only ones who were working as expected- enthusiastic and welcoming. The new resort coming up in Naldhera should probably be a better option than this one at Mashobra.,NITASH,/Profile/NITASH,India,30

Spring mattresses are hammock-like (bad for tired backs) and they don't have firm options - options for pillows are present, I must confess. Basic in-room furniture & detailing not in sync with elaborate lobby appointments - coffee table is something you'd find in an economy hotel.

With the tariff, I would say its overpriced, unless you are a member and want to utilize your time share.  Also, for a family - the liveliness of a Goa or Munnar CM property is clearly missing.
