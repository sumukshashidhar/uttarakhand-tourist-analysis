mandi,"We had gone for white water rafting at Tattapani and stopper at the Flower Creeper Food Corner for lunch.  Small and cozy, but yummy food. The owners, themselves take the order and serve. Quick service, reasonable and above all, yummy!!  Enjoyed the lunch after the tiring morning of rafting and walking.",Krisvacation,/Profile/Krisvacation,"Bengaluru, India",40
