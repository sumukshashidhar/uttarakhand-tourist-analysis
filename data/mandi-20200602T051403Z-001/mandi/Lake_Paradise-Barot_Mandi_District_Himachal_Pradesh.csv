mandi,I booked this hotel from makemytrip and when reached at barot we found that the room is at ground floor and it is quite substandard . That room can only be a store room with no proper ventilation.  Though the location of the hotel is good. The staffs are co operating and not trustworthy.,sum1kraG,/Profile/sum1kraG,"Franklin, Tennessee",20
mandi,"Hotel lake paradise is situated just in front of the PWD guest house and is on the main road.  Hotel has ample parking and rooms are situated on 1st floor via metal stairs.   There is a family suite as well as for couples, basic amneties are provided including beds, tv, geysers in washrooms and toiletries.  Beds are comfortable and has enough switches and charging points.  Just outside the room wheat fields are there which provides for great view as the first sun rays fall.   The food is an issue definitely that one has to manage from nearby there are lot of cafes.  Dinner too is till 8.30 max.   In short a budget guest house with a comfortable stay",batramadhur,/Profile/batramadhur,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
