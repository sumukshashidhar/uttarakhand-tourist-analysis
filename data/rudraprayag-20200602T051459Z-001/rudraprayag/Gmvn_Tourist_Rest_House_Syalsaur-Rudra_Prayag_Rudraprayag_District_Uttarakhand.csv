rudraprayag,"Presently It is in very pathetic condition, please don't think about going if you want a peaceful family vacation because you will welcomed by JBC / Bulldozers' loud noise , lot of dust everywhere, no view of mandakini river as GMVN claimed, by chance if you are a passerby from this road and would like to stop for lunch or dinner then please don't stop because they serve stale stuff which has been kept in fridge in a place that does not have electricity for most of the day. And yet, the prices on the menu are so high! We ate rotten mushroom and were honored by diarrhoea. The manager Mr Yashwant Gosai and his official cook were absent from this TRH, presumably working somewhere else in their time. This sick unit is manage by three man army who are on contract / temporarily basis.",DrAjayAggarwal,/Profile/DrAjayAggarwal,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",10
rudraprayag,"Very well located. Next to river. Just adequate facilities. Food is below average. So be prepared with your stuff. Market is nearby. One can get fresh vegetables, eggs, cornflakes, cold drinks etc. Only arrangements they had was Poha and Parantha for breakfast and matter/mushroom paneer and dal for dinner. The location on Google Map is accurate. So no need to countercheck.",Anoop A,/Profile/AnoopA334,,40
rudraprayag,"Wonderful location. Everything fine. Food ,service etc good. Safely recommend an overnight stay. View of Alakananda and Mandakini sangam site from the balcony of aGMVN guest house is an awesome feeling . Will make you hypnotized for hours. Highly recommended.",Swapan Roy,/Profile/Swapanroy,"Silchar, India",40
rudraprayag,"This was my second stay at Syalsaur. The first was amazing, with verdant lawns and beautiful setting. Now the place is what is left over from the floods of 2013. The satff continues to be equally warm and helpful, just that the lawns are gone, number of cottages has reduced to half and the beauty of the place is no longer what it was. Yet, I would still recommend the place for the beauty of what is left and the location by Mandakini river. The bathroom shower did not have a knob in our room and we had to take bucket bath, which was not what I like.",Avinash_blr,/Profile/Avinash_blr,"Bengaluru, India",40
rudraprayag,"Minimalistic log huts that may not keep you warm, but promises one of the most awesome experiences. Right next to Mandakini river, you cannot ask for a better location. Food is average at best, but one does not stay here for food.   Himalayan experience with the burbling sound of Mandakini is simply magical!",Goutham Shetlur,/Profile/OffBeat123,"Bengaluru, India",50
rudraprayag,"Just beside the Kedarnath road, approx. 20 km from Rudraprayag, and also just beside river Mandakini is this property situated, location is just AWESOME to say the least, Mandakini river is flowing just at a stone throwing distance from the property, rooms well furnished with private balconies, actually these are Cottages, food served was equally good, staff very polite and helpful, only thing you will not get any shops at this place so be prepared for it.",Anirban,/Profile/Anirban0302,"Kolkata, India",50
rudraprayag,"I traveled with a large family group. The GMVN rest house turned out to be an unexpected and pleasant surprise - honestly had not expected the Cottages to be so beautiful and well kept. But it was sad that a large part of the resort had got washed away several years back and GMVN did not build it back again. The pictures on the net are of the time before the landslides... So the kids did miss the lawns. The spirit and kindness of the guest house's management and staff is worth mentioning.... In fact the only reason why the place is running is because of their hard work and attitude... They are running the kitchen in a tent, they themselves stay at one of the damaged cottages.The only thing to watch out for is the high construction that has disrupted their water supply, I wonder",prasantgongo,/Profile/prasantgongo,"Bengaluru, India",50
rudraprayag,"It's nice place to stay. Beautiful river view. They provide free Wi-Fi, accept PayTM. Manager and staff is also good and helpful.

rudraprayag,"During our recent visit to Kedarnath, Tunganath etc we had spent one day at Siyalsour GMVN. It was excellent in all aspects.  At first I must mention the cordiality and hospitality of the staffs. All the time they were very polite and very supportive. Food served with limited option but quite tasty and quality was also good. The original establishment had 23 rooms along with a restaurant. During flash flood in 2013 15 rooms were washed away. Currently 7 rooms are available for booking. Price is approx.  Rs.2500/ incl Tax. The rooms are vey nice , clean and well maintained. Restaurant is currently functional in a big tent under a tree. For leisure stay it is highly recommended.",KuntalGupta,/Profile/KuntalGupta,Kolkata,50
rudraprayag,"No words to express about the Hospitality of the handful of staff in TRH,Syalsaur. I stayed in this place in the first week of May 2018 during by Char Dham Yatra.  1. Booked 3 deluxe huts and the huts were more than luxurious which good Mattress,Geyser and toilet facilities.  2. The Food and the hospitality of Mr.Yaswant Gusain and 3 of their staff were excellent and I must specially appreciate the support staff for cooking.  3.There is no restaurant as such but a deluxe tent by the Mandakini side and the ambience is beautiful.  4.Mandakini does not run in full flow during May season and when we went down to the river from the rest house we found the river bed totally unfit with beer bottles and human excreta all around on one side and lorries lined up on the other side to load",saikumarnc,/Profile/saikumarnc,Chennai,50
rudraprayag,Amazing location and great hospitality under able management of Yashwant Gusain. The authority should increase the number of staff since the present number seems to be inadequate. An organised kitchen needs and better infrastructure is further to looked in to. ,Pratik G,/Profile/pratikghosal,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",40

rudraprayag,We booked it during our Kedarnath trip. Reviews were good. There was no problem in locating the resort because it is well known to most of the local taxi drivers. If I have to describe my experience I would say amazing!. Mandakini is flowing with a divine sound and you can hear all sorts of sweet words of nature. Food is also amazing. We met Yashwant ji who manages the resirt. He is extremely helpful and kind. I would love to go again and stay. 5 stars from me for this lovely resort.,Sudhanshu S,/Profile/sudhanshus93,"Ahmedabad, India",50
rudraprayag,"We stayed here while on our trip to Kedarnath ji. As we were tired and dusk was nearing, we preferred to stay in Rudra prayag. GMVN is located at a right spot. However locating GMCN was a battle, because of hardly any signage. Room balconies offer a perfect view of confluence of river Alaknanda and Mandakini.   Room tariffs are on high side and rooms weren't upto the mark. Taps were leaking and toiletries were missing. Restaurant is satisfactory. I found more of govt employees, staying here. I wouldn't recommend GMVN rudra prayag seeing its high tariff rate.",scorpionsumit,/Profile/scorpionsumit,"New Delhi, India",30
rudraprayag,This a complete mystic place justifies each second and paisa spent there. Property consist of wooden  houses on bankriver surrounded by mountain range and trees.  It has got peace and tranquility engulfed to place which is very very rare now a days.  Houses are big enough with clean bathroom and warm atmosphere inside. In the winter time they do provide heaters and wood itself has advantage of warmness.   Property has got big garden and lawn so that you can spend quality time with nature and your near ones.  They have got a restaurant attached with property with limited option in the menu but most of their offerings are freshly made and tasty.  Property is situated near to rudraprayag so even you can visit that place also.  In my opinion if you want to stay in lap of nature,Manandani,/Profile/Manandani,"Mumbai, India",40

rudraprayag,"Wooden houses.  River flowing next to Rest house situated among mountains, clean atmosphere and tranquility in the air. No doubt this place is called paradise on earth.   This place comes on the way to rudraprayag and deserves stay for 2 nights on its own for sure.  Food options are limited and do not expect other facilities due to far distanced position  from commercial places.  Power comes and goes frequently so its not reliable at all.  Rooms are small so are the bathrooms but clean. Staff is quite friendly and supportive.

rudraprayag,"Nice views from the room. Decent food, and a value for money too.   But I don't think the rooms are worth their price (even though I wen't there in the off season and got a discount).   But it seems like the best hotel around this place.",sawhneysaab,/Profile/sawhneysaab,Delhi,40
rudraprayag,Gmvn hotel was clean and on a very good location.  We enjoyed the stay but the food was not at all good.  The money we paid for food was waste.  Better to eat out.

rudraprayag,"On our recent driving holiday in the Garhwal Himalayas we had planned to drive from Rishikesh to Joshimath following the rivers path. Instead of staying at Rudraprayag we decided to drive on to Syal Saur about 27 Km upriver on the Mandakini. In hindsight, this was an excellent decision. The GMVN Resort in Syal Saur is located on the Mandakini riverside and you can walk out from your cottage and actually tip-toe in the river!! The view  of the river and the surrounding mountain range is simply gorgeous!! You have a variety of birds residing at the resort itself! It is a treat to watch these beauties. The cottages are very tastefully furnished and decorated,using  bamboo in various forms. We were the only guests since February is quite cold and considered ""off-season"".

Add to that the surroundings which are beautiful and peaceful ... one feels that one can stay for a couple of days and relax/ meditate/introspect/rejuvenate . Simple food , simple rooms , ok service but don't expect much from the management , because , for any problem they can get away with out doing any thing simply by quoting the interior location . Good place but keep your expectations low .",avsharma,/Profile/avsharma,newdelhi,40
rudraprayag,"GMVN has properties of varying standards and this is one of the best and I guess one of the least known.  Its spread over a 10 acre grounds right alonside the Mandakini river, and is an ideal halt if you are traveling to kedarnath. The rooms are styled like self contained cottages, with all basic facilities.  Very clean and reasonably priced ( Rs 1800 for a double room with taxes in October)",partha2504,/Profile/partha2504,"Mumbai, India",50
rudraprayag,"Right on the banks of Mandakini, mostly made up of bamboo huts which provide an atmosphere which concrete walls cannot provide, the accomodation is great hideaway to disconnect from the rest of the world and re-connect with any other option.

rudraprayag,This was one of the best hotels we stayed in Uttarakhand. It is completely wood made individual cottage rooms and everything inside it is wood made. It is located on the banks for the river Mandakini with amazing views. Food is good too. Heater and geyser facilities are not available but you will get a bucket of hot water whenever you need for bath. We loved the experience. It is right on the highway to Kedarnath.
