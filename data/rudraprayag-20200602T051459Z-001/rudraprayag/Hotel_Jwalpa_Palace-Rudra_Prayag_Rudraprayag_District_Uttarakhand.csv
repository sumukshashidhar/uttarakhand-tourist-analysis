rudraprayag,"We stayed here for one night on the way to Badrinath which is next day of Diwali. Due to off season, no guest was there in hotel. Services are okay. Rooms can be better. But whatever they charged is okay and value for money.",AnandG1982,/Profile/AnandG1982,"New Delhi, India",30
rudraprayag,While returning from Badrinath stayed for one night at this hotel. Outward appearance is very good but the room was very shabby. Bathroom was very dirty. Despitebeing cleaned by housekeeping staff after asking them to clean the bathroom was not good. Asked them to change pillow covers also. Night sleep is very important as in Chardham Yatra travelling is very tedious. Dinner was tasteless and slow.Again informed them to keep  breakfast ready by 8 AM . When we went at 8 AM nothing was ready. After one hour they brought tasteless poha and some roti I think. Overall very slow service. Very average hotel.,Vijaya G,/Profile/793vijayag,Hyderabad,20
