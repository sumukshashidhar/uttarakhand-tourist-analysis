rudraprayag,The Property is located at a scenic location but apart from that whatever promises were made by our travel agent from Dehradun regarding the place was false. The tents and beddings were unclean. Dinning Room was also unhygienic though one boy who was there for maintenance provided us decent food Electricity was available only 6pm to 6am In Washroom washbasin tap was broken  Bonfire promised but at the camp was told that it is not allowed Overall experience was not good. Not value for money.,Explorer_Bhavs,/Profile/Explorer_bhavs,"Navi Mumbai, India",10

rudraprayag,"I had reviewed it in June but can't see the review so writing again.  We stayed here with two kids and another friend and his kids. The place has beautiful surrounding, with slight elevation. One can walk up to the hillside and sit amongst trees. The tents are clean and well maintained. Mr. Negi, Rahul and all other staff members are extremely welcoming and helpful. The chulha cooked good is simply awesome and they try to cook as per preference. Delicious local food. In the evening they arranged campfire and we had a great time listening to local music and dancing too. There is vast open space to walk play and enjoy nature. Really nice place, recommended for all.",Anjali S,/Profile/AnjaliS547,"Chennai, India",50

rudraprayag,I stayed here with my family for two nights.  This place has a different charm and beauty. They have clean tents and washrooms . The staff is very helpful and kind. You get hot water on prior notice. Food was simple and very nice.  We got a chance to do bornfire and it was great! We did treks to Tungnath temple and Chandrashila which were quite close. It is a treat for your eyes during both day and night. The scenic beauty from this place is excellent. I have uploaded few images that I clicked during my stay. I would totally recommend this place for anyone who is visiting Chopta .,Akhil128,/Profile/Akhil128,,50
rudraprayag,"Duration of Stay ‚Äì 30th Sep to 2nd Oct  Chopta is located at around 30 kms distance from the nearest town Ukhimath. While the road from Ukhimath to Chopta is in very good condition, there are hardly any public transport available there. No electricity has reached Chopta and so far it has been protected from any type of concrete construction. Hence to provide comfortable stay in Chopta is much harder than it appears. Even then, there are camps who has successfully created a comfortable and enjoyable stay for people who are interested in exploring this place. Chopta Meadows is one of them.  Chopta Meadows tents are located 5.5 km towards Ukhimath from the main Chopta (where Tunganath trek starts from), adjacent to the road on a slope of the hill, along with other two camps.
