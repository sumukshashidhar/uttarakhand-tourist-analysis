rudraprayag,"A very nice resort situated at hills with beautiful view of mountain ranges, nice cottages with basic amenities. Mr Sumit Uniyal the owner was very helpful from booking of helicopter tickets to Kedarnath ( enchant tours) to making our stay comfortable. The resort stay is booked along with helo tickets. The dinner was nice. Deserves a stay. Post Kedarnath Darshan we proceeded to Badrinath by road via Chopta (rated mini Switzerland) and halted for tea break.A must halt very scenic and beautiful location. Halted at Joshimath and next day proceeded to Badrinath. On return proceeded to Auli a hill station 15 km from Joshimath.  Beautiful rolling hills and Nandadevi peak visible. Garhwal Mandal hotel at site for stay. Chair lift ride available and cable car too from Joshimath toAuli",Rajiv W,/Profile/RajivW22,,40
