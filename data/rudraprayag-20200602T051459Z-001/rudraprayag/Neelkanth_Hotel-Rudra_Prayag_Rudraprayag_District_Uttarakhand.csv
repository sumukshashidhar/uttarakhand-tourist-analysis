rudraprayag,"The hotel is located at main Chopta Market bang on the starting point of the Tungnath trek route. It's a budget property. The rooms are reasonably sized. Some are triple bedded and others 4 bedded. There a a small dhaba sort of facility attached to the property and you can also get room service from there (beware the dhaba incharge tries to fleece by over counting the roties every time)Other bigger dhabas are located nearby in the market, but you can get tawa roti in the hotel dhaba where as market dhabas all serve only tandoori roti. The bathroom was not upto the mark with out of order washbasins and had a very dirty look as a whole. There is no electricity supply in chopta and everyone including this property depende on solar power. Here the solar power is switched on after 7",Roamer077,/Profile/Roamer077,"Lucknow, India",30
