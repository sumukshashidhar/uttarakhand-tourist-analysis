rudraprayag,"We were group of 10 family members,this campsite is located at a beautiful valley close to guptakashi,  tents were clean and maintain. Manager Rana was very active and hospitable. Arrow helipad is just 2kms from Adhvanta guptakashi campsite. Food was simple but delicious overall recommended place for Chardham Yates.",Suresh824,/Profile/Suresh824,"New Delhi, India",50
rudraprayag,"i was not expecting such a lovely service in such height as we reached after crossing yamunotri and gangotri. These people are doing fabulous job, 10 out of 10 on every point be it a location, service, food, staff behavior, co orperation etc. I was really warm hearted seeing their effort to make me comfortable. i stay in thier barkot resort as well so i knew they will not disappoint me but listening from others about services in such height. I am really impressed. I wish i stay in adhvanta badrinath also. I will recommend everyone. thankyou",Solotraveller,/Profile/ajk047,Nepal,50
