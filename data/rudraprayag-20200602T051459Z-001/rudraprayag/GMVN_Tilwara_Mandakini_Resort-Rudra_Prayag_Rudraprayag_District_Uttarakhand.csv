rudraprayag,"We spent 3 nights and GMVN on our trip to Kedarnath. The property is at a beautiful location with river Mandakini flowing by the side. As it is a govt resort, don't expect great service. That said, rooms were clean, bathrooms decent and overall service was good. The food was homely and nice. We enjoyed our dinner. Breakfast was one item and generally average.   We went into the river couple of evenings and was very rejuvenating after a tired day of travel and trek. Water was cold but once you get it, felt very good.   We had a helicopter from Guptkashi and the drive is about 2 hours from GMVN. Kedarnath was wonderful and very less crowd. We did a trek to Tungnath (again a 2 hour drive from GMVN) and that was fabulous. ",SatishI77,/Profile/SatishI77,"Bengaluru, India",40

rudraprayag,The hotel is government owned and is maintained very nicely. The rooms and bathrooms are clean. The best thing is if you get the room facing the river what more you could ask for.  The place is very beautiful and calm. The menu in Every gnvn is same and even the taste is same. The kitchen is not very functional as it got constructed last year only. The food is a little overpriced. But the hotel is worth it for a weekend getaway. ,manasi deshwal,/Profile/Manasides89,"Manali, India",50
rudraprayag,"Two storey cottages in a very quiet location - birds chirping throughout the morning and a nip in the air.  The cottages are well designed.  Well furnished.  The bathroom fittings are very well done.  The entire complex has been rebuilt recently and hence is modern.  The restaurant is homely.  The food fresh and made to order for the guests.  The staff (public sector) surprisingly very responsive and courteous.  We had a bonfire before dinner, with the staff doing their best to make it a success with some fireworks.",Narasimhan S,/Profile/shrin54,Pune,40
rudraprayag,"A good pit stop enroute to Badrinath/Kedarnath. Amongst the few recently developed properties of GMVNL. Well maintained. Courteous staff. Excellent property with quite a scenic view of the Mandakini river flowing just next to the property. Only draw back is that they don't have triple occupancy. Food: What they lack in variety, they make up for in taste. All in all, worth every penny they charge.",Nishiboy,/Profile/Eternalseeker1,,50
rudraprayag,"This rest house is located right on the banks of river Mandakini. It is easily accessible and has come up just last year (2017). All the rooms are similar in looks and features. The super deluxe ones have AC. The staff was very courteous. We stayed there last week on our way to Auli. The river bank is at a lower level than the overall hotel property. So, one can't have a full view of the river from any rooms, but only partial view from some of the rooms.",Omkaar,/Profile/Omkaar,"Mumbai, India",50

rudraprayag,"Firstly, the location of this hotel is excellent as it is on the bank of Mandakini river. The river is easily accessible and it is a great avenue for some fun and frolic.  The accommodations are very modern. The quality of the bathrooms especially is very impressive.  This hotel is a perfect spot for some rest and relaxation, and spending time with family. The staff are very friendly, and our check in process was smooth and quick.  A bonus point is that there are 2 very lovable dogs at the hotel as well!

rudraprayag,"I stayed only for a night. However, the best place I could have stayed during the whole trip and the best staff and people I would have met during the whole trip. The property is new and located adjacent to the Mandakini River and in middle of forest but reachable directly via road.   The Manager and staff are very helpful and accommodating and taken good care of food and arrangements.   The property is well maintained and a true natureâ€™s paradise. One should make a necessary halt at this property either while going towards or returning from the pilgrimage and relax and enjoy.  One day is bliss two days here is marvellous. One can also go to the riverside and enjoy the picturesque view of Mandakini River.  A must stay place",Akhil S,/Profile/AkhilS994,,50
rudraprayag,"Visited this property to and from our trip to Kedarnath 18-24 September 2018....Among many other GMVN resorts.   This was the best of all and fantastic value for money.  Clean, well appointed cottages, courteous staff, good food and great overall experience.  Sad to say that other resorts were below average...Serving only alu-paratha and palav for b/f, lunch and dinner, not to mention run-down attitude of staff.    Staff at Tilwara were surprisingly enthusiastic and keen to serve.  The full printed menu was actually available to order...And taste was good !    Much credit must go to Anita Mewad, the manager in-charge wo seemed to doing a great job keeping her team cheerful.    Best was, when all the staff stood by our car and waved us good bye and made sure to tell us to come",Srinath K,/Profile/srinathk2014,"Bengaluru, India",50
