rudraprayag,"The location of the resort is excellent. Perhaps the best in Guptkashi. The resort has both tents and cottages. We stayed in one of the cottages. The rooms are basic but facilities are adequate. The food is also basic Indian food but the food is tasty.  The staff led by Mr. Lucky are quite helpful and cooperative and they tried everything they could to make our stay comfortable and safe.   One should not expect any kind of luxury but in a place like Guptkashi, the facilities are one of the best available.",Debashis Mukherjee,/Profile/debmuk-traveller,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
rudraprayag,"Anyone who does the Kedarnath and Tungnath yatra knows that it isn’t an easy journey. Staying at Camp Nirvana really solidified our experience with memories to last a lifetime. We stayed in the rooms at Camp Nirvana and the hospitality is SO warm and accommodating. The rooms and toilets are clean and the food is excellent. Thank you to Lucky, Sumith and team for a wonderful experience. We will keep this place in our hearts forever. With love from South Africa. ",Sheina Kiyara Gokool,/Profile/sheinakiyara,,50

rudraprayag,I had booked 2 tents for 13-14th October 2018 and payed them 50% in advance. But due to some reasons we had cancelled our trip and same I have informed to Camp Nirvana through mail (on 10th September 2018) as well by telephonic talk and requested for refund of the amount.  When I called them they said that their computer operator is on leave and they will process it as soon as he comes back. But now its going to be more than 15 days that they have not even replied to my mail. The amount is still to be refunded.  Poor show!,DrAbhinav2014,/Profile/DrAbhinav2014,"Lucknow, India",10
rudraprayag,"Camp Nirvana is really basic, you have to be aware of that. But there actually is not really comfort in the whole area. This area is poor and has no facilities. But though it is a nice place to stay. The tents are decent and equipped with basic things. There is a spacy bathroom with cold water. Every morning you get a bucket with warm water. Enough to take a shower.  The 'restaurant' is very basic but the food is very tastefull! You get a set meal with roti, rice, Dahl and two/three dishes with potatoes and vegetables (no meat, but that is also normal in this religious area). I regret not making pictures in the restaurant.  I think the beds are not cleaned that often, but I think you can't expect that much luxury in this area. And don't be afraid of some spiders or insect in",Lisanne-76,/Profile/Lisanne-76,"Culemborg, The Netherlands",30
rudraprayag,The camp is located a little away from the main city market but the view from the camp is absolutely spectacular. One can’t help but enjoy the beauty of nature here. Do for a stroll around the camp and you will see how beautiful and simple nature can be ,Srishti Misra,/Profile/srishtimisra,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",40
rudraprayag,Except location everything is just basic. Average food and accommodation.Swiss tents are maintained poorly. Insects are freely available inside tents. However views of the snow clad mountains are awesome.,MK S,/Profile/MKS194,,30
rudraprayag,"The camp offers views to die for . The place is very well connected by road. It is high up in the mountains and offers 180 degree of snow capped mountain views. The tents are not ordinary tents, they are luxury tents. They have nice washrooms with hot water. We enjoyed camp fire and the food was sumptuous served by amazingly ready to service staff. The bedding were clean and soft. The management must be very professional to provide such luxury in such a remote location. I thoroughly enjoyed looking at amazing scenery all around me and the constant landing and take off of helicopters ferrying pilgrims to Kedarnath. I visited Tungnath and Chandrashila one day and Devariataal next day. Amazing place for trekking as so many treks originate from this place",rajesh r,/Profile/rajeshr1919,,50
rudraprayag,Stayed here for two nights during Chardham yatra. This serves as a stop over to visit Kedarnath. Barkot has a tents with the same name (same owner) but this one is much better especially the location. The sleep quality is acceptable & food is fine as well (much better than any other place we stayed during Chardham yatra). They provide hot water in the morning (very small quantity) & if you need lunch you need to inform them in advance. The tent has a fan & acceptable beds. Recommend for its picturesque location & decent service. (I cannot rate very good & since there's no good I'm giving it an average).,Naveen Subbaiah,/Profile/navjyo08,"Fahaheel, Kuwait",30
rudraprayag,"Stayed from may 5 to 7. 2017. Location perfect on a mountain top, overlooking snow clad mountains and deep valleys. Stay good in cottages than in tents. All features one would expect in a 4 star hotel, available in cottages, including running hot water, hot water kettle, 24 hour food supply. Bonus picture post card views even from bed. Very near the helicpoter site at Guptkashi, so that you could hop in bed within five minutes of landing from Kedarnath.",vselvarajfca,/Profile/vselvarajfca,"Coimbatore, India",50
rudraprayag,"They have tents as well as condos and are situated in the amidst of nature with very nice scenic beauty. The location is little away around 3Kms from main road towards Kedarnath Dham, but the place is real gem. They have very nice garden maintained in and around the rooms with beautiful flowers that please the mind. The food served is always fresh and good. The staff is very polite and helpful. The cost is on expensive side.",Ashay R,/Profile/ashayr2016,"Mumbai, India",40

rudraprayag,A good place to stay though lacks some basic amenities like running hot water and a running restaurant.As it is located almost 3.5 kms away from the town you are dependent for food on the property.But overall a good place to relax and enjoy the nature.The staff is courteous.,ravi k,/Profile/ravik660,,40
rudraprayag,"These are nice Tents with good beds and attached full bath within every tent. The location is beautiful, at foothills of Himalayas, great location to enjoy nature, trek around.    The owner Mr.Rana is a welcoming person and was helpful conversing all the things we need to get around this area. The staff boys are simple (don't expect 5 star service), but were obliging if you engage them. The food - dinner buffet was pretty good (NOT cheap or crappy) and well made. Still i found the pricing about $55/night was on the higher side, but these are seasonal tourist spots. Being in a tent means, you will hear noises from neighbours...i got lucky with good neighbors :) , could be worse.

rudraprayag,"Mr agent fiend Mr.Dinesh Bharadwaj had booked this place for our night out on the way to Kedarnath during our very recent travel there this month ie.September 2015. On arriving late in the evening at around 8.30 pm , a slightly chilly and cold evening , we were shown our tent which contained a double bed , fan , charge point , an attached washroom  with basin , a small side table, two chairs and a well carpeted flooring. I must say that this was a unique and different experience more to our liking. It is not a hotel or resort or any building, but purely tenting with all the basics inside. It was clean and neat and very comfortable. The top marks were for the food services with the boys preparing excellent soup and salad first up followed by our order for mixed vegetables,  dal,",murli904,/Profile/murli904,"Mumbai, India",40

rudraprayag,"1. we stayed at camp Nirvana tent accommodation for a night of 6th, May,2015, as per the suggestion of our driver, we reached at the camp at about 5.30 in the evening---pretty late, only about half an hour of sunlight for the day! 2. The camp is at an altitude of about 1650 meters, which is pretty high!,also the nearest big town, Guptkashi is about 8 km , that too along the steep winding single vehicle road, so basically, there is no emergency service available. be warned, if you have any ailment or suffering for m short breath etc, better to stay near civilization! 3. There is a village of about 100 pucca houses 100 meters east, and also a helipad and other tented camps. The villagers are very nice to talk to, they all speak Hindi. most of the villagers have some farmland down",devbhoomi_yatri,/Profile/devbhoomi_yatri,"Allentown, Pennsylvania",30
rudraprayag,"Stayed here on the way to kedarnath, a good two hours away from kedarnath. Nice view of himalaya from this place, the accomodation is situated on a hill, so its high n cold. The same in this place, the room is carpeted, so stains and dust is on the floors. The bathroom floor is not tiled, so feels abit messy. The space around the camp gave me room to dry my rain soaked clothes, this couldnt be done if its in a normal hotel. The staffs were helpfull and polite, hot water provided upon request.

rudraprayag,"We missed the turning to an uphill and winding road to get to this place, after crossing the Guptkashi market and got really irritated out of fatigue. And then after 20-odd minuted of going round and round a hill dotted with small settlements, terraced fields, fruit trees and giggling children waving at our car, we finally breezed into this haven. White tents with flowers and shrubs all around, grassy slopes and stony steps, very warm and welcoming bunch of young lads who staff this Resort and a breathtaking sight of the Himalayas and that 4-faced gorgeous Chaukhamba peak right in front.

rudraprayag,"Camp Nirvana is located a little outside Guptkashi, on a hill-top. So you are almost guaranteed to have a much better view of the surrounding mountains from here than anywhere else in Guptkashi. We ourselves had some stunning views of snow-covered mountain peaks (in early September), which made for a beautiful backdrop while doing a bit of early-morning photography.  The camps are decent and good. It will help if they could improve the bathroom a little bit by plastering the floor to give it a more comfortable feel. The staff was extremely polite too. But they couldn't provide good quick service.  During our visit, the dining camp was not in use because there was some kind of a stink there that they were sorting out (this is what our driver later informed us).
