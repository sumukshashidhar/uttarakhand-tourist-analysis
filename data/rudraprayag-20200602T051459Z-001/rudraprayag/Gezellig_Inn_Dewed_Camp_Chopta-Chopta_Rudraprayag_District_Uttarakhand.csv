rudraprayag,"I went to winter Chandrashila trekking with my friends in February 2020 and stayed in Gezellig Inn - Dewed Camp. The tents are like heaven. We never visited such tents before. The staff and food was excellent. And the view from the camp is really superb. It is the nearest camp site to Chandrashila summit and Tungnath temple. So, I will recommended it to everyone visiting to Chopta.",Vishal,/Profile/HardCoreTravel,,50

rudraprayag,"I reached Gezellig Inn - Dewed Camp Chopta on 2nd January 2020 and got surprised to saw Raghav Juyal staying there with his friends. I was completely shocked by that moment to see him in front of me.  Then we had dinner together in the dining hall. After dinner, I enjoyed the conversation with Raghav. We clicked some selfies with him.  Next day, in the early morning we did breakfast and went to the Tungnath track with Raghav Juyal and his friends. I really had amazing experience that day.  If Raghav could stay at Gezellig Inn - Dewed Camp Chopta, then anyone shouldn't doubt on the Quality of this Camp. The staff is very kind and humble. The service is extremely good and the food is simple but tasty.  This is one of the best Camp I've ever visited in my life. The Swiss tents are",Fathima,/Profile/Fathima49,"New Delhi, India",50
