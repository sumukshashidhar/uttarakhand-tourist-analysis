rudraprayag,We stopped here for lunch on the way to Tungnath trek. Food was amazing. Every dish we ordered was cooked perfectly. So on the way back we stopped for breakfast as well and that was amazing too. Highly recommended.,Pankaj M,/Profile/487pankajm,,50
rudraprayag,"This resort is 10 kms away from Rudraprayag. Rooms are clean as well as toilets. Rooms are very specious. Hotel staffs are very good. You can have food from restaurant, its very good in taste . You can halt here during your mid way visit Badrinath or kedarnath.",Arya,/Profile/AryaOl,"New Delhi, India",50
rudraprayag,"Sheetal Resort is a small facility with six rooms but large open space which is an exception in mountains. No traffic jams, No parking issues or stray cows, no pigeon hole rooms, I repeat its an exception in terms of open space. The rooms need prompt housekeeping though. The restaurant  which is a separate unit in the resort serves fresh food. Mr. Bisht, the manager knows the basics of hospitality. One of the best options for overnight stay on way to Barinath or Kedarnath.",Mountain_Shepherds,/Profile/Mountain_Shepherds,"Auli, India",40
rudraprayag,"During my stay at the resort , I felt satisfied physically and spiritually due to its location in the serene surrounding nature and the excellent service of hospitality by the management and staff. I really bet that such kind of facility and wonderful experience one cannot have within such a budgeted category any where else.",sanjayjoshi2015,/Profile/sanjayjoshi2015,"Dehradun, India",40
rudraprayag,"perched atop a hillock and right adjacent to the road leading to rudraprayag this is a quaint and beautiful place to do a stopover before the journey to the gods..(badrinath, hemkunt, kedarnath).  Since this place is before the rudraprayag town hence the noise, crowds, pollution is zero.  We stayed in a large family room on our journey to badrinath right before the deluge that hit uttarakhand and had a wonderful experience.  The ganges (not actually though as its complete only after devprayag once it meets the bhagirati) was flowing right below the resort and we spent our leisure strolling the beautiful gardens and listening to the melodious tune of the river.  Food was average, but prepared with heart and service was superb with all thanks to the manager   Would always ensure",nvnl,/Profile/nvnl,"New Delhi, India",40
rudraprayag,I went on my yearly excursion in Rudraprayag even this year.  All i can say is that my overall experience of this hotel has been fantastic and unequal. Manger and employees there  are very cooperative and owner is a Gem to deal with.  The best part was that it is surrounded by hill on one side and river on another side - feeling of being one with nature!!  I certainly have high praises for this property.,yymamgain,/Profile/yymamgain,Dehradun,50
rudraprayag,We were on our way to Kausani and it was getting night. We took this resort as we saw this as the first resort near Rudraprayag. Just on the road.  Resort is just OK. Not chick but good for night halt. We got 4 bedded room at decent price. The room had AC so we had nice sleep. Food was OK.,kulwinderg,/Profile/kulwinderg,"Chandigarh, India",30
