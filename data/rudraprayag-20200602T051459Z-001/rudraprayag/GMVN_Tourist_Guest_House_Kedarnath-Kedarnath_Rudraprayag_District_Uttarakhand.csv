The room had not of dampness and fungus  due to rains.The toilet had huge mount of clutter (including cigarette buds ) which we got cleaned. The linen and blankets too were old and stained.

rudraprayag,Stayed here on 29 May after 13 hours tiresome trek. We booked Swargarohini cottage which has two adjacent rooms with total 4 bunk beds. In such high altitude the cottage is good with warm inside and sufficient beddings. There was no power cut during our stay and warm water was always available. The cottage is beside the Helipad and Temple is 1 km. away. Now the cons are: The facility of room heater is now not available and then there is no separate arrangement of food for boarders at the Annapurna restaurant which made us stand in long queue at night with outsiders to have food coupons.

In fact, in all three pilgrimage centres (Badrinath, Kedarnath and Gangotri), the GMVN accomodation is very basic and much poorer than their accomodation in the realtively lower altitude (plains) areas (e.g. Rudraprayag, Syalsaur).  The best thing about the GMVN guest house is its location: practically next to the temple, but everything else is a minus. Rooms are grotty, no heating, no hot water..you practically freeze at night : but I guess you have to endure some hardship when you want to get close to God?!  Also, bear in mind , there are not too many options at Kedarnath.",partha2504,/Profile/partha2504,"Mumbai, India",20
rudraprayag,"The hotel is not in good shape. No Geyser. Heater not working in any room, furniture so old and trashy that I didnt even touch. Temperatures in off season can be very cold, so you will pay Rs160 for single coal shekdi to warm you up... cant use it in the room. Check for broken glass in windows. Half of them have broken glass which can bring down the temperatures in the room. I was told you may have to pay Rs30 for a bucket of hot water to bathe. I didnt hear anyone in our group paying for it eventually. The restaurant is okay, It is now run by the son of a good cook. Some complained that the tea and food was horrible. When we stayed there was no electricity in town for the entire night. The generators stop working after some time. So take a flashlight(torch) with you.",GhumnaPhirna,/Profile/GhumnaPhirna,"Austin, Texas",10
