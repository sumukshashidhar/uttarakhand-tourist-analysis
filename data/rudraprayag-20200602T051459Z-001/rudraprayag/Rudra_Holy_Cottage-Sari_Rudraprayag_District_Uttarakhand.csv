rudraprayag,"Totally unprofessional owner, Joydeep Negi. I have booked for two days, 4th to 6th October. After giving advance he will not give you any receipt. After repeatedly asking him he has given me a receipt where no date was given. Next when I reached sari he told me that the booking is for only 5th October. Next after showing him the WhatsApp message he agreed to give room but surprisingly after shifting a couple from our room to some other hotel and cleaning the room on that moment. The big cheating we faced next day, when he misguided us about the tourplan and then forced us to shift chopta. But the actual reason we came to know that a group of people again booked from that day. Please don't believe Joydeep Negi, he is totally fraud. If possible I would like to give here negative",DBP,/Profile/Experience511217,,10
