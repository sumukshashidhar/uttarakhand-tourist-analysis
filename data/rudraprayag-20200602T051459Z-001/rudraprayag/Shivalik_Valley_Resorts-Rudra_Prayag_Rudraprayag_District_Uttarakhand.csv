rudraprayag,"The hotel is okay considering the location to be a hilly terrain.The day we went, it was a bit cramped may be because of the season. The restaurant had Andhra food and north Indian food.

rudraprayag,Stayed here for a night on way to Kedarnath. The rooms are good with modern equipments. But let us tell you about our experience on entering the hotel. We booked an Executive room online but they offered us a Super Deluxe room which was lower in price and space. Actually we saw they were giving the rooms at higher prices to guests because of huge tourist rush. When we complained they shifted us to our original room. One should be alert before taking room here. The food in the hotel are tasty but very costly.,201411pp,/Profile/201411pp,"Naihati, West Bengal, India",40

Hot water is available as the geyser is fitted inside, may not be sufficient if all want to take bath at once. Food in the restaurant is very good, But not much options in Breakfast. So breakfast is very average. Service and the staffs are very good. This is just 1 hour from Gaurikund from where the Kedarnath yatra on horse, Dholi or by walk starts.

The senior manager Mr. Rajkumar is one of the true gentlemen I have ever come across. We got stuck on the kedarnath high way due to landslides. He drove 20 km in his car to come and pick us up.

Later we came to know that they dont allow horsed to commence ascend from Gaurikund post 2 pm so we have to search for hotels , we checked out 3 to 4 hotels at Sonprayag and perhaps this one was the best one but let me tell you given the amenities provided it was very very high charges that hotel was asking per night ~4100 per night .

rudraprayag,Location - 3-4 kms before Kedarnath trek starts. If you are planning to stay in a decent place in Gaurikund then you won't find any. This is the only option. Also there are some good hotels in front of it.   Food - They don't offer room service. There buffet is good. Breakfast for Rs. 180 and Meal - Rs. 350 i guess. Food was good but delayed service even in the buffet. Try their Dosa! Its was yummy!   Staff - Staff was polite.   Rooms - Rooms were spacious with running hot water.

They survive this as the customers are too tired to talk about it and eat whatever that comes their way. Trust me barring the Idli in the breakfast I did not savour anything.

However there is lack of coordination between front desk, reception and kitchen, service desk and so on.
