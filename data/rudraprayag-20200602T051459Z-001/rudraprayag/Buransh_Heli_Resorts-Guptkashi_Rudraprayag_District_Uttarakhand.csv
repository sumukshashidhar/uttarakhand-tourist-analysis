rudraprayag,Nice location on the helipad..Rooms are comfortable.Staff is very helpful and courteous..but one problem is  rooms not available on Room only basis ...Only MAP based rooms available.. taking this option is a waste of money because early morning 6 am you board the helicopter and their breakfast timings are from 7:30 or 8 am...,Appushal,/Profile/Appushal,,40

rudraprayag,I stayed in this resort along with my spouse for two nights (14th & 15th MAY 2019) on our way to kedarnath shrine.The Resort is a little over 4 kms from main Guptkashi. The resort is situated in the midst of the Himalayan range. The resort has a beautiful la land-scape with roses all round. It has its own helipad from where the helicopter services to Kedarnath operated off by the Arrow Helicopter agency. It is therefore a boon to the pilgrims to reach the shrine through helicopters.  The surrounding is very beautiful with snow capped ranges and the lush green mountains. The restaurant of the resort serves very decent food. Food is included in the room rent.The services of the staff at the restaurant and other areas are worth praising. The Manager Mr.Navlesh is very well behaved,EASWARCHANDRAN,/Profile/EASWAR52,"Mumbai, India",40

rudraprayag,The Resort is close to Guptkashi and yet away from the town amidst the himalayan range. The helicopter service to Kedarnath takes off from this resort which has a helipad for the Arrow Helicopter agency. The surrounding is beautifull with a view of the snow capped ranges and the lush green mountains surrounding this resort. The restaurant serves decent food. the staff at the restaurant renders good service. Being away from the town personal transport is essential.,Nilma S,/Profile/nilmas2017,"Mumbai, India",40

It is ideal location to aged person who are willing to take Chopper for  kedarnath, make sure you are carrying confirmed tickets.",Inder V,/Profile/inderv2014,,40
rudraprayag,"This is the best property in Guptkashi. The staff is extremely courteous , especially Mr. Paritosh , who sees to it that the stay is comfortable. The property has an amazing view and best part is the helipad that is within the premises. So if you plan to go to Kedarnath dham via helicopter then Buransh Heli is the ideal hotel for you as helipad is just few mtrs from your room . The atmosphere is serene and food is delicious . My parents stayed there for 2 days and they had an amazing experience. Thank you for the hospitality !",Mitali A,/Profile/MitaliA24,,50
rudraprayag,"It's very difficult to get good accommodation anywhere near Kedarnath but this place really exceeds expectations. The view from Buransh is unmatched and it's so easy to just catch the chopper from right outside your room. Everywhere else in Guptkashi, the helipads are right on the road and it gets quite chaotic. But Buransh is really changing that scenario. The staff is very helpful too and the rooms are very comfortable. ",Sukhmani W,/Profile/SukhmaniW3,,50
