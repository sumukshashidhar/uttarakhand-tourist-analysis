rudraprayag,Had an absolutely delightful stay at Cafe Buransh.  Randeep and Rajani from the Buransh team made the stay so comfortable and welcome.  The place and people are very warm and welcoming.  Absolutely stunning views from your room and from the restaurant.  This place is en-route  Deoria tal,NandanM,/Profile/NandanM,"Singapore, Singapore",50
rudraprayag,"We visited Cafe Buransh in December 2019.Rajani Muralidharan, who owns the place, was super helpful from the bookings to letting us know the weather and road travel tips! The manager and caretaker at Buransh, Rakesh and Sunder are a fine example of Pahadi hospitality. Ever smiling and always ready to accommodate any request we would make. The food is made by Rakesh at the hotel itself and is a delicious affair. Do try his Special Malta Salad! The rooms are very comfortable as well as rustic. Right in front, from the patio, you have the entire valley's view and snow capped peaks, including Chandrashila. We could stare forever. Best place to stay near Chopta. Lots of places to sightsee nearby. Paradise for birders. Would be back soon for sure!",Armaan Pandey,/Profile/armaandoc,,50
rudraprayag,"Amazing place to stay in the lap of nature, just 300 m from Sari village on the way to Deoria Tal. Rooms were nice with all facilities.  Rajani (the owner) was very helpful and friendly. Very courteous staff, Rakesh and Suraj took very good care of us.  Food was homely and delicious. They also prepared home made chocolate ice cream, that was yum too ! Overall a perfect vacation home. Would definitely recommend this place. ",Amit J,/Profile/Amitjain87,"Faridabad, India",50

rudraprayag,"Café Buransh is an idyllic place tucked up a short winding path from Sari village. Rajni was the perfect host and her staff were excellent. It allows you relax completely, however it will not suit everyone as it's luxury doesn't consist of fixtures and fittings or home comforts. It's a peaceful hideaway with basic accommodation which can get cold in the winter months. The food is simple and cooked from local resources, dal and roti, and generally vegetarian. We fell in love with the tranquil beauty of the place. Thank you.",zarniwoop,/Profile/zarniwoop,"Thame, United Kingdom",50
rudraprayag,We loved our stay at Cafe Buransh. The 15 minutes steep climb was worth it. We enjoyed the view and the solitude that the place offered. The rooms are comfortable and the food we ordered was just perfect for the cold weather. We would love to go back.,Flyer08705051717,/Profile/Flyer08705051717,,50
rudraprayag,"The facility is located up the mountain, 10 mins walk from the main road, on the way to Deoria Tal lake (1.4km). The cafe is perfectly positioned in the middle of the mountains all around, rendering a picturesque view from the rooms.  I was here for 5 days (Oct 11 to 16, 2018) and my stay was exceptionally satisfying. I couldn't have asked for more. Personally the most important aspect for me as a traveler, is a clean and tidy room to stay. Cafe Buransh offers a cosy and beautifully arranged room with high standards. You will not find any facility around Sari, similar to this. The dining and recreational area is worth the mention. It is very well designed to give the pleasures of dining and having fun in close quarters with nature. A magnificent view awaits you. A warm and",Biju M B,/Profile/BijuB,"Bengaluru, India",50
rudraprayag,Situated on Sari Village to Deoria Taal trek about 10 minutes walkable distance. Beautiful and pleasant location and very cooperative staff. The only shortcoming is that they have limited water. They have to transport water via pony or labourer. If you have kids then you may feel shortage of water otherwise it is very beautiful and only reputed restaurant of that area. You will definitely enjoy here.,JASVINDER1981,/Profile/JASVINDER1981,"Panipat, India",40
rudraprayag,"In a place where good hotels are hard to come by Cafe Buransh comes as a whiff of fresh air. It is located strategically on the way to Deoriatal.  We used their services for a couple of nights' camping at Chopta....that was wonderfully arranged.  Once we were done with the camping we moved over to the hotel. To be able to provide all the modern amenities at such a remote location aint easy but these guys just pull it off.  Don't go there expecting the whole world, and you will not come back disappointed.  It is a very small place- just 4 rooms and a very welcoming restaurant. Be warned- you have to climb quite a bit to reach there. The staff is great...sunder n rakesh r just awesome...the hosts r good company too.",BN Karthik,/Profile/131karthikk,"Mumbai, India",50
rudraprayag,"A cosy little B&B tucked into the mountain side on the trek up to Deorital. Its just a 4 room property and the rooms where we stayed are done up in rustic style and aptly called Pahadi rooms. The beds are comfortable and linen is clean. The washroom thankfully shifts from rural to modern and is very clean. We made this our base camp to trek to Deorital and Tunganath/Chandrashila and that was a good move, as we could rest our tired bodies at this abode and be taken care of by Rakesh, Vipin and Sundar - they cooked us some tasty food, hot water , tea on demand and snacks - all and anything with a big smile Rajani and Randeep - co-owners were a joy to chat and deal with and I would highly recommend this little home away from home",Sathyam R,/Profile/sravoor,Chennai,50
rudraprayag,"Sari Village is a popular destination for Deoriatal trek, a beautiful village nestled in the mountains. This quaint village has a handful of staying options. Most people stay in Ukhimath, 15km from Sari. My initial plan was the same until I stumbled upon Cafe Buransh. Here's what I love about this place: a. The cafe is located a 400 meters uphill walk on the trail towards Deoriatal trek.  b. It is isolated from the village but offers the complete view of Sari Village from top. The best part is the 180 degree view of the valley and the mountains c. They have only 4 rooms which great for people who do not prefer a crowd. Offers a perfect solitude. d. It has an outhouse cafe where you can sit overlooking the mountains. Also has a good collection of books for those who prefer to",The_Allegorist,/Profile/The_Allegorist,"Mumbai, India",50
rudraprayag,As soon as you start your ascend from Sari Village for Deorital Trek you come across Cafe Buransh.. One can stop here either before starting with the Trek or while coming down as well..

rudraprayag,"Excellent stay and hospitality. Amazing views from the hotel room.... The rooms are very tastefully done and indeed a luxury considering the harsh terrain.

rudraprayag,"Cafe Buransh is an amazing little hotel on the trek up to Deoria Tal. It is a small hotel with just 4 rooms and a dining/common area. It is run by a group of friends from Kerala, who fell in love with the region when they came trekking here.  We drove up to Deoria Tal from Gurgaon. Leaving at 3am from Gurgaon, we stopped right after Roorkee for breakfast at a roadside dhaba. A few more loo breaks later and we reached Saari Village at 3pm. We drove up the Delhi-Meerut-Rishikesh-Haridwar-Devprayag route. The roads are largely quite good. Only few patches post Rishikesh were a problem where previous landslides, which are a feature of the Garhwal region, had damaged the roads. We had called the property while crossing Ukimath and they had sent someone down to the motor-able road to",YBNormal78,/Profile/YBNormal78,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
rudraprayag,"For Deoriatal, we stayed ‘Home Stay’  ""Café Buransh"". We were there from 25/09/17 and 26/09/17 night. I stayed there with my wife and son. Very nice place to stay.   The property is situated 300-400m away from Saari Village on the same walking route towards Deoriatal. In steep terrain, when you go towards Deoriyatal in early morning to see Sunrise, reduce of 300-400m walk maters a lot.   At Café Buransh, hospitality was amazing. They are maintaining proper facility to called “Home Stay”. There is a lovely view of a valley available from the front of all rooms. Available Foods and Facilities like rooms, washrooms, kitchen, dining room etc, are really to be appreciated on high grade for this terrain. They have a very high sense of decoration keeping eco-friendly use. The reception",pramatheshsaha,/Profile/pramatheshsaha,"Noida, India",50
rudraprayag,"Amazing place to stay amidst nature! Lovely and great first impression!! Excellent view of Sari Village from the dining area and the rooms!! The best place you could be in if you want to trek to Deoriatal, The view in the morning is a treat to the eyes from Cafe Buransh as it is surrounded with snow clad mountains. The rooms are very clean, neat, and tidy. Admirable service by the chef and the housekeeping! Made us feel comfortable and at home! Amazing and friendly owners! They also helped us with our trek to Tunghnath and Chandrashila peak. And for the book lovers, they have good collection of books you could read if you just want to sit back and relax. Overall and unforgettable experience.  We would love to visit again!!",Shriti M,/Profile/ShritiM1,,50
rudraprayag,"Cafe Buransh is a fantastic place that is nestled right in the heart of the mountains. The best part about the hotel is it's location as it is right on the trail to Deoriatal lake - so just a five minute climb upstairs to get to the place - but once the climb is made then one can see why it is where it is at. The hotel offers a view of the entirety of Sari Village while mountains tower above on all sides, it is also flanked by lush green fields. On cloudy mornings - one can see the clouds at eye level, slowly moving in from the Chandrashila Peak(also clearly visible from Cafe Buransh) which makes for an extremely surreal picture post card memory. The cloud formation snaking in and out of the mountains at all times is truly a marvel to behold.   The rooms are functional, clean",Vignesh I,/Profile/VigneshI26,,40
