rudraprayag,"This is a very basic hotel and no luxury can be expected here. This hotel is suitable for those travellers who want to enjoy the tranquility of nature and can stay disconnected from the rest of the world. Rooms are very basic and washrooms are okay but definitely not great. Food is tasty but the staffs should be informed well before to get lunch, dinner and breakfast.There will not be much option for food. They provide hot water once in a day, anything extra is chargeable. There is absolutely no mobile network, not even BSNL. Please be prepared for that. This is a forest area and quite remote. Considering the location, I would say this is a noce option to stay in Chopta for Tunganath Chandrashila trek. Please think again for this option if you are travelling with babies.

rudraprayag,"In a place with scarcity of electricity, run on solar energy, the care takers do a wonderful job of providing everything you need. They are humble and helpful, and make delicious North Indian meals. The stay is comfortable, has all basic necessities, and is a small meadow-like place, with a tiny Brook running by. Thank you so much guys!",Ava,/Profile/Themountainnomad,,50
rudraprayag,"We stayed at Mayadeep Resort Chopta for two nights in May this year, and greatly enjoyed our stay. It’s a clean and convenient option for all types of travellers. The staff are incredibly helpful and go out of their way to ensure your comfort. The food was healthy, tasty and hearty - just what we needed after long and tiring days of trekking in the Chopta region. I would definitely recommend it, if you’re staying in this region :) ",Veda Singh,/Profile/borrowedream,"Bengaluru, India",40
rudraprayag,"I traveled with my friends from Delhi to Chopta on 19th April, I took around 16 hours in car due to road construction and stayed at Mayadeep hotel. Mayadeep is the only hotel available and there are other staying options as well but in a camp or bamboo cottage which might not be a good idea as it's pretty cold even in April. Staff is good and helping. They have rooms with 2 double beds in it which can accommodate 5 people at once.  One thing to highlight is food which is good and tasty but little bit on higher side comparing to dhabas just above Mayadeep hotel but those dhabas won't serve you any lunch or dinner as they have knots with Mayadeep hotel and they cook for them and serve in hotel at higher prices. You can try moving towards Tungnath tracking and on roadside you get",Shakun S,/Profile/ShakunS14,,30

rudraprayag,"This is not really a resort, just a pocket-friendly hotel. We stayed for just one night (arriving late) and didn't get much of a chance to appreciate the view. The place is relatively isolated and peaceful. We went in winter and it was very cold. Electricity goes out after 9 PM, and there was no arrangement for room heating. The room itself was fine, big in size and with a comfortable bed. The food is also good, particularly because the cook asks exactly how you would the dish to be cooked. But other than that the staffs seemed reluctant to talk or work and the manager was not present that day. The worst part though was the entrance. The main entrance got blocked with snow and the road the staffs took us through (which enters on the first-floor balcony) was extremely slippery",UshashiB,/Profile/UshashiB,"Kolkata, India",30
rudraprayag,"It is a standard pocket friendly hotel. The staff was very cooperative and polite. Loved the hospitality and deliciously made food. While the rooms aren't equipped with luxury but they are good enough and NEATLY managed. At a remote location like Chopta which has scarce resources, this hotel is definitely a great choice. Five stars to the staff :) We were lucky enough to witness the snowfall here!",Sudarshan Mishra,/Profile/sudmishra19,,50
rudraprayag,"I stayed here for three days to do a nearby hike. This resort is like a bed and breakfast. Considering it’s in a very rural location, amenities are simple, however it has everything you need for a clean and comfortable stay. The food is cooked in the kitchen downstairs, and is delicious. Service is attentive and hospitable. Mr Deepak organised a great guide for my hike and transfers to the nearest public transport. I was thrilled with my experience there. I’d highly recommend it.",Erin K T,/Profile/93erinkt,,50
rudraprayag,"Mayadeep resort I must say it’s not a resort it’s a hotel with 3 huts, rooms are ok beddings are also ok but I must say service is good, food is also good, staff is welcoming and yes the owner of this resort Mr Deepak is informative person informed about the location and other important things in advance so it was like a nice experience overall it’s a must to visit place...",Manish Chaudhri,/Profile/manishc361,"Haldwani, India",40
rudraprayag,"I stayed with my family during Durga Puja week. The hotel was full, yet so peaceful. Staff was good, doing their best in such a remote location, where there is no electricity. But this was the best stay I experienced. Lovely Meadows, streams flowing, flying birds and on top that amazing food.",PC S,/Profile/979pcs,,50
rudraprayag,"Did Tungnath-Chandrashila trek with family last week...stayed at Mayadeep Duggalbitta for 3 nights. Location is great with a valley view and a stream running nearby. You can do birding by just sitting in the common area on the first floor. Rooms are basic but with good ambience. As expected, there is no light in this area since it's a part of Kedarnath WLS, I personally like such places since you feel closer to mother nature,had same experience in KMVN Binsar as well. There is always a scope for improvement so food options can certainly be looked at by the management. Folks at the hotel are very prompt in service and are always ready to help you in every possible manner. I would love to come back here whenever that happens. Keep up the good work guys.",Ashish Singh,/Profile/ashishsingh1984,"New Delhi, India",40

It was indeed a lovely resort with all basic facilities, neat and clean, good staff and excellent food. The resort offers an incredible panaromic view.Its an eco property very close to the nature.

rudraprayag,"I went to Mayadeep herbal resort a few days back and was mesmerized by the location, its so beautiful. It makes you feel like you are in a valley and the entire Himalayan range is watching you. Stunning!!! The rooms are super clean, staff is very cordial and simple (always smiling) and the food is so homely, you don't feel like being outside. Would highly rate this property to environment friendly travelers who love nature over anything else. Serenity is supreme luxury and Mayadeep offers just that!",Ravi K,/Profile/RaviK4084,,50
rudraprayag,"Our plan was to stay at Kanakchouri, Deoriataal and Duggalvita. In all these three locations, we booked through euttaranchal (Ms. Anjali Rawat). We stayed at Mayadeer Herbal Resort at Kanakchouri and Mayadeep resort at Duggalvita, Chopta. In both cases, we found the property very well maintained with very co-operative staffs. Especially, the caretaker Mr. Satya Singh Rawat at Mayadeep, Chopta is an excellent chef and whatever he prepared for us was absolute treat and delicious. We overall liked both properties very well and definitely recommend to people visiting there.",Anupam K,/Profile/AnupamK26,,50

rudraprayag,Maya Deep resort is a great place with good budget and nice hospitality. We booked 2 BambooCottage rooms during our Visit to Chopta (March 2018) This place is easily accessible and away from crowds. Staffs were very friendly and ready for any help.   Service is good.  *  Room is good and clean.  *  Location is amazing you can see the high mountains and green       medows near your rooms.  *  in your budget it is the best hotel.,Ashish M,/Profile/AshishM1492,,40
rudraprayag,"Located in scenic environs, Mayadeep herbal resort was a rejuvenating experience for the mountain and snow lover. We travelled in a group 5 during what was the best time to visit the Himalayas for snow, January. The resort fed our eyes and hearts with breath-taking views. What made the trip even more memorable was the excellent hospitality and service offered to us at the resort. Although we only had a short stay, it left us in a transcendental and tranquil state of mind. I would positively and strongly recommend Mayadeep resort for anyone travelling to this region for a stay that'll remain etched in the memories meant to last for a lifetime..Complementing the ambience was Mr. Deepak s pleasant and accommodating nature that helped us organise our entire vacation and travel",Deepesh D,/Profile/DeepeshD33,,40

rudraprayag,"We had booked two rooms with 4 Bed and 5 Bed each. Both the rooms were spacious, clean and well maintained. The owner was happy to reduce the rent for one bed, as we had one person short than anticipated.  Food was average, especially we didn't liked the Chapaties as those were not made up from 100% Wheat. However, looking at the remoteness of the place, can't complain.  Also no food is available for Lunch. Only Dinner is prepared as per our order. However, a nearby Restaurant is available just at 50 meters distance.  Limited hot water is provided in Buckets for Bathing in the morning.  The entire region doesn't have electricity supply, and the electricity is available only from 7:30 to 10:00 PM through Diesel Gen Sets, however, they do provide Solar Lanterns, which are more",Vilas W,/Profile/Vilas_bw,"Pune, India",40

rudraprayag,Stayed 2 nights after a trek to Deoriatal and Chandrashila.. Idea was to relax without any rush what so ever and do some birding. The resort served great food and the bird species we saw from the grounds was great. They helped with a birding guide and even a bike ride to Chopta.

rudraprayag,"This hotel is located at Duggal Vitta, a small hamlet between Ukhimath & Chopta.  We had to walk down around 100 m from the Ukimath-Chopta-Gopeswar Road  to reach the hotel .Porters were sent from the hotel to carry our luggage.  I stayed at the main building. This is a small  hotel with basic amenities in a remote place and suitable for  an overnight stay. Small & dark rooms, ordinary bed & blankets,running cold water in western style toilets, hot water supplied in bucket, electricity from 7pm to 10 pm, steaming hot ordinary Indian food, tea-coffee and cordial staff ---don't expect anything more.

rudraprayag,"Back from the trip yesterday and already missing this place. We stayed in the Bamboo cottage. This hotel is far away from commercialization and that's what make it a perfect stay in the lapse of nature. The cottage has all the basic amenities. Hot water is provided. Service is very good. Hotel staff is very friendly, Pradeep, the cook cum caretaker is very nice person. Food is delicious, same as home made.  In the night, we had bonfire and the sky is so full of stars. Even you can easily notice a moving star. Do not remember when was the last time I had seen such a starry night.   Want to add that this place is not for those who are looking for a luxurious stay.

However we were delighted to find the locals helpful in carrying our luggage down the lane towards the resort from the main road. A very helpful young manager of the resort was Amit bhaiya who escorted, guided and helped us in every possible way during our entire trip. The double-bedroom was small but cosy, water was chilled, mobile networks were zero and the most exciting thing about this resort was the experience it offers to you. If you are someone who is looking forward to a real break from the fast and entangled urban life, this is the ultimate destination.

rudraprayag,"Mayadeep has been a perfect example of what a website can achieve for you. After being severely misguided by the hotel website - I prebooked this hotel but when I arrived at the hotel, all my notions turned to dust.   The hotel is located about 8 KMs before Chopta. The entrance is a dirt road which could easily be made into a proper metal 1-strip road by the owner, but clearly that is not a concern of the owner. I must make it clear that there is no GOVT electricity in the entire Chopta area which is a shock. I'm not sure why the Govt is not taking steps to bring power into the area esp. when it's close to Tungnath, which is visited by 1000s of tourists. All villagers I met in Chopta were complaining about the power problem. My stay was in first week of June, 2012.  Hotel Room:",folkpoet80,/Profile/folkpoet80,"Mountain View, California",10
