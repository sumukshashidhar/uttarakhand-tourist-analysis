rudraprayag,"This hotel is very well managed and the service was great. The views are awe-inspiring. The majestic KedarNath ranges are visible along with Chaukhamba from this venue. Food was excellent. The management and staff work hard to maintain this location and they never tire from providing good service like preparing chai ad-hoc throughout the day, fixing appliances if needed and go to great lengths to making sure we are comfortable. Highly recommended.   we were very well looked after by Mr Joshi ji, who was ever so calm and composed and provided great help and assistance and service",Alok,/Profile/alokt921,"London, United Kingdom",50
rudraprayag,"A well maintained property at an amazing location far from the crowd and noise. Good food, would like to visit again and spend at least couple of days. Good place for bird watching and hiking. Amazing view of snow peaked mountains through out the year.",Avid_trotter,/Profile/Avid_trotter,"Houston, Texas",50
rudraprayag,The Village Retreat is a beautiful cozy resort tucked into the hills around Gupt Kashi. It is about 5 km away from the hustle and bustle of the town. The Gupt Kashi helipads for Kedarnath Darshan are located about 2 km away. Phata helipads are about 15 km. The resort staff is great and helpful. The resort is clean. Rooms are big and clean bathrooms. The food is great. The view from the dining area and Portico outside is mind blowing. You can see the Himalayan range spread across the sky line. While this is a fantastic place to stay for Kedarnath Yatra it is also awesome for leisure.,Harishuv29,/Profile/Harishuv29,"Mumbai, India",50
