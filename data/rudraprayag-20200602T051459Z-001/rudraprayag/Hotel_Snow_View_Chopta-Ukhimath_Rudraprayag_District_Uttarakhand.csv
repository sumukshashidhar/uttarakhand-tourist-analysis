rudraprayag,"All though this hotel is bit away from Chopta but it is a charming place run by very nice people. The view from this hotel is awesome. I didn't notice any good hotel near Chopta bus stand, it is quite crowded too.  There is no electricity here, it is a solar powered place. They switch on the lights only after 7 PM and turn off at 10 PM. So charge your phone etc. during this time. They provide candles but I suggest that through out your tour in the mountains keep a thick candle with you.",pagol2005,/Profile/pagol2005,India,40
rudraprayag,"three of our friends stayed there during Oct, 2012.  Though its going to be seven years, my memory gets stuck up the view of valley below the hotel.  Very small Hotel.  with wonderful landscape view.  Even from the entire road, its having  a clear view.  We didnt have our own car, but the hotel manager, helped us.  He dropped us to Tunganath trek, next day to Deoria Tal, and to Ukimath.   Whatever variety they could cook, they served us. Wonderful experience..  Having tea at the terrace was unforgettable exp.",NIRMALA,/Profile/nimmi-mdu,"Madurai, India",50
rudraprayag,"Best hotels to stay at Chopta. Rooms are of reasonable size, clean and with balconies. View from all the rooms are excellent. U can also have your meals in an open space adjacent to reception area to thoroughly njoy nature. From the room, you can hear beautiful chirping of birds and u can also spot some of the best birds of Uttarakhand.

rudraprayag,"Most hotels cater to tourists and less to photographers and birders. In Chopta valley, close to Pothibasa there is Snow View Resort. We stayed here for 2 nights, a very clean and nice place with all basic necessity available for a nature traveler.  Being in the forest zone, there is no electricity, they run on generator from 6PM to 11PM and beyond this you are on night lantern. Being in nature, you wont feel necessity of fan or AC as the temperature during our visit was 4C. Coming to food, they prepare decent food in their traditional style in wood fired chulas. They are also willing to try our options if we suggest any. But remember not to put excessive demands as they dont get many items delivered on time being on high altitude. Staff is extremely polite and their owner",MKamath,/Profile/MKamath,"Bengaluru, India",40

rudraprayag,"We had a 'jumbo' team, comprising 28 students of my Department plus we the six teachers and staff to stay here during September, 2017. Our journey to Chopta with such voluptuous team couldn't be so planned and comfortable except that person - Mr. Rajib Bajoria, the manager of Hotel Snow View. He (1) provided rooms in his hotel; (2) helped arranging bus that transported us from Haridwar to Chopta at the cost which I couldn't find after perpetual negotiation to different travel agents at Haridwar or Dehradun; (3) made plan for local sight seeing as our visit to Chopta was not only meant for trekking to Tungnath or Deoriatal rather we went with one more project to collect soil and biomass sample from sub-alpine grasslands.

rudraprayag,"It was indeed a real adventure to tour alone on Public Transport to Ukhimath from Kotdwar to Pauri to Srinagar to Rudraprayag & Kund, an unusual route will attract an avid tourist. From Kund, one should avail vehicles en route to Ukhimath & Chopta. Ukhimath is the winter abode of Lord Kedarnath. Small Hotels, GMVN TRH & Bharat Sebasram Sangha are palces to stay. Ukhimath was devastated in Aug,2010 flood with number of Sanyasis went missing or dead. BSS runs a school & I had the pleasure to meet Mr Asish Chakraborti, a Physics teacher at BSS School.

rudraprayag,"Meera, Joan and I, a middle-aged trio, decided to embrace adventure before our bones got brittle and rickety! Lo and behold, with the the help of Arvind and Nataraj of Crimson tours, we decided on a two-day trek in the Chamoli district of the Gharwal (pronounced ghad-wal) region of Uttarakhand. We flew out of Bangalore early on the 22nd morning to arrive at Delhi, from where we caught a connecting flight to Dehradun, and taxied it out to Rishikesh,18 kms away.   What struck me as immediately was that no one spoke English, right from the Delhi airport, and that was a shocker for a southerner like me, who spoke not even rudimentary Hindi. Luckily for us, Meera speaks Hindi like a native (Joan is Oz), so we were able to get by splendidly.  After an evening spent along the banks of",ShobaPeters,/Profile/ShobaPeters,"Bengaluru, India",40
rudraprayag,"We came to know about Hotel Snow View of Chopta Valley from Internet. We stayed at this Hotel in Mid December'16 for two days. We had communicated the owner and s per his advise transferred one day's rent to his amount. No receipt ws received from the Hotel but they verbally confirmed the booking. Once we reached there, we were simply overwhelmed by the hospitality of the owner and his team. A young man with a degree in Hotel Management is running the Hotel at a remote place where there is no electricity. Electricity through Generator is available from 6PM to 10PM everyday. They will supply hot water whenever needed. They had supplied hot water bags to each boarder in night. Food was very good considering the limited resources.

rudraprayag,"We have stayed there in the month of June. Rooms are good with all basic amenities. View from hotel is also charming. The hoyel is located in the middle of chopta and Ukhimath, in the middle of forest. So not recommended if you do not have car with you. You have to depened on the hoyel restaurant as there are not much options near by..  And this hotel does not have electricity as it is located in the middle of forest. But the hotel has its own generator which is operational from 19:00 to 22:00.. The atmosphere at night is a memorable experience.  As expected mobile network is weak.

Located at Pothibasa, almost midway between Ukhimath a Chopta, on the Ukhimath Gopeshwar Road.

The hotel also suitably located for visiting Deoria Tal, Sari Village the starting point for the Deoria Tal treck also about half an hour’s drive.

We were three couples travelling, one of us had a one year old baby, hence, we were a little skeptical about this trip. However, for people planning to visit Chopta, I would very strongly recommend this hotel. Its location is excellent; the hotel stands right at the edge of a beautiful valley. The Deoria Taal trek point is 6 kms away while the Tunganath-Chandrashila trek point is 15 kms away from the hotel. Rooms have great view of the mountain ranges, you can even see the Chandrashila peak from them! They are spacious, clean, and very very comfortable. Washrooms are clean and well maintained.
