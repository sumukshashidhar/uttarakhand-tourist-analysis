rudraprayag,These are well maintained cottages with clean and well kept beds and blankets. Geyser is available in the bathroom for hot water but it totally depends on whether there is electricity at that point of time. It is located at hardly half a kilometer from the main temple hence temple is easily accessible. They donâ€™t have room service hence for food one has to visit the restaurant which is right opposite to the cottages. All in all ..comfortable stay.,Sunita P,/Profile/SKJP_1982,"Mumbai, India",40
