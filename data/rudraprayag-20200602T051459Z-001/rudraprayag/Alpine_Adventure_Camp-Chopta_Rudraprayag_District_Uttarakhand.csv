rudraprayag,The location is good. The people are hospitable and they understand even if you don't say it. The quality of food is better than regular camps. The size of camps makes you feel as if you are in a luxurious hotel room. Bathroom has western style toilet which is well maintained. The only thing which I found a drawback is relative distance from Chopta. You must have a vehicle if you enter this area as camps generally don't provide you pick and drop. You can consider this place without hesitation. ,Vivek_Singh,/Profile/Vivek_Singh,"New Delhi, India",40
rudraprayag,Best ever camping experience ever. 5/5 rate for cleaning. Adequate services were there. Only thing that isn't there is network since it is an eco sensitive zone. The staff is super supportive. They even provide you with solar lamps for night as that area is all solar powered. View is awesome especially in bright sunshine. Overall it's a must stay when in chopta.,rituudmri,/Profile/rituudmri,"Dehradun, India",50
rudraprayag,To start with pro 1)beautiful place great view 2) good food 3)hygienic 4)staff were helpful   Cons 1)you will not find any public convenience or any sought of taxi  2)no mobile connectivity  3)lights are out by 7.30 -8 4)the place wants to mint money from the customers.. this is what had happened with us .. we had initially booked the place for 3 nights but since there was nothing much to do we planned to leave the place 3rd day morning .. while we were leaving and clearing our dues the resort manager asked us to pay money for 3rd nite too..  he was very rude. Finally we dint pay him..this incident kinda ruined our overall experience.. it seemed ppl in Chopta only want to mint money.. although I understand that's how they earn their bread and butter.. ,57abhar,/Profile/57abhar,"New Delhi, India",30
rudraprayag,"If you are planning for Chopta, think about Alpine Adventure Camp. Swiss Cottage Deluxe Tents, with good food and ambience. Once you wake up, you will get different types of view season wise. In the Summer, snow capped peaks you can see, in rainy season lush green and winter snow covered white wash. Strongly recommend Alpine Adventure Camp for a beautiful experience. Please note no electricity no mobile network there.",Rahul1974,/Profile/Rahul1974,"New Delhi, India",50
rudraprayag,"Alpine camp is surrounded by a good view of Himalaya and greenery allover. The camp is so beautiful, warm, clean and safe as well. The staff is very helpful and supportive, they will tell u each and every thing about this place, history, culture, best view points and everything. I really loved my two day stay there. We had amazing food- rajma chawal, paneer, chapati ghee, salad, papad, daal and tea coffes with cookies. They make food on desi-chulha. they have veg and non-veg facility both. They have a big and comfy dinning hall, they dont allow to eat inside the tent. The view is so catchy in morning, dont forget to get up early for sunrise, its so pleasing. go on treaking and njoy bonfire as well. The road to reach alpine is so easy and direct. we didnt thought of we ll njoy",Anuradha S,/Profile/AnuradhaS249,,50
rudraprayag,"It is a lovely campsite with clean tents and attached bathrooms. Each tent has 3 beds. The view from the campsite is amazing. You see the mightly white himalayas, which leave you spellbound. Food is average, simple, home cooked. Evening snacks should be improved upon as currently it is only aaloo gobhi pakoras. They have another campsite around half a km away. But this one doesn't have the spectacular himalayan view of this one. One can only see a few trees from this campsite, so definitely chose the main one.",Shaili P,/Profile/Ms_Shaili,"New Delhi, India",40
rudraprayag,We a group of 6 adults visited Chopta and stayed at Alpine Adventure Camps for three nights. Our experience in the camp was excellent. The camp is situated 6 km before Chopta. The view from the camp is awesome as all the day on a clear day one gets to see the lofty snow clad peaks. It is AN EXCELLENT PLACE FOR BIRDERS. The camp is some 15 feet below the road level but then that is normal and expected in a hilly area. All the camps are on a level ground and children would find ample space to play and run around. The staff is extremely cordial and delivered anything we required in our tents always with a smiling face. The owner Shri Manoj Singh Negi is a straightforward yet differential person. Each tent is big enough to accommodate three persons and has attached toilet. The bed,Sandeep M,/Profile/sandeep_mukherjee611,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",50
rudraprayag,Hi i visited to alpine adventure camp again in this summer. My experience with this camp was awesome. All staff very friendly. Sufficient Facilities provided to us. Go n enjoy the AAC n nature together. ,Pradeep S,/Profile/pradeeps541,,50
rudraprayag,"The locations is decent for this camp however the facilities are anything but average. The entrance to the camp is at least 10 -15 feet down with a slope made with stones , so if you have a elderly with you, pls think twice. The camp folks had to get a chair and 4 people held it to take the elderly to the camp. The food is decent and the staff is warm.  If you can avoid taking the elderly, the camp should serve fine since you cant find much in the region.",Dinesh Rathod,/Profile/DineshRathod,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
rudraprayag,"Alpine Adventure camp is located about 8 kms from chopta . The tents are located on nice meadow.  The green mountain slopes, stream behind the camp with gurgling water, chirping of birds - all give a soothing comfort. The tents are quite spacious and well provided for. Beds are clean and comfortable. Good place to take a break ",Murlidhar S,/Profile/murali_1951,"Bengaluru, India",40
rudraprayag,"The camp offers makeshift tents with permanent toilets attached to them. The  tents are fairly clean and the toilets are well maintained. One cannot expect a five star accommodation in a place like this and if one has an inclination towards living amidst nature with bare minimum necessities, this is the place to go. The staff was courteous and served good food. The view the camp offers is the USP of this place. We'd like to go back again!",SDhar_10,/Profile/SDhar_10,"Bengaluru, India",40
rudraprayag,We were family of six including two senior citizens and stayed there for two nights.  The camp has excellent scenic beauty.  One can watch beautiful birds in the morning. The staff of the camp was courteous and provided us all the amenities needed.  Food was homely and prepared the way we wanted.  But the signage for directions on the road needs improvement.  The approach path from the road too can be made more comfortable.  ,Parveen Kumar,/Profile/102parveenk,"Noida, India",40
rudraprayag,We are disappointed with Alpine adventure camp. We planned a trip with our family including 1 child.  Alpine Camp is situated 7km before chopta it's not in chopta. So if you don't have your vehicle it will be difficult to arrange vehicle.  There is no mobile network at the camp in case of emergency you cannot contact anybody.  As we had told before booking welcome local drink will be served with evening snacks nothing was available on a n number of request they agreed to make egg for us.  As we are from Mumbai we are not fond of cold weather so we asked them to arrange a bonfire again thy denied. We were six ppl.  The behaviour of the staff are very nice.  My advice if you are planning to visit Alpine please visit with friends or a group not with family.  Worst part no,Iven  W,/Profile/928ivenw,Navi Mumbai,10
rudraprayag,"We stayed here for 2 Nights and we had booked all the 8 Tents and we were family of 21 Members with kids and ladies . Extremely beautiful place to stay and view is amazing.  Tents were with attached Toilet and bath. If you are looking for a luxury than this place is not for you. This place has very basic facilities and simple food, looking at the location, facilities provided were sufficient.   Hot water for bath is available on request.    Swiss Tents are bigger than other tents, all the staff including Camp Owner Manoj were very helpful and supportive.   We had made Alpine as our base camp and first day Mr. Manoj organised mountain climbing and jungle walk which was amazing experience for the whole group. we had never done such thing in the past. Second day we did trekking to",MAHAVIR,/Profile/MAHAVIR78,"Ahmedabad, India",40
rudraprayag,So this place proved out to be best for an all girls trip. Mr Negi and his staff was really helpful and caring. Cleanliness was everywhere. Be its beds or washrooms.

rudraprayag,"If you want to escape the drudgery, routine and filth of Indian city life, give this a go! Chopta in Uttarakhand is a lovely mountainous area, with lots of trekking options. The camp has fantastic views of the snow capped Himalayas, Trishul and Chaukamba amongst them. Our main guide and organiser of the Alpine Camp (who managed everything!), Sumant Bajwal proved to be fantastic! He looked after us well in the camp and organised our 4 day trek in the surrounding areas (Deoria Tal to Tungnath), cooks, tents, the works. The main Alpine Camp itself is an experience, canvas tents with an attached bathroom, hot water available in buckets, flush toilets , sink. The beds were quite comfortable and clean.

Site of the camp is surrounded by dense forest and meadows in quite peace and free from all type of pollution.  The camp is very modern and well furnished also well maintained.  Cleanliness of the camp is well appreciable.  Food served was very tasty, hot and appears very fresh served by warm and cheerful people.  Above all, the ‘Team Alpine’ behaved like nearest family guest which gave us home like atmosphere.  Special thanks to Mr Manoj Negi (owner) for the care taken during the stay in the camp.

rudraprayag,"We were 2 families 4 adults and 4 children in Oct. We stayed 2 nights. Pros:- This place has good mountain views. You can see Mt. Kedar but cannot see Chaukhamba however. There is a small valley nearby. The staff (Harish, Sumant) was handful but helpful. They were ready to boil water and supply it in tents anytime. No extra cost for that. On checkout day, the staff was helpful enough to get the hot water and breakfast ready early in the morning for us. We had requested them the previous night. By 8:00am we left for Noida. The tents are spacious. We had 3 beds for a family of 4.  Cons:  The tent are ill maintained. Some of the new tents do not have a washbasin although they have toilets with running cold water from the mountain waterfalls. We changed to old tent the next day.",jassies,/Profile/jassies,"Noida, India",20

The camp is located in the laps of mother nature. The food was absolutely amazing.  Sumant, who was our trekking guide and Alpine staff member, is a very nice chap.
