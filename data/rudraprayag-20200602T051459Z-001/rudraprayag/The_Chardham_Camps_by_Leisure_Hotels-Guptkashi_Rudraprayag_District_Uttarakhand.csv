rudraprayag,"Sharing my experience at Chardham camp leisure hotels  Barkot The camp at Barkot is good, what makes it special is the the camp manager and staff. very responsible camp manager and staff who takes care of everything you need....right from hot water to breakfast / tea / dinner . Highly recommend stay at Barkot camp.Delicious food.  Harsil The camp at Harsil is average as compared to Barkot, however the location of the camp is very good, right next to Bhagirathi river. Camp needs to be upgraded. Average staff and average food. they take care of you well, provide you with hot water bags after your tiring day. Little camp upgrade and more attentive staff needed. Camp manager makes good attempt to meet your requirements.  Guptkashi The camp at Guptkashi is to be avoided at all cost.",IndTr,/Profile/IndTr,,10
rudraprayag,"I really enjoyed my 3 nights at Chardham. The tents were spacious and clean. The beds were comfortable, the food delicious and the staff friendly and helpful. The view is amazing. The only improvements they could make would be with the hot water which came out of the tap, once they got it sorted, looking a bit rusty. Also there was no laundry service so I had to hand wash some stuff. Other than that, I am really happy to recommend staying here as a great base to visit some of the old and powerful temples in this region",Mike B,/Profile/F5004ITmikeb,"Wellington, New Zealand",40

rudraprayag,"Stayed for 2 days on our way to Kedarnath.. Nice tents.. Homely food.. Courteous staff.. Mr.Chandan, Camp Manager was very professional.. Helped us a lot in planning for our stay in Kedarnath..There is a helipad (not owned by Chardham camps.) .. can avail for travel to Kedarnath",Raghavendar R,/Profile/RaghavendarR4,,40
rudraprayag,"This camp is a little away from Guptakashi town. It is also a Leisure Hotels property, and the third such one I stayed in during my Chota Char Dham trip in June 2017. The camp has a beautiful view of the Himalayas. Ensconced in the mountains, peace and quite serenade you at this camp. The tented accommodation was similar to Barkot and Harsil. This camp serves as a base for the Kedarnath Dham. The most outstanding feature about this camp (besides its views) is it's exceptional staff. They are really hard working and work overtime to make guests' stay comfortable. Most people leave for the yatra as early as 3.30-4am. The staff is up and about and ready to serve the guests. The food served at the camp is wholesome and appetizing. They comply with guest requests on packed",ANJUGOELA,/Profile/ANJUGOELA,MUMBAI,40

rudraprayag,"We stayed here two nights during last week of May 2016 for Kedarnath tour. Manager, Mr. Chandan and his staff welcomed us with genuine smile and were good throughout.   We reached in the evening and were told that medical test certificate at designated centres of Uttarakhnad government by their own doctors is a must to visit Kedarnath. We rushed immediately to the centre about 5kms away, waited till 7pm and returned back unsuccessful because of the rush. We were not aware which helipad and what time we were supposed to report. Our chardham tour organizer, Makemytrip customer care was unresponsive over phone, as usual. Fortunately, matter was sorted out at night. Next day early morning, we visited the centre again for the medical test, which was a total farce; only a harassment",Santu18,/Profile/Santu18,"Mumbai, India",40
rudraprayag,"This place is located in the midst of the hills and has great views on all sides, not to forget mentioning the superb view of the Kedar top. The amenities were very nice and the staff was very very supportive.  Mr.Chandan and his team are doing a great job to manage all the customer demands with a smile and a sincere attitude",yeda420,/Profile/yeda420,"Mumbai, India",50
rudraprayag,"Tent were run down with dirty carpets. Bathrooms had patches of standing water with soggy smell inside. Zip to close the doors were not working. But the camp is away from the main Guptkashi and being at higher elevation has a good view of the valley. Camp manager was very helpful working hard to fix issues. Food at least on one of the days was better than all the camps in chardham yatra. There is a helipad right next to the camp and will be noisy when flights are operational.   Kedarnath valley seem to get lot more visitors (than yamunotri, gangotri) and so noticed much better/comfortable stay options along the way with better facilities. Camps on this route are a waste of time and money for what they offer.",Srinidhi H,/Profile/SrinidhiH3,,30
rudraprayag,"This property gives excellent view of the mountains on sides of the property and the support given by the staff is very good. Even nearby there is a helipad of Devbhoomi, travellers can book tickets for Kedarnath from here and in case not available go to other helipads. We had started for our booked helipad at Sitapur and were stuck in traffic jam from morning 4.30am to 7.30am and then reached our helipad. The tents near the exit provide excellent view of mountains and near to helipad will have noise distrubance due to helicopter flying.",jvd4801,/Profile/jvd4801,"Mumbai, India",40
rudraprayag,This property provides you basic accomodation on your way to kedarnath. The tents are functional though it would have been nice to have cleaner sheets. Hot water was not available. you could hear guests hollering across to the staff....However the warmth of the service staff and good food makes your stay bearable,Viewfinder1203,/Profile/Viewfinder1203,"Mumbai, India",30
rudraprayag,"We stayed at this property at the end of May 2016... It was the Base for our Kedarnathji Darshan... This is a fairly new property as compared to the Joshimath one and so the camps are bigger and better... The scenic  views of the snowcapped mountains are awesome and simply take your breath away!!! We stayed here for two nights and the staff was very friendly and helpful !!! Right from providing Hot water bottles to Hot Bhajias, they were eager to help and provide... A special Thanks to Mr Chandan, the camp manager for all the help and hospitality!!!  Downside : The major downside is that the camp arranges for a chopper ride from a far     off helipad... Ours was at Sitapur, some 35 kms from the campsite and had to leave the camp by 4.30 am... got stuck in a major traffic jam...",Mridul G,/Profile/mgoyal,,30
rudraprayag,"We stayed here as our main destination was Kedarnath and we had read that this camp its own helipad on premises and operates a helicopter service to and from Kedarnath. Unfortunately they due to some license issue this service was not available and we had to travel about 40 minutes to get to another helipad. This obviously was not in their control.   This camp is located amidst fields and with a view of snow capped mountains from every tent. The views are simply breathtaking. The tents are basic and clean. Hot water is available in buckets provided by the staff at your door. The food is vegetarian (as in all of Guptkashi),home style and with ample variety. The staff are very efficient and ever willing to meet all your needs with a smile. On certain occasions we needed quick",Trupti W,/Profile/222truptiw,"Colva, India",30

rudraprayag,"Our journey from Auli to Guptkashi was some tiresome via chopta and after we reached Guptkashi we took a left side uphill road at Nala and from there it is 4km to reach the campsite. When we reached it was dark and nobody could be seen on road and we're unsure whether we're going in a right direction. But the hoteliers were in constant touch to help us with the direction.   As it is offseason for Kedarnath, we found, we're the only tenants for the first night. We're welcomed with fruit drinks and were given the housetents which were clean and spacious. The attached toilet was bigger and clean. There was a girgit (Metaphoric lizard) inside toilet and the service boy made it away. Also we're given a hit spray to kill some giant mosquitoes and small insects inside tents. But this",Traveller_Ambar,/Profile/Traveller_Ambar,"Kolkata, India",50
rudraprayag,"From haridwar me and my parents reached Guptakashi,  the moment we reached I felt so glad.  We could see the mountains filled with snow and our camp with an awesome view of those same mountains..  it was jst breathtaking.  The best part is the helicopter we booked left from there itself to go kedarnath.  So during the day we could see the take off and landings on helicopter and the camp is soo nicely maintained with all different kinds of flowers.. u can jst sit out have a cup of tea and enjoy the moment. Its priceless.   The staff there are v eryy warm and helpful. And the food is also very gd there..  M glad I took a decision to stay there and next day morning went to kedarnath jee darshan and back to the camp. Anyone going to kedarnath jee. I would definitely suggest to stay",sang86,/Profile/sang86,,50

It was as if we were living in dream.The swiss tents once again were beautiful, spic and span ,The toilets (european) were properly sanitised and very clean.Hot water was available.The food was execellent,and we were really pampered there .The staff very good and efficient.

rudraprayag,"Whenever I go to Kedarnath, Kalimath, Ukhimath or Ruch Mahadev, I halt at Char Dham Guptakashi for the night. I must say that they have maintained their quality for the last 10 years. The hotel staff are very nice and pleasant. They supply hot water in buckets, whenever you need and as many buckets we need. Since this camp is in the hills, we need to be careful of insects and inform the hotel staff, who promptly takes care. The good part is that they don't kill the insects, but removes from the camp.  This is the only hotel, which is of star status in the vicinity. They have a buffet breakfast, which is quite elaborate, looking at the hilly region. The same goes with dinner as well.",Ash_rishikesh,/Profile/Ash_rishikesh,"Bengaluru, India",50
rudraprayag,"I stayed there last week for two nights. after whole day journey when I reached this place suddenly got energized seeing the beautiful environment surrounded by mountains. spacious clean tents with attached bathroom,clean bed ,really helpful staff , great food and breathtaking panoramic view of mountains. very calm and peacefull place . not far from gaurikund and very near to the helipads of various helicopter service provider. hospitality is really good.I would love to spend some more days just sitting in front of tent looking at the mountains where lots of drama unfolding in front of your eyes every hour like changing of colors of the ice , light and shade,sunny day to sudden thunder strom,dark cloudy sky to clear blue sky over the icy mountains. love this place.",sohelimages,/Profile/sohelimages,gurgaon,50
rudraprayag,"On our way to kedarnath we planned a stay at this place in june'2012, and it was really a great experience. I was self driving my car and after reaching this place all my fatigue vanished in seconds.  The tents are comfortable enough with clean toilets attached to it. Considering its a tent n not a room of a hotel, the toilets n tents was clean enough. The bed was also comfortable with clean linen. we asked for an extra bed which was promptly provided and had enough space for it. The best part is, the tents had electricity points for lights and mobile/laptop chargers.  The place is situated on a mountain top and the view from your tents is very beautiful n refreshing.   The food was also good. Not a lavish spread, considering its a tented accommodation, but it was well prepared.",vaibhav_jain160976,/Profile/vaibhav_jain160976,"New Delhi, India",40

rudraprayag,apart from our overall experience with d chardham group tjiswas by far d worst experience we had ever had. the tents were all covered in moss and dirt and had spiders inside. no cleanliness and maintainence. also d staff is very unhelping and rude. apart from our group every other guest had a fight with d staff people for thier uncooperative behaviour. the food was good as was at other camps . no massage options dere too. but d whole climatewas very favourable . d location was good on a hill top.a very plesant view on d himalayan ranges. nice plantation.,ankitjhawar,/Profile/ankitjhawar,indore,30

rudraprayag,Its a well designed hotel in the foot hills of Kedarnath. Excellent location as it gives you the complete view of mountains and the villages near by. we opted for tents.

rudraprayag,"We were quite skeptical when we arrived here.  The place was quite isolated and away from the hustle-bustle of the town.    The tents were rather small in size and had become dirty with the passage of time.  There were two single beds in the tent which was about 12 feet x 12 feet in dimensions.  Toilet was attached and was clean.  Though there was provision for piped hot water, we had to make do with bucket bath!  The best part about this camp was the quality of its employees.  They were extremely polite and prompt.  I was fasting because of an auspicious month of Hindu Calendar and they allowed my wife and me inside their kitchen (which was quite clean) and cooked special meal as per our instructions.

Location is a great and one gets amazing view on a clear day. Site is too far from town and very quiet. Staff wonderful and give very good advise on do's and don't.

On our way to Kedarnath, we found this quaint, warm and comfortable stop over just the place to take a day off before our pilgrimage to 2 of the Dhams.

Good food with a wonderful choice for breakfast.",anita1104,/Profile/anita1104,"Mumbai, India",50
rudraprayag,The camp is run by a bunch of dope smoking staff who were rude and abusive. It is a shame that such things happen in such a place which is so close to kedarnath and for which people come with a greater sense of religous sentiments.The owner of the camp was very rude and a fake person who talked about things that he does not beleive and do himself and payed no attention to the complaints made to him,mountaingypsy,/Profile/mountaingypsy,New Delhi,10
rudraprayag,"We stayed 2 nights at this camp. The camp is located in the outskirts of Guptakashi and on the way to Kedarnath. Firstly, the location was fantastic, overlooking several snow capped peaks and in the midst of a beautiful flower filled garden.   The tents were very comfortable and warm despite the weather being cold and rainy. I wouldn't call them luxury tents, but they were very clean and large enough to accomodate two adults and two kids.   The food was very tasty, healthy and homely. On the morning that we started our trek to Kedarnath, the staff packed a very wholesome b'fast at 4:00 am in the morning. Dinners on both days was very good.   I must add, the service is top class. Each member of the staff was very helpful and eager to assist. They went out of their way to keep us",MadhaviC,/Profile/MadhaviC,"Bengaluru, India",40
