rudraprayag,We stayed at this hotel as a group of 12 Yatris overnight as part of our visit to Kedarnath. We had stayed at this hotel in 2012 as well. The hotel is comfortably located from a lot of helipads which ferry yatris to Kedarnath and back. The owner Mr. Negi and his son were hospitable and attended to our requirements sincerely.  Rooms were neat Bathrooms were also clean Linen was clean Food was good No wi-fi and we have to manage with 2G data speed on mobiles  I am someone who believes that the drivers also need a comfortable stay as their body needs more rest than the passengers. The rooms were full. The hotel however managed a make-shift arrangement for the night. It would help if they are able to provide a couple of exclusive rooms to drivers  Comfortable stay and would like to,Wholesome_life,/Profile/Wholesome_life,"Chennai, India",40
rudraprayag,This is a hotel for short stay. Location is excellent. The staff is friendly but not trained. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Room service is not there. Restaurant is not there. One has to go out and hunt for food.,anands983,/Profile/anands983,"NEW DELHI, India",30
rudraprayag,We stayed here while our visit to Kedarnath. I wasnt expecting much but this Hotel was exactly what we needed. The time when we visited this place the Tourism market was down due to flood last year so we got a good deal. I think it was 1000 Rs/night. very specious and clean rooms/beds etc. We were very happy with the quality of food. Its in a small village and people are of Welcoming nature. They offered milk to my little son. And if you are staying there do not forget to meet the Yoga teacher next to this Hotel.,Firangi,/Profile/Firangi,"Houston, Texas",40
rudraprayag,"We stayed here for just one night. Rooms are OK but absolutely no customer service. When we got up at 5 AM, there was no water in any of our 3 rooms & no one to complaint to or get help! We did not expect much but food could have been certainly better!",KRPS,/Profile/KRPS,"Chennai District, India",20
rudraprayag,"Stayed at this place overnight during our trip to Kedarnath. Here's my review.  Location : Literally no man's land!! This place is located 6 kms beyond Guptkashi, and 7 kms before Phata Helipad. There is nothing in the vicinity of the place. If you want to buy something (example: medicine), you got to travel back to Guptkashi. The entry to the hotel is through a steep slope, which senior citizens will find a little difficult to climb. There are rooms on ground and first floor with no lift facility.   Rooms : Can't expect much at such remote places. Rooms were basic with attached bathrooms and hot water available during the morning. However, the bed linens were dirty and seem to have been washed months ago.   Food / Restaurant : Being in no man's land, every resident will be",SunMoh,/Profile/SunMoh,"Bentonville, Arkansas",20
rudraprayag,It is located around 4-5km from Guptkashi. It is clam and silent place. Viewing Chokhamba Peak from the roof of hotel at just before evening is very amazing. Foods are good enough but cost is more in the hotel . Overall we are enjoy here and on the way to kedarnath,samanta_dilip_123,/Profile/samanta_dilip_123,"Kolkata, India",40
rudraprayag,"We stayed in this hotel on our way to Kedharanath. It was a nice hotel with spacious rooms and clean bathrooms. The beds were comfortable with well washed, wrinklle-free linen. When we asked for extra linen they immediately provided without additional charge.  The Meals were very good and delicious. On request, they promptly provided Coffee, Tea and milk.The staff paid attention to every aspect to make the stay comfortable.  Moreover, The staff were very friendly and helpful on arrival and throughout our stay. When we asked about the availability of Helicopter services they provided all the necessary information and called the helicopter operators and spoke on behalf of us and made the seat bookings. Further, arranged a transport for us to proceed to Helipad.    I will recommend",saratha s,/Profile/681sarathas,"Western Australia, Australia",50
rudraprayag,"On my way to Kedarnath I have stayed in this hotel, response of owner Mr. Negi was quite warm and cordial. During my stay I have enjoyed the beauty of valley from our rooms. Although it was first week of May and capital of India was roasting , here with the dusk we were forced to wear pullover and warm clothing on 10th May. Although menu is limited but it was quite holy and healthy. ",kr_yogesh_singh,/Profile/kr_yogesh_singh,"New Delhi, India",40
