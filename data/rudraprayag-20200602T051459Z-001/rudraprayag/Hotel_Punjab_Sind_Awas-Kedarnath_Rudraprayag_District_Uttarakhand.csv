rudraprayag,"Although its situated in such height and odd location, Rooms were clean and staff was friendly and helpful. Food was below average but manageable . Its close to the temple and thats the biggest advantage. Bathrooms were clean. No hot water or heater in the room. So you have to depend on them for providing a bucket of hot water , which they give 24x7. Adequate blankets and quilts were provided for the cold weather. No towels, toiletries etc are provided. Its a basic room with an attached bathroom.",Ankit Daga,/Profile/DAGANKIT,"Raipur, India",50
rudraprayag,"We - 12 friends- stayed at this hotel on October 1, 2019. The location is the biggest advantage. Just 200 feet from the Kedarnathji temple.  Rooms are big enough. Ground floor rooms dont get hoti water in the rooms. They serve hot water in buckets starting 330 AM. The first floor rooms have geaser in the rooms.  Toilets are good.   Food is average. Only negative is some staff are not polite. Also, you dont get early morning tea.  Overall hygiene is good. Location suppresses all negatives!!",Darshan29,/Profile/Darshan29,"Bengaluru, India",40

rudraprayag,"Punjab Sindh Awas, Kedarnath is the most comfortable and worth staying hotel. The rooms have homely essence. And the rooms have four bedded and extra bed facility. Contect us  9412915221,9897370754,9412914942..",awasthisa,/Profile/awasthisa,,50
rudraprayag,"Yes my experience was good in this hotel.Its only 100 meter away from the temple. Room, toilets are clean and staffs are very good and helpful. And this hotel is having a canteen  , you cant get restaurant like food but you will get simple good food.

rudraprayag,"I was in Kedarnath few days back. I wanted to stay near the temple as was possible and meditate. I got into this Punjab Sind Awas. All rooms were empty. The manager demanded Rs. 800. I accepted.  The room was so dirty, as if it was not cleaned in a decade. The carpets and the sheets were smelling. I am still suffering with ailments after couple of weeks. The manager said that they prepare excellent food fresh. I believed him. And ordered for food at a specific time. I refreshed myself under extremely unhygienic conditions and went ahead to visit the temple. On return, the Punjab Sind Awas  did not bother to supply the dinner they promised. After waiting for an hour, I dressed up to go out to eat in nearby dhaba.  Then this cook comes in with few rotis and very  little subji. And",anandcct1,/Profile/anandcct1,"Bengaluru, India",10
rudraprayag,"Good clean room, hot water and some really thick quilts are what you need in a  cold place and this lodge provides that. Owner Rishi is very friendly, prompt and responsive over the phone, making the booking process easy.  This is one of the lodgings that has survived the 2013 floods with minimal/a little damage. It is hardly 50m from the temple.  Food is prepared and served upon request. Other options for food is walking a good kilometer to the gmvn restaurant near the helipad.  Recommended  ",Kembhootha,/Profile/Kembhootha,Bangalore,40
rudraprayag,"Property is awesome, service is prompt, in-spite of geographical challenges staff is supportive & extends all support. Temperature during nights is below 0 degree hence hotel extends sufficient quilts, blankets to keep you warm & comfortable. Food provided by the hotel is good & you feel like having home food.",Saurabh,/Profile/saurabhp1,"New Delhi, India",50
