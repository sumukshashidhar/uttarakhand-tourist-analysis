rudraprayag,For searching this place through Google you should type Tungnath not chopta as there is one other Chopta near Rudraprayag & Google is picking that one. It is 28 km from Ukhimath on Badrinath-Kedarnath road. From Ukhimath to Chopta is very good road & natural beauty is worth enjoying. This camp is having best location in this area. Magpie camps are also in same area. it is always economical to call directly to camp manager in place of booking through Web sites. Camp manager is very helpful person & will provide all possible help there. Swiss tents are very clean & bed sheets etc are also up to the mark. During night under stars it would be all together heavenly feeling . I Will recommend Dehlites to come here atleast once in a year for charging their lungs with pure oxygen.,pktyagibhel,/Profile/pktyagibhel,"Haridwar, India",50

rudraprayag,"It was just amazing! Rameshji has done an excellent job with both the place and the food. His hospitality had us spellbound. The trek proved mindblowing, and the overall environment of the place is nothing short of magical. He made us small campfires under the starry skies in the evening. We had a wonderful time! So wonderful, in fact, that we want to go back very soon with our extended families since it seems to also be an ideal place to take older relatives and even small children. It's safe, homely and tremendously comforting to have a little place like this in the mountains!",gargi_bhattacharya,/Profile/gargi_bhattacharya,,50
