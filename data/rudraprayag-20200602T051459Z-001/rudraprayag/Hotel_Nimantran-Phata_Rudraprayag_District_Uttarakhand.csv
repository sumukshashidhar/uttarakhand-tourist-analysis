rudraprayag,Hotel is a good budget hotel. Food is awsome. Owner Mr. Devender is very cooperative and professional. Rooms are clean. Staff was very supportive and location is excellent if you are flying to Kedarnath via Pawan Hans or UTAir Heli services. We strongly recommend stay in Hotel Nimantran in Phata Kedarnath.,richa j,/Profile/194richaj,"New Delhi, India",50
