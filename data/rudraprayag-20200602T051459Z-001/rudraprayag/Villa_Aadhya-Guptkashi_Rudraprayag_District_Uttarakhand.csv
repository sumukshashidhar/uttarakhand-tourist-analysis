rudraprayag,"we stayed at this facility after having the darshan of Kedarnathji. Our aviation company accommodated us here after the drive from Sersi helipad that took more than one hour. the views are absolutely wonderful from the villa, friendly staff. The food is very ordinary, could have been better.  We yatrikas are not looking at the spread, but expect food palatable. Wash room had a odor, got hardly half a buck of hotwater.",Bhagini,/Profile/Bhagini,"Chennai, India",30

rudraprayag,"The moment you enter this property, you would be really mesmerized by the views. I hardly stayed inside the room and spent almost the day out on the chairs. The hotel is really maintained well. The rooms are cosy and have all basic amenities that you would want. I don't know if this is common across all hotels in Guptkashi but it was missing Electric Kettle. Anyways i didn't feel like missing it because tea, milk, coffee is just a call away and you can enjoy this out.  The only thing that did not go well is their restaurant. They don't have sufficient sitting capacity and have very limited menu. If you plan to order anything, check out the prices first. Overall nice experience and worth staying once. You would not regret.",Mohit Bansal,/Profile/MohitB857,"Greater Noida, India",40
rudraprayag,We had booked 2 rooms and stayed here for 2 nights. This was a stopover for darshan at Shri Kedanathji. The rooms were reasonably clean and food was simple but good. The staff were very helpful. The rooms had no telephone /intercom which was inconvenient. One of the rooms did not have a refrigerator. They did not have good staying and food facilities for driver. Had we known we would have paid extra for driver but we got to know only after we checked out. The location was very convenient from Phata helipad.,MumbaiKss,/Profile/MumbaiKss,"Mumbai, India",30

Staff is very courteous and helpful. The person at the reception helped and guided us for kedarnath darshan in the peak season. Food served in the dinner buffet was very tasty and they actually served us tea at 3 am in the morning as we had to leave for the trek. This gesture is highly appreciated.
