rudraprayag,"Stayed for the first time in this hotel after my return from Darshan of Lord Tungnath near Chopta. The vibes of this hotel were totally different from others in the same locality so I decided to check this out first. I may mention here that staff in another hotel near by Hotel Pushpdeep most rudely told us to get out since there were no rooms. At Mandakini hotel too situation was same but I requested the young and dynamic manager Mr. Lalit Negi for only a few hours stay and he agreed. The tariff was not steep for the excellent property so we checked in. Not only the room but even the corridors were sparkling clean, also the balconies. The toilet was excellent being spacious and very clean. Hot water was available round the clock. Food was pure veg and excellent in quality in",Anurag Kumar,/Profile/anuragkumarlko,"Lucknow, India",50

rudraprayag,"Stayed for one night. It is one of the best in Rudraprayag. A little away from the main market (1.5km), but all facilities are available nearby. Many similar hotels nearby within 100 meters. Peaceful and tourist locality. Check in and out was smooth. Manager was very polite but too conservative in his smile. Restaurant (in the ground floor) had plenty of house flies all around. Food was ok. Rooms were the best. Interiors were excellent. AC, Geyser were working well. Bathroom was spacious and very clean. Bed linen and towels were very clean. No lift. Room service for dinner was denied even for the accompanying senior citizen.

rudraprayag,"A quintessential mountain side, highway hotel with bare minimum facilities and amenities. The hotel is situated right on the highway to Badrinath / Kedarnath so it's a good place for a night halt. The rooms are decent but the linen could've been cleaner. The TV didn't work when we were there. The food is fine and the staff is helpful. You can see and hear the Alaknanda river from the hotel balconies.",soummo1472,/Profile/soummo1472,"Jamshedpur, India",30
rudraprayag,"We were enroute to Govind Ghat after 3 flights and a 6 hour car journey. We stopped at this place for the night for some rest before another long day ahead of us. Needless to say we did not get any because of the endless noise. If the honking wasn't bad enough, there was blaring music playing, people talking loudly in the early hours of the morning which meant we got zero sleep. This could have been a one off but we did not risk it on the way back. Bedsheets did not seem clean so we asked for clean sheets which they happily provided. On the plus side, the staff were helpful and there was hot water (In the not very clean showers). ",Adventurer781023,/Profile/Adventurer781023,,20

rudraprayag,Hotel Mandakini run by GMVN is located at scenic place. It is on the bank of river Mandakini.  There is beautiful view of mountain. Rooms are well furnished. Food is good and staff was courteous. Our stay was during rainy season. Hence they provided 1 towel for 2 persons which was only problem. However on insistence they provided extra towel. We stayed in a room starting with 4 from where river view was restricted. I feel view was better from the rooms starting with 2 or 1.,guptaashok_0511,/Profile/guptaashok_0511,"Noida, India",50

rudraprayag,"I stayed with my parents in the hotel for 1 day. Room was average (Family Room) with very poor lighting. There was no view from the room. Food was very average and according to quality price was on higher side. Hotel doesn't have lift facility and they don't provide room service. My parents are senior-citizen, therefore on request they at least provided tea in the room. During booking through phone, they told me that breakfast is included in the stay but after reaching there they denied it. They don't clarify such things in email. Please take these details in written before booking the room.",SpaceDelhi,/Profile/SpaceDelhi,Delhi,20
rudraprayag,"Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in a family room. The hotel is really nice and very close to the prayag, on the Badrinath marg. The hotel provides excellent view of the river from the common balcony. The main attraction would be though the foods served, I would say it is the best in Rudraprayag. They do serve non-veg items as per customer request, though you wont get it on the menu card. The only problem is , the unavailibility of elevator and the stairs are really stiff. If you are ok to adjust on this, this is the best hotel in town.",sudip r,/Profile/601sudipr,,50

rudraprayag,Mandakini has beautiful location in Rudraprayag. We have visited last month to Kedar- on way from Delhi to Shonprayag & return we took two day stay in the hotel. The first day we received hospitality at highest point. On that basis while coming back we took the opportunity to stay there. That time  we did not receive the same ; rather it was worst. Our children were sick - we booked AC room but the owner asked us not to use AC as there is some electricity problems but other rooms were using AC at the same time. However the rate was not being considered for not using AC. We decided to vacate the room at 12 noon- as our children were sick we vacated at around 2 p.m-- we requested to consider the charges-- they did not--somehow we feel cheated at the moment.,Sanghamitra C,/Profile/SanghamitraC14,,30

But, it didn't really bother us too much, because we were just passing through. The people are very nice and pleasant.
