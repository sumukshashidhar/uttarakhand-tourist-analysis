rudraprayag,We stayed here for a night from Auli to Dehradun. It is right on the highway. Absolutely accessible. The restaurant serves good food with great service. The staff is super sweet. The view from the windows is beautiful.. valley and river. Good for a night halt,sonia4toi,/Profile/sonia4toi,"Mumbai, India",40
rudraprayag,"It was a stopover on our trip to Tunganath, the Highest Shiva temple in the world.  And this more of a hotel and less of a resort, was fantastic.  It’s bang on the road and will fall on the right side if you are going from Karnaprayag to Rudraprayag. And right of this hotel is the river Mandakini. So it’s stratled between highway and river and obviously there would be two categories of rooms, one facing the highway and other facing the river and obviously, river facing rooms are costly.   We choose a family room which has two double beds, enough for a family of 4/5 and surprisingly it’s has two bathrooms which was very welcoming.   The river view was excellent from the room and also the hills look fantastic.   List Price is 7500/- per night which is high but considering this is",riteshjoshi2020,/Profile/riteshjoshi2020,"Mumbai, India",40
rudraprayag,A satisfactory place to break your journey for the night. The location is excellent. Sangam of Alakhnanda and Mandkini rivers is not far. Private parking is available. It has a good sized restaurant. We visited in April (off season) when food choices were limited but quality was good.,Balisc,/Profile/Balisc,,30
