rudraprayag,"We stayed at this campsite for 3 days. It's on badrinath road at baniyakund about 5 km before chopta towards dogalbitta. There are 3 camps and 6 cottages located on a small bugiyal facing the beautiful Himalayas. Ashis Chandra the owner and santosh negi the cook were really awesome. Santosh bhai , our ustadji is really good in cooking varieties of North indian items and even momos and mutton dishes. They were at our service every moment. This camp is highly recommended.",Shibaji C,/Profile/shibajic2015,,50
rudraprayag,Our stay at Chandrika camps was a 2 day 2 night stay which we think is a short duration if you are visiting Chopta. Its a very long drive from Delhi but its a hidden gem with very less population and amazing Himalayan view. We stayed in the base camp for one night and camped 3 kms before Chandrashila the next day. It was one of the best views I have seen till date. Ashish and his team were very sweet and flexible. They were not fussy at all about our requirements of  different types of camps and rooms. They also gave us many options for our meals. The only small issue was the smell from the compost of animals near the base camp but it won't bother you if you are into farming or if you are a true nature lover.  Over all it was a great choice for stay and the place for an extended,Vanshika_HandB,/Profile/Vanshika_HandB,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40

rudraprayag,"This is one of the best locations if you are not staying in Tungnath everything is available here.This is like a small market just before the chopta main market. If you stay in any other place you are at the mercy of the camp staff to provide you with basic necessities here you don't .  The camp is much better than few of the other camps I stayed during my previous visit .They have nice double bed ,neat & clean rooms . The food was one of the best I had .The view from the room is excellent & Mr Ashish takes personal care of you we were stuck in rain while coming back to the camp from Tungnath.We called our driver but he was drunk & sleeping .Mr Ashish drove his vehicle til the pick up point without any extra charge.  He packed our breakfast on our way back to Delhi despite our",Puru2412,/Profile/Puru2412,"New Delhi, India",50
rudraprayag,"We were a group of 7 and we booked 3 rooms. The rooms were clean especially the bathrooms which is really important to me. The owner Ashish is really friendly and worked hard to make our stay great (provided us hot water for a bath). We even had a meal at the restaurant and it was very good value for money. The bonus part is really the surrounding views of the mountains and close access to a variety of places to see.. tungnath, chandrashila, devariya tal etc.",Vivek M,/Profile/vivekm3,,50
rudraprayag,"We were a group of 6 friends who visited Tunganath-Chandrashila and stayed at Chandrika Camps at Chopta. We reserved 3 deluxe tents (2 people in each). Rooms were decent- 3 double bed quilts to beat the cold, attached washroom. With a lush green field and beautiful Himalayan mountains, view outside the tents was amazing. Though electricity is a problem in the area, but solar powered generators could provide sufficient light in the evenings. Hot water for bathing was available on request. Package included all meals and the price for the stay was very low. The food was home-like and very delicious. However, the best part was the humble and caring nature of the owner, Mr. Ashish Maithili. He treated us like a family, asking us frequently about our needs and trying to fulfil them",Eshaan A,/Profile/EshaanA6,,50
