rudraprayag,Spacious rooms in the lovely location marked the stay at GMVN Chaukhamba TRH at Guptkashi. The cordial hospitality is an integral part of it.The beautiful sight of Chaukhamba Range is a plus point while the lovely walkway  through the mountains that take you to the Biswanath Temple right from the TRH is another .,Samik B,/Profile/SBKOLKATA2015,"Kolkata, India",40
rudraprayag,I booked this place becoz other co travellers opted for this. The room was quite neat and clean. they need to focus on many issues. Staff is not efficient to handle the rush during full occupancy days.  The need is to improve on toiletries. They provide 2 pouches of shampoo and a small soap bar. The towel provided was having lipstick marks of previous traveler.  Only 2 tea bags were given. No water bottle is provided. no lunch was ready at 12:30 when I came back. This property needs well trained staff,Sunil Dhawan,/Profile/Sunilpta,"Patiala, India",30

rudraprayag,GMVN property in guptkashi is the best property in that area. We booked 2 rooms which they call family huts but there are options for other deluxe or super deluxe rooms as well which you can book in advance at nominal prices. Rooms & Washrooms were quite clean. Food in the dining area was also quite good. Overall our stay of two nights was awesome. My Negi was a generous person who helped to make our stay comfortable. I would suggest everyone to make bookings in advance if your stay period is on weekends or on peak season specially June.,Chetan Sharma,/Profile/chetansharma123,"Chandigarh, India",50
rudraprayag,"Wonderful. Good management, good food. Rooms are awesome. We stayed in 3 Super deluxe rooms in the annexe. On our way to Badrinath, we stayed overnight here, while coming back from Kedarnath. Take a break at Chopta , a scenic ecstacy while going to Badrinath via Chamoli. GMVN Guptkashi is a must on your itinerary. View of Ukhimath by night, is heavenly.",Swapan Roy,/Profile/Swapanroy,"Silchar, India",50

The staff were so polite, helpful and friendly and professional. The manager Mr. Negi went out of his way to show me around as I was alone and made me feel very comfortable. Value for money. I would highly recommend it and would like to return soon.",Sangeeta K,/Profile/SangeetaK10,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",50

rudraprayag,I just completed an Yatra to Kedarnath and while goingvas well as on my way i stayed at this property for a night. I was here almost sixteen years back when it was barely a minimalistic joint with a hot bath and a neat bed set in a beautiful location overlooking the Chaukhamba peak the Mandakini way down below and Ukkhimath on the other side of the mountain. This time I was very pleasantly surprised to find the place in top condition with sleek renovation and very comfortable stay. The staff and the food they served was the best one can expect before and after an arduous trek to Kedarnath... Shall highly recommend this halt instead of Gaurikund enrout Kedarnath. Plenty of jeeps available on share that plies between Guptakashi and Gaurikund via Sonprayag ao one will seldom get,kalimpongboy,/Profile/kalimpongboy,"Kolkata, India",50

We stayed in GMVN guest house for two nights, since we availed helicopter services to go to Kedharnath.   It was in fact a splendid experience.  After having gone through hectic schedule to Gangotri and Yamunothri we were sufficiently tired. Our stay in the GMVN guest house is immemorable.   Food, hospitality. and hygiene conditions in the room are very good yet not so inexpensive which prompted me to write a review so that other travelers would benefit by the remarkable services rendered by GMVN.",Varadharajan M,/Profile/vmuruganandam,"Bhubaneswar, India",50

rudraprayag,"This is my second trip to Guptkashi in the last 3 years. First time I stayed in Himalayan Comfort and this time I voluntarily chose GMVN due to good ratings in TA which turned out to be a right choice.  Stayed in this hotel during first week of May.  1. The rooms would have been renovated an year back and we were allocated with 3 deluxe rooms in the ground floor.  2. Rooms were exceptionally clean and pleasant. The mattress was of good sleep quality.  3. The Staff was more than co-operative,helpful and exceptional.  4. Food was nice and there is a dining room in the ground floor and food is prepared and served hot and fresh.  5.Views from the hotel are nice and it is near to the main market.

rudraprayag,"To start let me clarify and say that we did not plan on staying at GMVN Guptkashi! We drove all day and reached the GMVN where, we learnt, that you can get your Yatra permits done. Upon arriving just after sundown, we discovered they have rooms available. We couldn't believe our stars! It was like getting a Visa on arrival in the US :). We originally planned on staying at Sonprayag or somewhere in Gaurikunda for our onward journey to Kedarnath the next day. But having got an accommodation at GMVN we cancelled those plans. The striking thing about the property is it location. You can clearly see the mighty himalayas and its peaks from the hotel parking lot. The property is very close to the hornet's nest.
