rudraprayag,"The hotel is right on the Guptkashi Sonprayag highway NH7 and the initial impression is it was rather dusty. In fact even though it is mentioned that parking is available it is basically parking on the highway only. And because of roadwork for broadening the highway it is more dusty. In fact our driver was really unhappy because of the car really got dusty parked on the highway. Also even though wifi is mentioned, there is no wifi in actuality. Even for a family of 3 the room is rather crunched and there was hardly any place to even put the mattress for the 3rd person. So there may be a doubt that inspite of all these negatives.  We stayed for 3 nights, and with the crunched space and dusty condition we were a bit upset.

rudraprayag,"The stay in Himalayan Comforts made our trip to Kedarnath, an experience worth remembering. The ambience and hospitality of the place on one side and the delicious food on the other is unparalleled. The beautifully done up huts face the Kedarnth peak and look down into the valley below. You can hear the river rushing by at the bottom and wind chimes hung  around the whole complex make it a very soothing and restful place. The furnishing and linen too is at par with any classy hotel.",priyankasriv,/Profile/priyankasriv,"New Delhi, India",50
