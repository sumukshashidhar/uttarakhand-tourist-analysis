rudraprayag,"What I experience at Mmakosha lodge was very bad we were charged R400 per head just to enter and makeup a client for Matric dance which is not specified on their notice board we didn't even spent 2hours there but we had to pay, when we entered the rooms yooh it was so bad then the light went off while we were busy and their service was very bad the reception was not good at all we needed clarification but no they didn't even bother to explain.I won't even recommend that place to anyone not at all",Phutijostine,/Profile/Phutijostine,,20
rudraprayag,"The toilet is not up to the mark but perhaps this is the only decent place compared to others where the rates aren't sky high. Also, it's close to the Tungnath trail.  The owner is a nice and helpful dude who has a good knowledge of places. Food was also quite good.",Rishi G,/Profile/rishiblock,,40
rudraprayag,I drove solo on bike to this place from Rishikesh in December first week. If you are someone who wants luxury even in mountains this is not the place for you. The place is simple yet caters to basic needs. It scores in hospitality and location. It's walkable distance from the starting point for Chandrashila trek. Food is great and team makes you feel welcome. For budget travellers and folks looking for short stay in Garwhal mountains this can be an experience to remember,SwairVihari,/Profile/SwairVihari,Chennai,40
rudraprayag,Rooms with attached toilet. Surrounded by snow on all sides. Located ideally at the starting point of Tungnath-Chandrishila trek on main road. The caretaker was helpful in providing trekking essentials and delicious food in cafe.,Madhup_Misra,/Profile/Madhup_Misra,"Noida, India",50
