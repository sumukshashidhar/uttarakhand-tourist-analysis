rudraprayag,"We visited Shivanandi during May 2019 and loved the place!. Overall hospitality of Shalabh and his team is just awesome. We loved the place, the alaknanda river and mountains. There is so much to do in this area. We stayed at Shivanandi for 6 nights and also traveled nearby places like Deoriatal, Chopta and Tungnath. Shivanandi Team offered us Rafting experience which was unmatched. We had 2 hours of rafting in Alaknanda river with best team who kept us safe. Food was good and homely. There is greenery all around and quite environment for medication/yoga.",Sandeep P,/Profile/778sandeepp,"Bangkok, Thailand",50

rudraprayag,"First of all, I would like to make it clear I didn't travel to this resort. I was excited though and wanted to book it for 3 nights for June (after reading all the positive reviews etc.) However, the kind of response on the email that I got was really shocking. Their website mentions cost of a room for 2 people as 3500 (including taxes). But when I wanted to book the same I was told that it will cost me 5500 + 18% taxes. When I showed them what their own site says, they said it will be updated ""today""?? Really?? I under it's a HIGH season and the location seems to be awesome but you aren't even transparent! You talk about constructing it with love and all.. what's the use of that when you aren't even transparent in the pricing or may be lots of greediness has creep in.  Because",VaiKunt,/Profile/VaiKunt,new delhi,10
rudraprayag,"Mountains, river, birds, greenary, very hospitable people, delicious food - you name it and you can experience in Shivanandi River Lodge.  Cleanliness and good food like upmarket hotel, but the rustic beauty of the home takes your breath away.  Rooms are tastefully done with very well kept bathrooms.  Waking up to chirping of birds and sighting lovely mountain birds is a treat.  Looking at Alaknanda river and the mountains from your room is very soothing.",Vijayalakshmi N,/Profile/VijayalakshmiN2,,50
rudraprayag,"Beautiful place.Nice homely food(a lil expensive though).50 mtrs away from Alaknanda river bank. they seem to have kyaks etc, but we cudn't do that as water was cold. Alaknanda pebbled beach looks awsome. there is a small lagoon kinda area as well. we stayed there on our way to Auli, very much worth for a day or two stay.",nishant a,/Profile/Nishhere,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
rudraprayag,"Its a lodge named after the place it is situated in ""Shivanandi - River Lodge"". Its not a lodge, it ain't a hotel, neither its an inn its a Home made by Mr. Shalab and his family with a lot of love, affection, enthusiasm and wild imaginations & innovations.  Placed on the banks of Alakanda river in the foot hills of Garhwal, 10 KMs from Rudraprayag.  The property is located on the down (left side, while coming from Rudraprayag) side of the Badrinath Road (NH 7), so it is not easy to locate, but once you get there you won't like to return soon. You need to trek (400 m) down to the cottages from the road and on the way one can feel he is getting into a jungle, once you reach the main cottage you will feel as if its a secret base which you have discovered, cottages are in red sand",Prashant T,/Profile/PrashantT33,"Mississauga, Canada",50
rudraprayag,"Away from the concrete jungle that I live in, me and my family found heavenly experience at Shivanandi River Lodge. On the banks of Alaknanda River, further ahead of Rudraprayag in a small village called Shivanandi is this magnificent resort / lodge built by Shalabh. I have to name him for the hospitality and personal care that we, especially our kids received.  If you don't want to spend your next holiday in a typical resort (because most offer you similar experience), you must come here to enjoy some wilderness. Breathe fresh air, go for a hike / trekk, do some Kayaking and enjoy camp fire in the night. Its a wonderful way to spend some quality time with your family.  Loved it and am sure to visit again soon",Amitabh B,/Profile/997amitabhb,mumbai,50
rudraprayag,"This is a small homestay style resort. I guess they have close to 6 rooms. The staff and the owner of the place are very friendly and have a good knowledge and understanding of the place. The food is simple, hygienic and tasty. The rooms are clean and cozy. We went in October. I would imagine this place to be very hot and humid between April & Sep. Oct to March would be the best time to visit here.",574chetanm,/Profile/574chetanm,"New DELHI, India",50
rudraprayag,Shalabh and his team are doing a magnificent job to make your stay memorable. The rooms are clean and exactly as described. The food is freshly made of excellent local produce.

rudraprayag,"We stayed in this magical place for 6 nights. At the moment we got there, we immediately felt like we're family. Schalab, Alice and the girls Maya and Shanti welcomed us and made us feel right at home. The place is very calm and quiet, with a private Ganga access which we enjoyed every day. The food is amazing, and the kitchen staff was extremely nice and welcoming. The rooms are very clean and the whole place is very beautiful. They even made a cake for my husband's birthday! There's no doubt this is a place we'll come back to on our next trip to India. Thank you for the amazing experience!游눘",shanisadeh,/Profile/shanisadeh,"Tel Aviv, Israel",50
rudraprayag,"Shiva Nandi River Lodge is one of the most beautiful and loving homestays/retreats/resorts that I have ever been to. I visited the place with my wife and a couple of friends last week.   Reaching Shivanandi: The place is located around 10kms from Rudraprayag and the road that leads up is wonderful. You have to park your car on the road (its completely safe), and I would suggest calling up Shivanandi River Lodge as soon as you reach. Somebody will come to escort you safely to your room and at that very moment you will realize how special this place is. All rooms are river facing and you see the clean water of the Alaknanda raging down the hills.  The People: Shivanandi is family owned and they will make you feel like you are a part of their family. Alice and Shalabh are great",Karan R,/Profile/karanr679,,50

rudraprayag,Really exhausted after a difficult trek we needed a peaceful serenity. Our tour guide guided us to this place ....  We crossed a small water stream to reach this beautiful small lodge right on the river bank of the Ganges...  Beautiful natural organic home. We loved the make of the lodge so natural yet modern. Dogs do welcome you but they are the most friendly dogs..  The food is home cooked and grown nearby. Rooms are cozy and comfortable.  Lovely to sit next to the river and watch her flow in her different moods...  Must visit but they have only 8 rooms so prior booking is a must.. ,amsonik,/Profile/amsonik,"Mumbai, India",40
rudraprayag,"This place looks lovely on trip advisor, bookings.com and its own website. And there are a few things about it which are nice. So I'll start there. They have nice rooms, they are clean, nicely thought out, good bathrooms. The pool is ingenious, plants purify the water as it cascades into the pool area. So the design has good element.s  But and its a really big BUT, for the price, its not at all what it should be. I drove to this place late in the evening on my way to Badrinath. We couldn't find it, we drove up and down, finally someone pointed to a tiny rocky path, that I had to walk down, I ended up on the Ganga river! almost killing myself on the way. Its not in any way paved, or even managed. There is no parking, there is no road access, so my poor driver slept god knows",lisa s,/Profile/279lisas,"San Francisco, California",20
rudraprayag,"Stayed for a few days at the end of April and again at the end of May. Loved every minute of it and everyone there - Shalabh and the little girls, cook, staff, and even the dogs!  Swimming pool is natural and nice but bathing in the river water there is even better.  The architecture is very eco-friendly (stone, mud, etc.) and should inspire a lot more places around India to return to our roots. Food was tasty and seemed mostly organic. Overall great value for money, and your kids will love it too.  Go to bed early because the roosters will wake you up at dawn ! Have fun...",sattvig,/Profile/sattvig,"Auroville, India",50

rudraprayag,"I stayed in Shivanandi for a yoga + hiking retreat. It's a very special place. Location is beautiful, very peaceful, very comfortable and in harmony with the surrounding, + a crazy yoga room. Used to wake up at dawn with the rooster outside my door in front of the river and go to bed after chatting next to the fire after dinner and looking at stars. Food was amazing, cooked with love, healthy and yummy. But most of all the easy going, warm welcome from Shalab and all the super friendly, fun people there, did make the difference.  Because it's maybe easy to find a beautiful place and location, but the athmosphere you find in Shivanandi is something beyond that. Shalab was a superbe guide for the treks, short and long, easy or a bit more challenging, always taking care that",karin_freschi,/Profile/karin_freschi,"Milan, Italy",50

The swimming pool is cool and safe..although one can take a dip in the small lagoon which is formed on the beach......Sitting and watching the rice fields, and the river flowing down below..towering trees..blowing in the gentle breeze..letting time stand still..that is Shivanandi for me...wonderful place for grandparents..like me",pushpa605,/Profile/pushpa605,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50

It nourishes body and soul and you carry back a bag full of beautiful memories of waking up to the sound of gurgling river and chirping birds, sipping tea in beautiful rustic cottage balcony.  The easy relaxed flow of life grows on you. I drifted between my book, paint work and lazy slumber all day long, leisurely watching village women in fields, Kayakers fixing their equipment, butterflies flitting in flowering bushes and majestic cock leading his brood of hen around the garden.  When you have had enough of rocking in the hammock, you can head out for a hike along numerous quaint hill trails that wind up to most amazing hill top view.",kavita p,/Profile/kavitap4,India,50

It was wonderful -  The view, being so close nature and to the river, the day trips to breath taking views, or simply reading a book by the pool -  were all so refreshing and fulfilling.. yet above all - watching my kids being reminded what it's like to be a kid again, swimming, hiking, playing with the incredibly friendly and welcoming Maya, Shanti and their friends from the Shivanandi village was heart warming, not to mention the chance to read a book by the pool :) and finally -  Alice & Shalab's hospitality and company were no less than inspiring.  bottom line -  This was an",Mickey,/Profile/Mickey_s1972,"Ramat Hasharon, Israel",50
