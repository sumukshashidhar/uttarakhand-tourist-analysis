rudraprayag,Stayed at this complex on June 4 while returning from Badrinath. The rooms symbolise typical govt. property with scopes of improvement in both room and washroom. However the prime attraction is the Sangam view from the room portico. GMVN should give proper attention to such beautiful property for the better enjoyment of tourists.,201411pp,/Profile/201411pp,"Naihati, West Bengal, India",30
rudraprayag,"From Badrinath, we went to Joshimath and visited Auli by rope way but failed to see the mountain ranges due to bad weather. From Joshimath we started early morning at 7 am to Rudraprayag 115 km via Pipalkoti and Karnaprayag. We reached Rudraprayag around noon and put up at Rudra Tourist Complex. We took 3 double rooms on the ground floor which is at the level of reception. There is also a floor below and above. The best rooms are on the first floor which are bigger. However all rooms have balconies facing the river and the confluence of Alakananda and Mandakini can be viewed from all rooms. At night one can hear the rumbling sound river and see the lights of Rudranath temple at the confluence. Break fast was complimentary and food options were limited. To visit Rudranath temple",sanjoy68,/Profile/sanjoy68,"Kolkata, India",40
