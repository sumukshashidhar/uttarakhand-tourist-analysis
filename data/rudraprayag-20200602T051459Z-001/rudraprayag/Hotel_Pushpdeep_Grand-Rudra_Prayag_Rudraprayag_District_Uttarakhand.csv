rudraprayag,I stayed in this hotel with my family in May 2018 during chardham yatra. This was the one of the best hotel among all my stays during chardham yatra.Staff is helpful and rooms are also good. Little away from city center but in good location. ,saurabh rathore,/Profile/saurabhr261,"New Delhi, India",40
rudraprayag,"We, a group of 14 members from four families stayed in this hotel for one night. Out of the six rooms we were provided, four rooms did not have water at all and the other two rooms had dirty and myluddy water. When asked the manager kept on saying 'abhee ayegaa'. Dinner provided as a pary of MAP plan was mot at all upto the mark.",chary1962,/Profile/chary1962,"Hyderabad, India",10

rudraprayag,"We stayed for one night. It was off season and there were no guests. The room and bathroom appeared to be relatively clean at first. Later I saw that the toilet seat had spots and asked for it to be cleaned. The towels and sheets were also stained. In the morning when we asked for chai, cockroaches came out of the kettle. The intercom did not work and we had to keep coming down. On the day of our departure, at 15 mins to 12, the manager told us 'kamra khali karo'. When we requested to leave at 1 since our transport would arrive then (and also because my father had had a fall and couldn't move around too much- which the manager was aware of), he refused (although the hotel was empty) but very ""graciously"" allowed us to sit in the lobby. While leaving at check out time is a norm,",Simantini M,/Profile/SimantiniM1,,10
rudraprayag,"I have to admit, i was not expecting much from a hotel in rudraprayag.I went there with friends and stay there for 3 days and night.. every thing was super whether it is room or food  or service .. every thing was super. Price charged by hotel is also good as per facilities and quality services given by them.",SHIVAM C,/Profile/527shivamc,,50
rudraprayag,I was told by  UTTARAKHAND HOLIDAYS ( AJAY BHANDARI) that this is a 3 STAR PROPERTY but it is just like a LOCAL LODGING which we see see outside a Bus stand with no amenities. The exterior of the hotel is maintained to attract the customer but the rooms are TERRIBLE. There is no telephone service for anything you want you have to climb down and tell on Reception even to put on the A/C OR GEYSER you have to come down to reception and tell THE MANAGER then he will put it on  as the controls of AC AND GEYSER are at his counter.I was so much disappointed after looking at the room but I had no choice as the other hotel were already full and this hotel was totaly vacant withonly some rooms occupied.  No one stays in this Hotel as a walk in Customer only the people who are given room,pankaj440,/Profile/pankaj440,"Jalna, India",10
rudraprayag,The best part of this hotel is that it is on the highway. we booked the hotel on our journey back from Chopta and we beat the city traffic the next morning. The hotel had very less staff and they took a lot of time to prepare dinner.  The food is very costly if we consider the quality of food.  In all it is an okay hotel for a nice night stay if you go with very less expectations.,rmnbhanot,/Profile/rmnbhanot,"Chandigarh, Chandigarh, India",30
rudraprayag,"Stayed with some of our officers in this place for a night. The tariff is reasonable and the rooms are spacious, clean and well maintained. The Manager was very friendly when he came to know that I am from Ranchi...as he comes from Bihar (Jharkhand is divided from Bihar), other officers were informing me that before that the Manager wanted us to do the full payment. Over all the place is quiet and clean.",rajpalbhatkar,/Profile/rajpalbhatkar,"Ranchi, India",40
