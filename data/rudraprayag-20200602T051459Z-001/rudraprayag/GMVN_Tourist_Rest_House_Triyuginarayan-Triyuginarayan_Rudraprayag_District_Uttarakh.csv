rudraprayag,"I highly recommend this place due to calm and serene atmosphere and wonderful staffs . Mr Sanjay Bhatt , the manager of this hotel is an amazing individual and helped me throughout my spiritual journey. I had stayed there twice and it‚Äôs one of my best visits so far . Though the facilities are minimal but people make it memorable . The Triyuginarayan temple near my he Hotel is a must visit and such a divine place in mystic Himalayas . Keep doing the great work everyone . Look forward to see you again . God bless you all .",Balagi C,/Profile/balagic,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",50
rudraprayag,"the guest house is located  in a far off place. the only saving grace is the manager Sanjay Bhatt, who is very helpful.( cell no 8755343549) mobile phone signals you can get  in only one corner. the restaurant  guys shows  his face and wonders why  you had come there!!. the food is bad and prepared  on order. so wait for 45 minutes if you want to eat. The rooms are good and  good hot water is available. Stay only if you want to visit  Triyuginnarayan  temple. . The approach road from sonprayag is also bad.",sarangarajan t,/Profile/sarangarajant,,30
rudraprayag,I went to this place with one of my friend from Delhi(who is also  one of the reviewer üòä)around Christmas time in dec 2017. The hospitality shown by the manager in charge and the staff around was really great who made sure that our stay was comfortable. Although the accomodation was at the stage of completion we never felt on missing anything. The place is very close to one of the ancient temples and under the beautiful foothills of a famous trekking path.The manager ensured to provide us a local guide during our trek and we are very much thankful for his services. I would definitely recommend people to have a visit and stay at this place and enjoy serenity at its peak.As a word of reminder as a trekker and nature lover please ensure not to litter and respect the nature.üòäüôè,Krishna A,/Profile/946krishnaa,"Brisbane, Australia",50
rudraprayag,"I visited Triyuginarayan in December 2017. The GMVN resort had just opened at the time and Mr. Sanjay and Mr. Chauhan who manage the resort ensured that the stay was most comfortable. The property itself is very clean and serene, and is located right next to the Triyuginarayan temple, barely a two minute walk away. Will definitely suggest a visit to the place and a stay at this property. Mr. Sanjay and Mr. Chauhan's hospitality is top notch and will make one feel completely at home in the lap of nature. Pro tip: Ask Mr Sanjay to contact Paras and you'll have the most informative guide and companion to the nearby hikes.",RahulRai2018,/Profile/RahulRai2018,"New Delhi, India",50
rudraprayag,"Visited GMVNL TOURIST HOUSE TRIYUGUNARAYAN on 31 st May 2018 along with my family while returning from kedarnathji temple.The location of rest house is significant as it is located near the ancient triyugunarayan temple which is believed to be the place where marriage ceremony of Lord Shiva and goddess Parvati  took place. The rooms of rest house are newly built with good design. Thanks to mr Sanjay Bhatt , manager of rest house for kind support provided. ",santosh Jha,/Profile/santoshjha18,"New Delhi, India",50
rudraprayag,This property by GMVN is brand new and constructed as Chalets.  Inspite of having confirmed booking at Sonpryag we stayed at this place as we liked it so much.  It‚Äôs located in a peaceful setting with great views of snow capped peaks.  The facility are top class and the service is excellent.  We were able to watch champions cup here,Atul A,/Profile/AtulA254,,50
