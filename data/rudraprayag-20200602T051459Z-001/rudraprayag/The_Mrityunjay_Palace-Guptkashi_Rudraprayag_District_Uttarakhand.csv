rudraprayag,Location is good; away from the market but not far. Overlooking mountains. Located on the main road but the traffic is very minimum in the nights.  Service is good. Owner Deepak takes extra interest to make stay comfortable. Prem cooks tasty food in time. Quite spacious room. The only flaw is flow of water in bathroom,Murlidhar S,/Profile/murali_1951,"Bengaluru, India",40

rudraprayag,"Very Simple, Nice and Friendly Hotel for a short stay during the visit to Kedar Valley. My car driver took me to this place around 9:30 PM and even at that time, staff and owner were so friendly and provided me the services promptly. Early morning view of Ukhimath and Sun Rice makes anyone feel like you were somewhere else and not in India.. Food is nice, staff courtesy is great.",sunnix_k,/Profile/sunnix_k,"Hyderabad, India",50

rudraprayag,"Visited Guptkashi in October 2012. Booked this hotel following the other review and was not disappointed. Apart from the clean modern rooms, toilets and excellent views, the hospitality of the owner was excellent. We were so pleased, that we extended the stay for one more night. The helicopter services to Kedarnath are pretty close and can be booked from the hotel itself. Food was on the expensive side, but cleanliness was maintained.",long_drive_lover,/Profile/long_drive_lover,"Tampa, Florida",50
rudraprayag,We have been there in June 2012. The title is aptly suitable for describing Mrityunjay Palace.  Its a small property at nice location. Good views from the balcony n terrace.  Rooms are spacious and not much dumped with furniture so i liked it much with open space. Floor was sparkling clean. Bathroom was clean and of a room size.  Food was the best in whole 10 days trip to Uttrakhand but yes little costly.  Staff was friendly and hospitable.,paruljas11,/Profile/paruljas11,"Jammu City, India",50
