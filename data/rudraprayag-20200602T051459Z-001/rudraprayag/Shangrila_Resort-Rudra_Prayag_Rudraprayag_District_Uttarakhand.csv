rudraprayag,"We stayed here for a stopover for Kedarnath  Positives: On the main road Decent sized rooms  Challenges: Very poor service, Understaffed, If you are planning for early morning vacating the room plan to do all the luggage loading and unloading by yourself.

rudraprayag,"The hotel looks impressive from outside. The rooms were neat, though a bit small.  But the place is far from the main town and sangam, and we may need our own transport. The service is average - perhaps because it was an off day - the hotel manager had left without informing the staff of our booking ( we were a group of 10) and the staff had to manage it just about when we landed up at 9 pm. The dinner order took an hour because of the lack of information.  If you are in transit, the location is great as it is just off the main road, but if you are planning a long stay, I am not sure.",karthikiyengar111,/Profile/karthikiyengar111,"Visakhapatnam (Vizag), India",30

rudraprayag,It is situated about 5 km from the Sangam at Rudraprayag. This is more of a Motel than a hotel.  Pros  1. Location - Good scenic view 2. Rooms - Clean  Cons  1. Poor management  2.

rudraprayag,Nice location and spacious rooms. Owner and staff was very helpful.  Rudraprayag is sangam of alaknand and mandakini. I like the koteswar temple here. Really worth to visit.

rudraprayag,"Located 3-4 km from the town and 5 km from the Sangam, the place is high up on the mountain, with the river Alaknanda barely visible far away down in the gorge. The hotel has many rooms of all types and a large parking area. There is also a nice dining area. The rooms and washrooms are very basic. The bedsheets had tiny holes. The blankets did not seem to be properly washed and had no cover. The only plug point other than the one for the old TV set was not working. There is no set top box, only cable connection with a lot of noise and few channels. The inlet and outlet valves of the geyser were leaking. Despite the hotel having a large generator, there was no electricity the entire morning until 10 minutes before we left.",A S,/Profile/anirbansm,,30

rudraprayag,"I have been staying in Shangrila Resort since I've started travelling to Badrinath-Kedarnath. Situated in the outskirts of the main city, it gives you a nice, homely & secure environment where you can just sit back and relax. The Weather is always Awesome due to one of the biggest asset of the Resort i.e. a huge FIG tree which provides a cool breeze that refreshes up your mind.  MANAGEMENT : The Mangement is quite disciplined as Mr. Rajendra Chamola, (a good to interact guy) manages it very wisely. Complaints & Requests(if any) are processed in the blink of an eye.

With his cab he provides u with a driver whose name is MOTI (he is the worst driver i have met in my life.Very rude and arrogant guy.).The worst part was that when we complained about him to mr. jagdish then he turned a deaf ear to ourselves and took the side of his driver.But one thing  that i would like to mention is that young boys who work here are very humble and hardworking.So if anyone dearly wants to spoil his trip,then hotel Shangrila in Rudraprayag is a must-must visit place.Even after",gupta_Rajnish,/Profile/gupta_Rajnish,Gurgaon,10
rudraprayag,Please do not go by the web site photographs. They mislead you. This is a terrible hotel. It is situated on the way to Rudraprayag. It is 4 kms far from the market where you get jeeps to go to any place further. You cannot obviously walk the distance with your luggage and the climb is steep. If you have come by bus or jeep from Rishikesh or Haridwar then you have had it as there is absolutely no transport to the market at Rudraprayag. You have to catch the public jeep by 8 am and it is absolutely impossible. The owner may say there is a bus stop opposite the hotel but the bus is impossible to get or impossible to get in if it comes. The rooms are terrible and the sheets are cheap. The AC does not work and the control is also with the Owner who puts it off if  he sees you coming,hariharan15,/Profile/hariharan15,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",10
rudraprayag,"A few good things first - The young boys serving you at this resort are quite enthusiastic. They won't say no even if they need to climb the stairs to second floor frequently to serve you. The hotel's overall ambience is good more because of overall layout and its surroundings.   The upkeep of the hotel room / bathroom is less than average. The worse part of the stay-experience at this hotel was the interaction with its owner. The feedback on 'spicy and stale' food did not go well with him and he had no reservation about shouting back at his customer for such a feedback.  Further to a query on availability of lift to climb up second floor (I was accompanying my old parents), his response was ""Hotels here are for two months business only!
