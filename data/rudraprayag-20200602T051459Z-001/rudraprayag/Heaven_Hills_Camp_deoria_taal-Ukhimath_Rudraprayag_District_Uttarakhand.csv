rudraprayag,We had a wonderful one night stay at Heaven Hills Camp. We reached there late night at around 10 PM & Devendra was already there to welcome us. He is one the amazing host we have met so far. He even prepared special food on demand for us as requested. I totally recommend this place for camp stay at deoria Tal.,tarun b,/Profile/tarunb515,"Chandigarh, India",50
rudraprayag,"Monsoon were approaching and My friends and i got our trip plan done. Deoriya Tal was in our list as we heard about its beautifulness and charming scenarios. I searched for camping there and with a little research i found very positive reviews for heaven hills camps especially for the owner Devender singh. We called him and talked about our scheduled plan. The day we reached Sari village (trek starts here) we met Devender singh and he welcomed us cordially and managed our baggages and helmets. In the whole trek we enjoyed his presence. As soon as we reached we reached Deoriatal,i was mesmerised by its surroundings, the Nature's own. Then we stayed at heaven hills camps. Stay and food were outstanding.To be honest,i found those guys very humble and genuine.literally i was",Deepak,/Profile/Dpkchamoli,,50

rudraprayag,"Yes, this place is indeed heaven on earth. Heaven's hill camps situated hidden on the top of Deoriatal trek, in a serene place secluded by Mountains. Devendra was our host. He is also local,from Sari Village. I never met a Pahari who is not nice and warm. When I travel, I prefer local guides, local food, homestay. Without their touch I believe my journey remains incomplete. They brings you more close to the heart of the place unlike commercial tourism companies. Heaven's hill camps are clean, spacious, facility with tidy toilets and yummy food. They takes all your tantrums with a big smile and in a very cheap rate compare to that. I would strongly recommend you to book Heaven's Hill camps if you like serenity and stay at the top for atleast a night, enjoy the stars before you",Sayani B,/Profile/SayaniB26,,50
