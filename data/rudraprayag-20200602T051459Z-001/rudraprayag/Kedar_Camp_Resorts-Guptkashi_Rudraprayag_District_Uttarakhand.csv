rudraprayag,"Every year, I spend at least 2 weeks at Kedar Camp Resorts. This is a very unique place in many aspects : location, energy, calmness, cleanliness, food, service... The staff is always keen to help you to offer you the best experience possible. Wonderful panorama on the Himalayan mountains with, among others, the snowy peaks of Chaukhamba and Kedarnath. Perfect place to explore the area : Kedarnath temple, Tungnath temple and Chandra Chila summit, walks in the traditional villages...
