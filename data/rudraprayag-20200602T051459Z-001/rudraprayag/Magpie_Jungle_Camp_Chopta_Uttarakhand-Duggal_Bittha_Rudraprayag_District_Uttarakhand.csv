rudraprayag,"Chopta is a beautiful place near Gopeshwar, Uttarakhand. There a number of small bhugyals around Chopta surrounded by alpine forests. Magpie jungle camp is one among many ""eco camps"" (a cluster of swiss cottage tents) in the area. It is around 10 km from Chopta. The camp is situated at the edge of a small bhugyal and is surrounded by a thick forest. While being very accessible it is not situated right on the road, unlike some other camps. To reach the camp you have to walk a few hundred meters on a easy track through the forest. We were a group of 11 of varying ages from 14 to 68. It is hidden from the road and gives you a feeling of being really away from the bustle of the civilisation. We were there during first week of December, which is not the best time to be there.

They only provide heavy razai which surprisingly do not give any warmth.   For bathing water you are required to go to one hamam, stand in a queue, get  ur own bucket of water, and carry it for about 500 meters to your tent. So if u r above 35 or suffering from a back problem, it is safer to go without a bath !!!  The staff is arrogant and unhelpful. They will stand and watch u struggling with the water bucket and offer no help. They also have to be literally threatened to carry ur luggage to the vehicle, a distance of about a  kilometer.

Finally we came across an article about this place chopta. The photographs enticed us and we finalized it.
