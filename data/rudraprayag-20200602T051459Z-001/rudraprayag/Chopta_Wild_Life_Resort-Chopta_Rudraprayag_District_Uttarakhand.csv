rudraprayag,We group of 9 friends stayed at chopta wildlife camps from 23-24dec . Camp is situated appox 400mtr from main road and has an awesome campsite . We were mesmerized with the beauty of surroundings and overwhelm with the great hospitality of camp owners - charchit and Saurabh . These guys gave their 100% efforts to made our stay so memorable . As the temperature was in minus but still in such adverse  scenario these guys made all possible efforts to provide us every single amenity which we demanded. Will highly recommend this camp  in chopta .,Rakesh J,/Profile/rakeshjoshionline,"New Delhi, India",50
rudraprayag,"What a scenic place , like living in dream. The camps are so beautifully positioned so as not to block the view of the valley or the snow capped Himalayas as though it was straight out of a painting . The camps were warm enough and sufficient for a family . They are kept very clean and well maintained .and warm too . When we went it rained a bit in the night so it was really cold . The bathrooms are so clean and have provided all basic amenities . Hotel runs on solar so the electricity is available only from 6 pm . Please carry battery pack for mobile recharging . The hosts are really humble and ready to assist always with a smile . The package includes stay and food . If you want non veg please inform them three days before as the market is not close by. The staff working there",Vij65,/Profile/Vij65,"Mumbai, India",50
