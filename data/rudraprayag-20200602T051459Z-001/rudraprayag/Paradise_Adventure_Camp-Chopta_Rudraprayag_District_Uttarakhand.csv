rudraprayag,"Chopta is a mesmerizing and enchanting place to visit. Paradise adventure camp is the best place to stay if you are there. Very comfortable accommodation in terms of neat clean tents and place. They provide all amenities and work hard to make the stay as comfortable. The staff is ever helpful. The food is like home. Special mention for Mr. Alok Baijal for making this a wonderful place to stay. Tip for the first timers.. It is a camp so no network, no wi fi, no TV. It is that prefect digital, mental, physical detox zone. With Friends it was awesome, though with children along it could be a little off beat so be prepared.",PTK,/Profile/tranquilpk,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40

I had been to “Paradise Adventure Camp” with my wife in the mid of Dec 2017. One of my senior colleague had visited this place a few years ago, but he stays in Rubraprayag. I wanted to stay at Chopta and climb Tungnath & Chandrashila after seeing their photographs.   Me & my wife reached there around early evening. We were accommodated in one tent. You have to park your vehicles on the road beside the campsite. The moment we move around the tents and",Debmalya C,/Profile/148debmalyac,,50
