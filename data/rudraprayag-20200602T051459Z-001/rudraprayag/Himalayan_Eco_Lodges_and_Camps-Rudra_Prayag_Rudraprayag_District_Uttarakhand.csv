rudraprayag,"GIO Adventures had said that come in October 2019 to get brilliant views. We booked a custom family (2 adults and 2 kids) trek for Chopta,Tungnath in the first week of OCtober. The lodge as such is very basic. Smelly linens and rooms,bathroom sink drain was blocked.   It was constantly raining during the day and we went too late on both days and didnt get any views of mountains from either Deoriatal or Tungnath. The guide refused to take us to Chandrashila stating that we would return late to the lodge.  The driver that Gio Adventures sent was constantly  harassing us for money for petrol even though we had paid in full online. This so called lodge based is totally not worth it.",nishavk,/Profile/nishavk,"Chennai, India",10

The property is in the hills just before embarking on the Kedarnath trial. So it would be a good stopover before heading to Kedar. It is an ideal spot to visit the nearby attractions like Ukhimath, Kartikaswamy Temple and a host of other attractions. The flight of steps to get down are a bother if you are travelling with elders, but otherwise the manager with his able team ensures you have a comfortable stay.
