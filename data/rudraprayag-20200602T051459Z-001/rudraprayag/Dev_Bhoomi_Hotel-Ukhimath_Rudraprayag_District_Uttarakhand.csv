rudraprayag,"Stayed in this property for single night during a trip to Tungnath; The location is just at the main market area, so you can get the buses very comfortably. Also there are few fooding options outside, but not much. I could not find any running restaurant there at the hotel during our stay. The rooms were fine, and was as communicated at the booking time. One can get a nice view of the mountain peaks direct from the terrace itself.",Arnab K.,/Profile/rnbknd,"Kolkata, India",30
rudraprayag,"If this is the best that Ukhimath has to offer in terms of accommodation then God save Ukhimath.   Pros: Situated right next to the bus stand. Cons: Curtains too thin, holes and gaps in doors, vents above doors which could act as peeping channels for hidden cams outside [Creepy, especially for women]. And although there is an inverter, fans do not work during power cuts.  Luckily, only one of us managed to have a bath with hot water as we had already turned the geyser on as soon as we had arrived. And strangely the fan does not work under inverter during power cuts.  The owner who seems to be mentally challenged took great offense when I called and pointed it out that the fan was not working. He came out on the street from his restaurant shouting like crazy that the power had",Rishi G,/Profile/rishiblock,,10
rudraprayag,Bestest place to stay in ukhimath as it exactly in the main market from where you get bus and all other facilities.as there is no more scope in this place you get the best thing and the receptionist guy Mr. Jeetendra who manages the property is really friendly and helpful he took care of us as his own family.,Vaibhav K,/Profile/58vaibhavk,"Dehradun, India",50
rudraprayag,"Hotel is small but clean & well maintained, rooms were clean, Food was simple & Delicious.. Hotel Owner Mr Jitendra Rana was very helpful & cooperative , in fact our trip got rescheduled & he changed our booking dates without paying extra. We stayed here for 2 Days & 2 Nights. We stayed here to visit Chopta & Tunganath, as Chopta is in between jungle & remote and Hotels nearby do not have electricity or other facilities so if travelling with kids then staying in remote is not a viable option so stayed in Ukhimath which is hardly 28 kms from Chopta. So overall a Nice place to stay if travelling nearby or Chopta with family.",Pioneer825164,/Profile/Pioneer825164,,50

rudraprayag,This hotel is the only comfortable stay in Ukhimath. They have newly renovated the hotel that makes it a comfortable stay. Hotel has clean and big room with clean toilets and hot water facility which is very rare at that place. So if you are on the way to your 'Yatra' or visiting Chopta and need a comfortable stay then go for this hotel only. Advance booking is recommended. I will recommend the two front rooms on top floor from where you can have a view of snow covered peaks and these two rooms are best.  Prices vary from 700-1200 depending on the demand and bargaining. Food is a problem throughout Ulhimath and nearby places and with this hotel also. For room service you need to go to the Dhaba of the hotel and ask there. You will get very basic food like Aloo parantha and daal,Kartik T,/Profile/KartikT52,"Nainital, India",30

rudraprayag,"I have stayed in this hotel twice now and the second time I chose this for its convenience. It is right on the main market and bus stand. The GMVN or the Bharat Sevashram Sangha rest houses are very good but you have to walk uphill to get public transport. The Ukhimath market is quite interesting, as most hill markets are, and for me the slow quietening of the road as evening progresses has its own charm. You get good view of the Kedar Peak from the balcony. The rooms here are nice - they have renovated recently. The bathrooms are okay. You have hot water round the clock. The food option is somewhat disappointing as the restaurant is not the cleanest one. But there are not many options around. You can negotiate the rent. Overall, I have had satisfactory experiences.",Siddhartha Biswas,/Profile/Siddharthabiswas,"Kolkata, India",30
rudraprayag,"(well maintained and clean rooms, they also serve good food, value for money, nice service) Visited as a base for tungnath trek in the month of may, just before the commencement of yatra, the hotel is in the main bus stand, so you can easily get bus srvices directly in front of hotel. Famous temple of Omkareshwar is only half kilometer away.There is a great view from the hotel terrace, you can enjoy the sunset from hotel it self. Apart from this the owner of this hotel was also helpful.  ",Kapil S,/Profile/KapilS61,,50
