rudraprayag,"This hotel is just beside national highway and this is highly decorated from outside. Rooms are spacious, but sufficient light is absent in many rooms. After asking room can be changed for this purpose. For cooking and taking food, a lot of space is available outside. From Rudraprayag to Badrinath, this is an important hotel. Boys are helpful.",soumeng2016,/Profile/soumeng2016,"Kolkata, India",50
rudraprayag,200 room property. We were the only occupants hence no manpower. Rooms are not maintained properly. Any complaint room is changed. The upkeep is very poor  This hotel is meant to one night stay and forget. No review is required.  Food is up to the mark. You get only what they have. ,Venkateswar,/Profile/Venkateswar,"Navi Mumbai, India",40

rudraprayag,"We had stayed in Balbir Palace for 02 night during our trip to chardhamyatra we were 47 of us It’s a big property with a good location on Highway. Rooms are spacious with balconies, Bathrooms are ok But despite all these positives, they lack professionalism which is must in service sector. There was a  water logging problem in bathrooms during our stay, guests complained to them but they did not paid much attention & the buckets in the bathroom were not clean some had hole at the bottom. We had a 2 night stay.The staff was rude as this property belongs to some political guy so the staff thinks they can do what ever they want pay no heed to the customers  . Their own staff was roaming here n there in the corridors, talking loudly to each other. i will not recommend staying at",sachiin76,/Profile/sachiin76,"Mumbai, India",10

rudraprayag,"We have stayed in Balbir Palace for 01 night during our trip to Kedarnath and Badrinath. It’s a big property with a good location on Highway. Rooms are spacious with balconies, Bathrooms are OK, they have a small restaurant but good food...we took our Dinner there, Nice reception area, own parking ….  But despite all these positives, they lack professionalism which is must in service sector. There was a little water problem in bathrooms during our stay, guests complained to them but they did not paid much attention. We have a one night stay only so it dint bothered us much but still gives a bad impression of the Hotel. They were not rude but even not hospitable. Their own staff was roaming here n there in the corridors, talking loudly to each other. These were the small things",paruljas11,/Profile/paruljas11,"Jammu City, India",30
rudraprayag,I paid $75 for a night at this terrible hotel. extremely poor service and bad filthy rooms. they turn off the airconditioner every 2 hours and you have to call them to request them to turn it on again. apparently they run the hotel purely with their international groups being conned into the block bookings. neiher does the location compare to the monal resort or  GVM hotel near by who have the prayag view. The owner is rude to say the least. if you are NOT doing a pious trip to Badri/kedar then definately dont consider this hotel as it doesnt have neither allows bar drinks.,skhemka,/Profile/skhemka,"New Delhi, India",10
