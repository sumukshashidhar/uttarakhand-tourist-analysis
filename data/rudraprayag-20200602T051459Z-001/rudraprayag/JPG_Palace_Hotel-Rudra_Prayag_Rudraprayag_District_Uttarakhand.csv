rudraprayag,"This is just an average hotel standing on Kedarnath Highway just before Sonprayag. The hotel building looks royal from outside, but the rooms have only basic amenities and basic cleanliness.The pillows,mattresses and blankets are all old with some stains.The food options are limited to Veg Thaali and Tea.It is just an aegare option if you just want to spend one night on way to Kedarnath with a small budget.",anjan s,/Profile/18anjans,"Raipur, India",30
rudraprayag,"You will be impressed with the exterior of the Hotel, but mind you this is a very basic hotel with very complex room numbers, It has 84 rooms in all, and the rooms are randomly numbered - 63 is on the top floor, 65 is at the basement, and 61 somewhere in the middle. Lack of professionalism in allocating the rooms, you should be thankful to get the rooms even after you have booked.",Ketan27,/Profile/Ketan27,"Thane, India",20
rudraprayag,"I stayed here with my family. Hotel is situated near Sonprayag, place to start Kedarnath Temple journey.  Hotel is having rooms with attached bathroom.  No TV, No Fridge, No ALMIRA, No Good Mattress, No Room Service, No food/snacks, No Menu Card and food is only at fixed timings. Very Polluted atmosphere all around the hotel as it is situated on road. Please be informed that this is actually a basic accommodation hotel only, please don't expect anything here.",CEODS,/Profile/CEODS,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",10
