rudraprayag,"We went to Jakholi after a harrowing tour of Rudranath. This I believe is the perfect spot for the kind of rest we were looking for. The is literally the end of the road. About two hours from Tilwara (and approx 38 km from Rudraprayag) this village is quiet, sparsely populared and very friendly. The GMVN bungalow is established on top of the highest hill and presents you with spectacular view of the Nanda Devi and the Kedarnath ranges. The Bungalow is perfectly located and the rooms are good. The people there are friendly. When we were there renovations were going on, and we were the only guests. That gave us more peace and quiet and the staff took very good care of us. The Manager is helpful and is a gentleman. If you feel bored then you can hire a car and go to Badani Lake",Siddhartha Biswas,/Profile/Siddharthabiswas,"Kolkata, India",50

rudraprayag,"You won't get to stay at such locations frequently. Full night the sound of both the rivers are accompanying you. Though the hotel is old, Food here is very nice, so as the hospitality. They should improve on cleanliness and reduce rates little bit.",shreyas w,/Profile/180shreyasw,"Mumbai, India",40
rudraprayag,It is meant for the people who really loves nature and want to be away from crowd for some time. The snow clad Kedarnath range of mountain is visible from the terrace and from the room of this TRH. The Manager as well as the staffs are very humble and the price of the food is also cheap. It's 200 km from Dehradun. Anyone can go via either Rudra Prayag or Chamba - Tehri - Ghansali - Mayali. Very good place for weekend tour.,abhijitghosh12003,/Profile/abhijitghosh12003,"Dehradun, India",40
rudraprayag,"it's a most amazing experience to stay in this guest house. you  feeling so close to nature and god. we chose the room which was in the end of the  corridor because me having some physical limitations wanted the bathroom with the jet  spray facility and that bathroom had it. The bed was low but the staff was so kind to put  another mattress to make it higher for me. The room was clean decent. the best part we  open the balcony and it opens to the pure waters of ganga flowing along, it felt as if i was on the bed of the river there was a mandir that you can see on the other side of the river  so we did not need to go all the way from there to attend the aarti as we could hear it  sitting in the balcony, what else could you ask for, the lucky me that i am...close to god's  nature",wheelchairandeye,/Profile/Pammu_Parvinder,"Mumbai, India",50
