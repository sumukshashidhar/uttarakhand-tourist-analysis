rudraprayag,"We stayed at Gujarat Bhawan, Phata in May 2017 on our way to Kedarnath and also on our way back from Kedarnath.  It was a very comfortable stay.  The rooms are good, bathrooms are also OK and the best part ws the balcony all around in front of all the rooms.  That meant we could sit outside the room and enjoy the weather and the scenery.  The hotel is on the main road and so we had no trouble finding it and our bus dropped us at the entrance only.  It is also in the midst of the small bazaar at Phata.  The food is not only wholesome but cooked like home cooked food and so we found it good as we are senior citizens and do not like very oily food.  On the whole, I would certainly recommend Gujarat Bhawan to anyone wishing to stay at Phata",agtari,/Profile/agtari,"Varanasi, India",50
rudraprayag,"Gujarat Bhawan is located in the main market in Phata. It was classified as Deluxe hotel by my travel agent but it turned out to be a better version of a Dharamshala. Staff is helpful and supportive. The hotel has small rooms, bedsheets and quilts were not very clean,bathrooms had geysers and western toilets and food was nice/homely. I stayed on the ground floor and my room did not had any TV or storage space.Overall this place is an average stay.",Prakriti A,/Profile/PrakritiA14,,30

rudraprayag,"I and my mother had stayed in this hotel from 5th May,2015 to 6th May,2015 on our journey to Kedarnath Temple. This hotel is near the helipad of Pawan Hans. The hotel is a nice stay for one night as the rooms are not very neat and clean. The room rates are are reasonable. The rooms are well equipped with Geysers, TV sets with cable connection, western style toilets and storage facilities, etc. The rooms are well carpeted and spacious. The food is also good and averagely priced compared to hotels in Dehradun and Hardwar. The staff are locals and are well behaved. There are several places of visit near the hotel. There is a small market in and around the hotel. Our stay was a pleasant one.",Sandweep,/Profile/Sandweep,"Pune, India",30
