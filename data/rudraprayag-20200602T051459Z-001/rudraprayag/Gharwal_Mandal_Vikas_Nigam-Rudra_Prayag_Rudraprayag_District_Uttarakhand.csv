rudraprayag,"One thing which promptly comes in mind- Wow, what a location! This year, we had planned an 'unplanned' vacation. Out of total 7 days, only 2 days in between were booked at Auli. Rest all was thought to stay wherever we reach comfortably in a day. More so due to traffic and road conditions.  First day, checked at GMVN Srinagar, not rooms. Called Rudraprayag, happy to know AC room available. Checked in. Opened balcony door, and all 4 of us family were elated ! the great god Rudra's place on the holy sangam was just a few aerial meters! We all set in balcony whole evening. Soaked in sounds of Aaarti, the serene environment and calm murmur of the confluence.   Rooms are typical govt property types- not to expect great, not bad. Linen was promptly changed on request. Food was great.",kcpdelhi,/Profile/kcpdelhi,"New Delhi, India",40
rudraprayag,"We travelled here on our way from Mussoorie to Auli and stayed here one night to break the long travel. This is a great place run by the Govt and the rooms are very spacious and clean. The views from the balcony is splendid and you can watch the Rudraprayag Sangam of Alaknanda and Mandakini rivers right from the baclony!! Added to this, you can witness the evening Ganga aarti as well from the balcony of your room :)The toilets need rennovation. As is the case with most of the Govt run hotel, this is also on an unparalleled location and very well built - just needs to be maintained that way and renovated periodically. The food is good and the manager ensure we get what we wanted - kudos to the manager, who is a young enthusiastic person.

rudraprayag,"There are multiple entries for the Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam (GMVN) Rudraprayag on Tripadvisor. The name of the facility is Rudra Tourist Complex. While traveling with my parents I initially considered staying at Monal Resort (4 kms outside Rudraprayag) or Hotel Mandakini (2 kms outside). However thanks to my fathers preference for government hotels we booked ourselves at GMVN. Best thing about the place is its location. Every room has a balcony that looks out to the sangam of River Mandakini and River Alakananda. Being a bit away from the main road its quiet and peaceful Staff are good though not extremely proactive (as you can expect from govt employees) Food is quite ok.

All rooms have balconies facing the rivers hence each room offers the view of the confluence.
