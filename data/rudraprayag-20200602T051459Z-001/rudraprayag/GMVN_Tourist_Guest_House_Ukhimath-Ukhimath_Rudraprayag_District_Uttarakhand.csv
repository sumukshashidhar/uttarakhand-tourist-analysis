rudraprayag,On my way to Badrinath from Kdernath out off  9 times I stayed 3 times in GMVN Ukhimath Tourist Lodge. I enjoyed the staying at Ukhimath all times. This year also we spent a day in GMVN ukhimath which was unbelievable experience in  life. The beautiful picturesque Lodge and the heartiest service of the supporting staffs including reception and behavior of the Manager is a memorable experience in my life.

rudraprayag,It's the best place at Ukhimath to stay. We booked for 2 days and stayed there. The fooding and lodging is excellent. Manager and staffs are very helpful polite and cooperative.

rudraprayag,Ukhimath guest house is a small guest house with less rooms but good one. It's a stoppage to rest if u want to visit Tunganath via Chopta. As no guest house of GMVN is available in Chopta so Ukhimath is an ideal one. Rooms r good. Staff very good nd cooperative. Recommended,Amit Agarwal,/Profile/AmitA2071,"Howrah, India",40
rudraprayag,"Stayed here for a day and had a lovely experience. Drove from Joshimath to Ukhimath via Chamoli, Gopeshwar, Chopta. Stopped over at Chopta for some breathtaking views, had lunch at a dhabha and drove here. This is one of the small properties of GMVN where there are only 3 Delux rooms and 8 dormitories. We had pre-booked a delux room so didn't have trouble getting in. We checked in and within sometime there was rain and hailstorm and it was dark all around, at 2PM. However by 3 the sky cleared out and we had a wonderful view of the mountains around Kedarnath.

rudraprayag,"We visited during 19th October 2017, Diwali holidays. Its really a nice place to stay. There are only two rooms and 8 bed dormitory available, so early booking would be a wise decision. The rooms are not very luxurious but the best as per the location and rent (990rs only). The caretaker Rajesh is a wonderful person, he cooked good food and also arranged vendor who would set up our camp in deoriya tal. There are another two cottages in front but they are not available for online booking. After reaching there we paid him extra to spend one night in that cottage. Wonderful experience. He even prepared local cuisine, manduwa roti & jhangoora kheer for us.We enjoyed every part of our stay here.",rajeshwarisht15,/Profile/rajeshwarisht15,"New Delhi, India",50
rudraprayag,With two rooms and a dormitory.... Spacious and with amazing view of Guptkashi. The hotel is nice and extremely clean and well kept in the price range it offers. The caretaker has amazing culinary skills and is extremely hospitable and friendly. It serves as a great base camp for Tungnath Trek and Deoria tal trek each of which is within 30 kms from here. In this area it's a must stay.,Angon B,/Profile/angonb,"Kolkata, India",40
rudraprayag,"We stayed here for couple of nights while we were visiting chopta. We stayed in a room. It has a dorm also, and now they are constructing additional rooms. Like everywhere else in himalayas, staff is very nice and they cook great food. The rooms are ordinary but solve all your functionals needs- warm water, not dirty, beds and linens. It's not a luxury so don't come here if you are too fussy about your specific needs. If weather allows it, you should have tea in the nice little garden. If you are lucky, you can see beautiful view of mountains in the morning.",Dinesh S,/Profile/750dineshs,,40

rudraprayag,"Ukhimath is a small town with limited staying options. The GMVN guest house is located just off the main road, on the slope facing Guptkashi. The Mandakini flows far down in the gorge and offers only a glimpse from the left corner of the lawn, which also presents with unobstructed views of the Kedarnath and Kedar dome peaks. The Ukhimath temple is only a 5 minutes drive. There is a small well-maintained lawn with parking space in front of the building. The single-storeyed guest house has only 2 double-bed rooms and one dormitory which can be booked online. It also has a cottage room just below the lawn, but this one is not shown on the website.

We were very disappointed on arrival. We found that our online booking details had not been received at the hotel, though it was quickly sorted out. The dormitory was a big disappointment.

And if you keep this place as a part of tourist itinerary, there can't be a better option than staying in GMVN guest house. The property was damaged in the devastating earthquake a few years back. Only two rooms and a dormitory of 11 beds are there. As usually, any GMVN hotels are located in the best possible place and here too the hotel has the best views. I had a plan of passing a couple of nights here and a couple of nights in Chopta and Sari. Eventually I ended up staying here for four nights.

rudraprayag,The hotel was destroyed in the floods so they currently have a dormitory of 10 beds and 2 rooms. Other rooms are being built so in a year it will be done. We stayed here after visiting Tungnath as we were tired and needed a place to rest. The hotel staff are very friendly and keeps the property clean. Food here depends on the raw materials available as the person will go to shop after you have placed the order. Its freshly made so keep in mind to order atleast 2 hours before. The service is quite good but this is more of a guest house rather than a hotel.  View is good from the hotel and good option for staying for a night. Ukhimath Temple is at a walking distance from the hotel however you can take your car also to avoid steps. The hotel already started renovation and building,Agni M,/Profile/traveller963,Calcutta,30
rudraprayag,"The best part of it is that its not a hotel but 90% of the property is individual cottage type. Some are very big and some smaller but not too small. The food is very good compared to the remoteness. You can also customise your lunch and dinner menu based on availability of raw materials.  The best part is the view from here. The Sunset will be better than the sunrise given the angle at which you can see the Kedar Peaks and range.  Service also is quite good and so is the cleanliness of the rooms at just Rs 800/- to Rs 1000/- per night.

It was raining and getting late, so we dropped our plan to reach Rudraprayag and stopped over at GMVN Ukhimath. It's a small tourist rest house with 2 room, one dormitory (8 beds) room and a small lawn. View from the lawn is spectacular with hills and snow clad mountains. Room No. 1 is the best option. Beds were clean, specious WC, hot water available for 24X7, Food is freshly cooked. The kitchen & dining hall is hygienic.  The staffs are courteous, helpful and prompt.

rudraprayag,Almost 200kms away from Haridwar lies Ukhimath at an elevation of 1311 metres.  A 7hrs+ journey from Haridwar by road took us to this place famous as the winter abode of the panch Kedars. Wnt say the road conditions were good. All along the road was full of pits and blocks due to rains and constant constructions. However the views were worth the pain. On reaching Ukhimath it was time to find a place to stay. We would have preferred more discreet locations like a forest camp or little known hotels in Chopta. But with the rains considering land-slide probabilities and commuting limitations we settled for the GMVNL Tourist Guest House. Overlooking the verdant Guptakashi valley the guest house was a treat to be in.
