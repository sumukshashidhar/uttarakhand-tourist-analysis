rudraprayag,"WORST EXPERIENCE!!!!! AWFULL!!! I and my wife checked in to this hotel after our wedding , a suite was booked for us , we checked in at night and there was no service by the staff.  The staff is really rude and was abusive to even the owner stepped into the arguments in the morning at 8.30 and was abusive too.  The owner has no sense to talk to customer, especially if the guest has booked a ""Suite""  WORST!!! Will never ever recommend it to anyone, especially with family, the staff will humiliate you like anything.  DO NOT EVER BOOK",ashishsingh7271,/Profile/ashishsingh7271,"New Delhi, India",10
rudraprayag,"I stayed for a night, and found that the place was quiet, but the rooms were not properly clean. The place is at a good location. Much can be done to maintain the place and get good number of customers.  Did not have any food hence can not say anything about the food quality.",rajpalbhatkar,/Profile/rajpalbhatkar,"Ranchi, India",30
