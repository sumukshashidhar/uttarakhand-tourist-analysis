rudraprayag,Worst Experience Ever. No Hot Water arrangements. This Camp is overpriced. Owner does not stand by his promises. Owner's behavior is very very bad. Both the Staffs at Camp are nice. They managed our stay somehow.,Shashank Shekhar,/Profile/shashankshekhar17129,,10
rudraprayag,Very unprofessional behavior from owner. No commitment towards customers. Very limited staff. Used expired food items like green chilli sauce etc. Tents were dirty and blankets were smelling bad. They asked for 1600 per person which was much higher than other tents in the area in off season.,Sandeep,/Profile/Sandy06795,,10
rudraprayag,"Tungnath is one of my favorite destination and now i found a perfect location to stay with family. Quality of camps can't be better in Chopta. Camps are clean, quality stuff, hygienic. Peaceful surroundings and most important no internet so no whatsapp, facebook or any other distraction. Just enjoy the beauty of nature . Food is homely and kids enjoyed the open area. Service is good, friendly owner and experienced manager to take care of guests.",shamsher singh karki,/Profile/sskarki,,50
