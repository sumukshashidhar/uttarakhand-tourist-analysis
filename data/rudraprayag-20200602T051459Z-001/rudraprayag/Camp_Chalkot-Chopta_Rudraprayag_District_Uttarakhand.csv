rudraprayag,"We stayed at chalkot camp as a part of trekking trip of GIO - Himalayan Eco Lodges. The place was near chopata on the road to makku village. It is off road camp site. We have to trek almost 300 meteres in the dense jungle to reach the campsite. But the place was so fabulous and amazing that you instantly forget all the pains you had taken to reach the place. There is huge ground in midst of a dense jungle. You cannot hear the voices of vehicles. The only sounds heard were of the neighbouring spring of water, birds and occasionally wild animals (if lucky).  All the set up was in tents but all the basic facilities were perfectly provided with nice bathrooms and hot water. As there is no electricity available, you can see the sky full of stars like you haven't seen before. Although",shivang patel,/Profile/shivangp29,"Vellore, India",50
rudraprayag,"I stayed at Camp Chalkot while treking in Garhwal region with Foliage Outdoors group. Each family in the group was allotted a separate tent with two beds and two sleeping bags. Tents were sturdy,  equipped with double zipper and net making sure no unwanted guests enter at night. :)  Gents and Ladies have designated Toilets and bathrooms. Water was fetched from nearby fresh water stream. We enjoyed freshly cooked food and campfire at night.  There is no electricity at the campsite and you may get mobile network sometimes if you are lucky. Ifs recommend to carry individual torch. We just soked in the tranquility forgetting mobile phones and electronic gadgets.",bharatabhyankar,/Profile/bharatabhyankar,"Mumbai, India",50
