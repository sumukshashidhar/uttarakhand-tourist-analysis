haridwar,It's not a very beautiful looking property. The rooms are fine. But you also have to take into account that is a low priced hotel. For the price I think this is a pretty good hotel. The staff is helpful. The food is nice. The only thing is that they need to maintain the hotel. There was dust all around the room. ,Harshit A,/Profile/HarshitA136,,30
haridwar,"I visited Haridwar on 8th January, 2013 for 2 days and after a very good stay and enjoyable time at hotel in Mussorie, this place was quite a disappointment. The only plus point was its location and room service boy. The room service boy was a cheerful person. Rest everything about this hotel was terrible. The rooms were in very poor condition and need maintenance; The food tasted bad; The lightings in the room was poor; the bathroom flush was not working; The room bell was also not functioning and they didn't even have any telephones in the room. I had to take the room boy's mobile number to call him for any service. Their charges for extra blankets and heaters are also pretty high. There are several other good options in the vicinity and i won't recommend this hotel.",Abhishek A,/Profile/AbhishekA535,"Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India",20
