haridwar,The place was quite decent under the budget. its located near Lakshman jhula and was on a hilltop.  the view from the hotel was pretty good. it is at walkable distance from Lakshman jhula with multiple food options nearby to the place,Guppiee,/Profile/amit156gupta,,50

haridwar,"Decent hotel, very near to Railway station and famous Dada-boudi's hotel. We were late to reach Haridwar during night and stayed there for a single night, and we got good deal here. Rooms are strictly ok type, with the location being at the heart of the city near Railway station.",srideepg82,/Profile/srideepg82,"Kolkata, India",30
haridwar,"Rooms were OK - not very good, Small rooms & far from Har ki paudi. Only advantage is they are in main market and bang opp railway station.   Close to Birla ghat which is not major tourist attraction. Rooms were not very clean and AC was not working well. TV had problems too  We ordered food which was OK. Service was nice with staff being very courteous   Overall - there are many hotels in the vicinity for cheaper price - can give this a miss",Amar B,/Profile/110amarb,"Princeton, New Jersey",30
