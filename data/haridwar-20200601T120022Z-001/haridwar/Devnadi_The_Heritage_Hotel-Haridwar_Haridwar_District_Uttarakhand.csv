haridwar,We stayed in the Ganga Sagar suite at this beautiful hotel which was formerly owned by Ramanand Sagar ji. It is beautiful and has a beautiful big balcony right on Ganga ji. The hotel is retains the charm of a small haveli and the staff are very nice and warm. A special word of thanks to Durgesh the manager who helped us in many ways including arranging a pooja in the mandir.   The hotel was under renovation and the food menu was restricted especially on the first night. But they stopped the work when we requested. Also loved the Amar Chitra Katha and Chacha Chowdhry comics - perhaps from the owner's childhood days :-)   Our only regret was that we did not have enough time to enjoy the balcony as we were in Haridwar only for 2 nights and spent the time outside.,Akshay K,/Profile/301akshayk,"Ingatestone, United Kingdom",50
haridwar,"We visited Devnadi- the Heritage Hotel in the month of April, 2019. It was a family trip and we were 7 members. We booked the suite and the adjacent room on the 1st floor. As we disembarked from our cars and entered through the antique huge wooden door, an open airy courtyard welcomed us. At once, it felt home! The reception was small and yet the smiles at the front desk were broad. The reception was adjacent to the dinning hall which lead us to the lift and we landed on our 1st floor 'Ganga Sagar' suite. Hotel Devnadi had been summer holiday home to the the Queen of Nepal and later on abode to Bollywood Producer/Director Padma Shri Ramanand Sagar ji. It was the same suite where the Queen and the legendary Producer/Director must have found solace and the peaceful environment is",Leeza78,/Profile/Leeza78,"Noida, India",50
haridwar,"Out of two points out of five, at least one is grudgingly given for the heavenly feeling of being on the banks of mother Ganga. The other is for the ever smiling Employees who, though are challenged most of the times with resources, but spiritedly come forward to soothe your temper down, including even the Chef who inquired about my stay as I was checking out :). Without into much details I've identified areas of concern: 1. The property is under renovation with new additions coming up on the upper floors. There is no warning signage, no coverings provided for the civil works. The moment you pass over the grand wooden threshold with Lord Ganesh blessing you into the front courtyard, the nude civil works catches you unawares. 2. Rooms are unkempt with dirt on sills, unswept",Ajit K S,/Profile/Majhola,,20
haridwar,The hotel has very limited rooms. the only room that is worth all the trouble in staying in the hotel is the suite room. All rooms are overpriced. Food is overpriced and portions are small. No parking space in the hotel. The ghat is not very clean for taking bath. The staff is very limited. A property in such a location can be managed much better!!!,weyeskay w,/Profile/weyeskay,,30
haridwar,Great experience staying in Hotel Devnadi. It is boutique place with less than 10 rooms so they are able to provide good service. The best part of the hotel is its private ghat on banks of the river. The Super Deluxe room was large and comfortable.  Bathrooms were clean with warm water throughout. Food was also nice and enjoyable. Overall brilliant place to stay and would recommend it to anyone planning to be in Haridwar.,SingodiaM,/Profile/SingodiaM,"Mumbai, India",50
haridwar,"A beautiful old haveli converted into a boutique heritage hotel right on the banks of Ganga ji. Managed by the Saigals, this property makes one feel at home with their warm hospitality.  Rooms are well appointed with all modern day amenities and yet retain the old world charm. F&B is good, though the speed of service could be better (particularly for the breakfast).  The highlight of the property is the aviral flow of the mighty and divine Ganga ji with a direct access to the river thru a private ghat. The sound of the incessant flow of the river water, the beautiful sunrise visible form the rooms/private ghat - all make one experience an unusual sense of serenity and inner peace !!

We are regular visitors to Haridwar and have stayed in various other hotels in the past, including the Ganga Lahari and the Haveli Hari Ganga etc. This time, I opted for the visit to Devnadi as it was my wish to stay in a location which we have never stayed at before and experience something different. It was the peak of summer and I made this decision while I was in the UK, and my family in India were very happy and excited about our visit.

haridwar,"Devnadi is an old haveli originally belonging to the great TV writer/producer Shri Ramanand Sagar, and lovingly and carefully restored by a family he entrusted it to. It shows. The original teakwood window/door frames, the ornate chandeliers and sconces, the care with which the main entryway and outer structure have been kept unchanged and undisturbed is indicative of the fact that this is more than just a commercial enterprise. The rooms are high-ceilinged and spacious but those looking for a hotel-like luxury experience will be slightly disappointed. The bathroom is small compared to the size of the room. There is no safe; breakfast and meal options are limited and the property is under renovation to add more rooms and a small cafe on the 3rd floor.

Our rooms were impeccable – perfect balance between old world charm and modern amenities. The view of the Ganga from the balcony is great. Having a cup of tea in the morning and looking at the Ganga was really calming. The private ghat is very convenient too.

They have yoga classes in the morning followed by a beautiful Ganga arati at the small temple by the Ganges.  The hotel is impeccably clean, the service is great and the location is simply the best.

The location was great because it was only a couple short blocks from the train station and numerous eating places. The train station was a great place to get a short and inexpensive tuktuk or rickshaw ride to the Aarti ceremony on the Ganges. When we were there, the hotel had a problem with their credit card machine and we were short of Indian currency, but the owner personally took us to another of his businesses so we could pay with our credit card.

We booked 3 nights at Devnadi from 24-27th May, and reached the hotel around 5 in the evening, tired and exhausted after a 7 hour drive; and that is where the amazing hospitality came into play, the check in process was the fast and hassle free, and the owners met us and offered us the suite for a night (as it was free), which we happily took up.  The suite is big, very elegantly designed, and comes with a huge private balcony overlooking the Ganges.

We could hardly get the availability due to rush season of summer vacations, weddings and a Yog Shiver arranged by Patanjali for 3500 people.

This Heritage property is so divine and peaceful that it not only calms you down but also makes you feel heavenly. I bet there is no other place in Haridwar which is even comparable to Devnadi.   The highlight of the place for me was the private ghat. One can just sit by the Ganges for hours and there will be no one to disturb. You can have your cup of tea or even meals laid there by the staff and enjoy with the serenity around. The hospitality offered is commendable.   The hotel is spic-and-span and gives you the experience of a 5-Star property. I can comfortable say that it was one of my best trips and I will recommend Devnadi to everyone visiting Haridwar.

The rooms with balconies and the main suite are tasteful and modern with unique blend of traditional design and modern fixtures. Car parking is nearby. It us roughly 100 rupees tuk tuk ride to Har ki Pauri,  which is fun but jarring to the body. The sunrise on the Ganges is magical.
