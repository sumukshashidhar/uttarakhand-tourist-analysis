haridwar,The hotel management is not at all co-operative. They just charged a huge amount for staying. There is no facility like other hotels. Rooms are not at all good. I am staying with my family for one night with an extremely bitter experience. ACs are not properly working in rooms.,DrManojMajumder,/Profile/DrManojMajumder,,10
