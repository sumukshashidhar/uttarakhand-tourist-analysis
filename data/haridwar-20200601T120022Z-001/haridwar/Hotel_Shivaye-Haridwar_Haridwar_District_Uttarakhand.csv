haridwar,"Not sure if the Boutique tag can be given but a quaint place to stay away from the madding crowdy place like around Har-ki-Pauri and Vishnu Ghat. We booked Premium Triple room. They have 1 Premium Triple room in every floor. Good and Clean room with moderate decor.Ambiance/Lighting is soothing.Washroom had Geyser and Toiletries provided. Room had Tea maker but no sachet of Tea/Coffee provided.  If your main attraction is Har-ki-Pauri, then this hotel is at some distance though rooms are available at very cheaper price compared to those around Har-ki-Pauri. You need to take E-ricksaw's everytime you intend to go/come from H-k-P which costs around Rs50/60 for the whole ricksaw.No Sharing option available. Nearest good & cheaper Luch/Dinner restaurants(Bengali Food joints) are",Sabyasachi,/Profile/Sabyasachi1103,"Kolkata, India",40
haridwar,"The actual room was clean.  However, most of the amenities we're not there. No free breakfast No kettle or coffee maker 1 towel for 2 people. - none of these were a major issue   It says the rooms are sound proof. THEY ARE NOT. Unfortunately the guy behind the desk enjoyed violent TV shows on full volume throughout the day and night. And then to hold loud conversations outside the hotel windows at midnight laughing as his mate revved his engine over and over again. They were still doing so around 1am. We did ask for him to turn his TV down, and he did so for an hour or so but then it went back up. The rooms are stone/marble with no sound absorption. Neither of us got much sleep either night.   Unfortunately as they have smoking rooms the smoke from the upstairs room comes",Lucy,/Profile/223lucyn,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",10

haridwar,Beautiful hotel with many amenities. Staff was helpful and very accommodating. As we were visiting from America so my expectation to find a good hotel in Haridwar was really low but this hotel surprised us and surpassed our expectations. Big rooms with comfortable beds and clean bathrooms made it worth for us. We had a pleasant experience. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Haridwar.,Gaurav,/Profile/GauravKalra325,"Livermore, California",50
haridwar,"We absolutely loved this hotel. It is so impeccably furnished, room are spacious and comfortable. Bathroom is spacious and clean too. Staff is polite and helpful. It is minutes away from Har Ki Pauri, so we were able to attend Aarti everyday. Haridwar is a crowded place usually it is difficult to find parking but there is safe parking near the hotel, so were able to park our car too.",RashiGulati,/Profile/RashiGulati,"San Francisco, California",50
