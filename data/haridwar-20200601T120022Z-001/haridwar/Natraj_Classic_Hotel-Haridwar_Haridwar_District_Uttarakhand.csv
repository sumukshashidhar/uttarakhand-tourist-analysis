haridwar,"This was the most pathetic hotel I have ever stayed. My travel agent recommended this hotel to me as this was close to the railways station and I was her only for a very short time. I had to spend a night as I had no option as my agent had already took advance for 1 night. Reception guy was very shabby, room was dirty and toilet was really awful. I   asked them to give refund after deducting cancellation fee but they declined.",malhotra99,/Profile/malhotra99,"Mumbai, India",20
