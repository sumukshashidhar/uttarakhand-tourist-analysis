haridwar,Worth visiting  and  see Ganga Aarathy in Haridwar. Beautiful water to take bath and worth shopping . Going round in the evening is worth and shopping is cheap . Good temples to visit and best time to visit the Ganga is in the evening to watch Aarathy.,Viswanathan K,/Profile/857viswanathank,"Mumbai, India",50
haridwar,I just spent one night in this hotel. The room was quite big and nice with a balcony but the cleaning standards are the indians one. I am a low budget traveller able to adapt and I find the price/quality ratio good.  The staff was really helpful and friendly,Silvia D,/Profile/bibetta,"Milan, Italy",30
haridwar,Dont stay here! The rooms are full of bed bugs. We stayed here for 4 nights and the last night we discovered at least 10 bugs in the bed. The stuff were not suprised and all we got in return was a new room... Not recommended!,idapidaaaa,/Profile/idapidaaaa,"Oslo, Norway",10
haridwar,"We chose it because we arrived late at night loaded with backpacks (found it on Lonely Planet guide). The hotel was close to the railway station, but off the main road so not too noisy. Lot's of restaurants and shops around.  We've seen several rooms, lots of them had the shower or the toilet broken, but everything quite clean. Finally got one with everything working, but the water was dripping which might be a bit annoying.  We stayed there for 3 nights and got transferred to a better room with a balcony on the last night (we didn't request it, so it was a nice gesture of the owner/manager). Toilet, shower, fan, everything working perfectly. The staff was very friendly and helpful. All the rooms had TVs with lots of channels, although we're usually don't watch TV it was quite",Hello_from_the_Moon,/Profile/Hello_from_the_Moon,Madrid,30
haridwar,"we enjoyed our visit to swagat palace. room service was good, they served hot water very well.every worker was very polite, that was very satisfying. I and my wife decided to be there in the month of june.",brijeshpant_zenith,/Profile/brijeshpant_zenith,"Haldwani, India",40
haridwar,"We did not have any option, as all hotels were full and we were left with no choice. There were cobwebs in the bathroom...nobody came to clean the bathrooms...they were full of cockroaches and earthworms...no geyser facility...only half buckets of hot waters were given. Don't stay in this hotel. ",krr24,/Profile/krr24,,10
haridwar,"I walked in because of lonely planet recommendation. But never stairs there. Creepy old dark and run down room. Shower was not working, only bucket option is available and hot water is occasionally. The manager is unfriendly and is constantly shouting on his staff. I walked out 20 min after I walked in and took a room next by which was much better.",Shukile,/Profile/Shukile,"Tel Aviv, Israel",10
