haridwar,"Mansa devi temple situated on top of Bilwa parvat in the city of Ganga Haridwar. The Siddh peenth is known to full full our desires. The best way to reach temple is Udan Khatola service, walk to a hill for about a hour is also a option, but if you wish to use Udan Khatola you must reach ticket window early in the morning as the sun rises it will be difficult to tolerate the rush. Purchase a combo ticket Mansa Devi and Chandni Devi which will allow you to board trolly by avoiding long queues. The temple Management need to do some work for the safety of pilgrims. I did not find even average security in the temple, Possible stampede will cause a huge loss in peak seasons. Be careful if you are traveling with kids.",Amit p,/Profile/X7175TVamitp,"Ghaziabad, India",30
