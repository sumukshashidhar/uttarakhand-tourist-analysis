haridwar,It's a good budget hotel. I stayed here along with my family. Over all it was a good experience although female staff like receptionist and service boy are not so much co operative. They need to be trained how to deal with guests.,gaurav850,/Profile/gaurav850,"Karnal, India",40
haridwar,Very nice hotel for stay.. staff was good. Worth it.. everything was good Nice location and you can easily reach to the hotel it is about 2kilometer from the haridwar railway station. Ganga ghat is also near to hotel,Rohit A,/Profile/RohitA1166,,50
haridwar,I had a booking confirmed and called the 24/24h reception in the day to tell them that I was arriving in the night. Ten minutes before I arrived they just cancelled my reservation and don't answer the phone even if I called 15 times. They are the WORST,Tanguy S,/Profile/TanguyS47,,10
