haridwar,"I may have different point of comparison with local travelers, but I wasn't feeling that comfortable in this hotel. Some of the staff try to be nice, some don't give a damn. Noise from the street or the hotel is barely attenuated by the door and the ""inside"" windows, making you feel you are in the corridor, but without the air flow as the bathroom (somehow clean) is stuck in a corner without a chance to ever dry. Moreover, the location might be ""in the city"" it's still far from touristic area or my conference location, involving long trip in rickshaw too happy to announce over-rated prices.",Wandering_Racoon,/Profile/Wandering_Racoon,"Prague, Czech Republic",20
haridwar,The Hotel is a budget one and pretty good for staying for a night or two. Rooms are spacious and although the amenities are ok but could have been made a little modern and bathroom amenities also need improvement. Restaurant is average.,N N Mit,/Profile/nnmit,"New Delhi, India",40
haridwar,"The staff here especially the receptionist is so rude that the first gesture is non welcoming. There were discrepancies in the bill which the staff wasn't ready to accept.The service is worst and it spoiled the experience of my whole trip. Will never ever come back here, nor will recommend it to anyone. Please dont visit here!!",AsthaSakshi,/Profile/AsthaSakshi,,10
haridwar,"Yes, I am very right for this remark for this hotel as i am a frequent Business Traveler to Haridwar and staying in this hotel since 2009. If you want a good hotel in your budget limit starts from Rs.1100/- to Rs.2000/- per day then this hotel is best suited for every one. It is situated in the heart of the city. Their service is very fast, with pleasant personality whether it related to food, beverages or room services.All i can say very good. The quality of food served here is very good of taste and value for money.The hotel Manager is very cooperative. What ever you come business visit or for holiday making all i can say it very good.. All rooms were well appointed the preferable should be the deluxe one.",bubu32,/Profile/bubu32,"Faridabad, India",40
haridwar,It's a good hotel once you enter but after checking in it proves to be a typically a local hotel with poor service and bad quality food.we gave order for food with some guidance but it went in vein n food was pathetic to eat . complaining to reception is of no use as they will backfire. ...so take Ur caĺl,Nitin2226,/Profile/Nitin2226,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",10
haridwar,"We stayed at this hotel for a night when we were enroute Rishikesh. We were looking for a budget accommodation and this hotel fit our requirements well.  We took the deluxe room. Everything was fine in general. One solo window, of course, didn't provide much ventilation. The room décor needs a little more planning in terms of curtain colours, etc. But the room was clean, toilets were quite usable. Everything worked with no faults.  What I liked is the service and the food. The housekeeping folks came on time when called. Room service was prompt, in fact, fast. When I ordered a veg platter, the person taking the order apologised that it will take some time as platter needs preparation. When I asked how much, he said 15-20 min. I exclaimed, that much time I expect any food to cook",Sanjay C,/Profile/sanjaychak,"Ghaziabad, India",30
