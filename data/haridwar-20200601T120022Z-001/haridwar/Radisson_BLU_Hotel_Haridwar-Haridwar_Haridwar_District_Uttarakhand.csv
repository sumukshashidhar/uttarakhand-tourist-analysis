Check in and check out was smooth. Every instruction or hotel policy is clearly mentioned every where and still you don't feel offended by any of this.   The rooms are spacious and super clean so is the bathroom. The bathroom comes with bathtub and all the required toiletries. Wardrobe has iron (which was not working in our case), ironing table, safe, bathrobe, room slippers etc. Free wifi is provided. Room service and the taste of food was good.

Around 12-15 km and outside from main tourist spots of Haridwar... In a remote industrial location (Far from city) 2. Even after booking for 3 Adults, they did not have extra bed and only gave regular sponge mattress which was almost like sleeping on the floor. 3. Washroom was not that clean as expected from a hotel of this rating.  Pros: 1. Near a movie and shopping mall 2.

And always have surpassed expectations ... I never wrote a review though I stayed here for atleast 10 or more times earlier  . But now I feel they deserve a review ....I remember the time long ago around 4 years back or more maybe the hotel was new and I during my lunch just mentioned the non veg was not so good and won't be there in the evening as I would go out ...

There was a huge rush on the day of our visit from weekenders from the NCR, finding a table during breakfast was a task in itself during our entire stay!! Food was OK, there is very limited option of non-veg food (understandably so, this is a hindu pilgrimage). Rooms are nice, we had a faulty lock and the help desk couldn't really do anything to sort it out. Had to be escorted everytime by the attendant to open the room.  There is a mall right next door, where you can buy things(in case you missed out something at home). There is also a restaurant close by in case you want to have a change of food.

haridwar,Located inside an industrial park and adjoins a mall. Nowhere close to the Ganges but if like me you need a reasonably comfortable place to stay and have no available options it does the job. Rooms are pretty big and the all-day dining restaurant is decent without being exceptional. The advantage is that you can get a drink and non-vegetarian food here unlike inside Haridwar which is dry and meatless. But the hotel lacks the professionalism you'd expect from a Radisson chain hotel. We had an issue with our bathroom which they simply could not resolve for the entire length of our stay. Front office staff are overworked and clueless. Restaurant and room-service staff on the other hand are warm and eager to please.,SanjoyM68,/Profile/SanjoyM68,"New Delhi, India",30

First it's located in SIDCUL which is an industrial area 4 to 5 kms away from main city. So you need to have your own vehicle.

The hotel is about 10 km from Har ki Pauri and takes around 20 min to reach by cab. The railway station is also about the same distance from the hotel. To those considering Country Inn or Godwin or Royal Orchid I would say their location is no better than Radisson as they are located outside the main city on Haridwar - Rishikesh highway.

It is really annoying to go for a bath and find no hot water and when you complain someone will switch it on from somewhere and you will be made to look like a fool. When I complained at the reception, they sent a junior level person to talk to me telling that she was the manager incharge whereas I could see the staff in suits (black and gray) having their breakfast at the buffet. Do not expect service as the waiters will be busy serving the managers and staff in suits. Lack of training is",Travel_Grande,/Profile/Travel_Grande,India,20
haridwar,"nice rooms, nice staff, but parts of hotel are still under construction some services are not up to the mark like the pool changing rooms and the gym, small finishing defects in almost all rooms like flush not effective temperature controls of ac not working and very poor lighting in all rooms.",akshatbass,/Profile/akshatbass,"Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, India",30
haridwar,"The hotel is supposed to be a part of a very prestigious chain. I wonder if this place would actually live up to the expectations of any from a Radisson. We have just checked in about 3 hrs ago and i have enough to write (not good at all!!) about the hotel for more than 2 pages.  1) The front desk are courteous but not trained to handle clientele.   2) The rooms are below par. Checked into a standard room, and found it not too appealing (probably because we were coming off a stay in Grand Hyatt - Goa). Some of the reasons are""  a) The work desk is placed in the way rather than to a corner and it is fixed so cannot be moved. b) The plug points are not ergonomic at all. And most are either at the work desk or near the coffee maker. They should be closer to the bed for easy acess.",Jayanth1612,/Profile/Jayanth1612,"Hyderabad, India",20
haridwar,"Didnt stay but attended a seminar hosted by one of Radissons bigger clients. Banquet area service very poor, staff poorly trained.  The toilets were leaking, wet and smelly. overall a poor experience. Complaints addressed to Sanjay Rathore, GM, did not elecit a response. Not sure if the front desk even told him.  The banquet lobby air-conditioning didnt work, the service there was bad. Lackadaisical response to every complaint.  Dont use it!",VIkramPuri,/Profile/VIkramPuri,Pune,20
haridwar,"A very nice and neat NEW hotel in haridwar. Good food in the restaurant. and not toooo many options for Breakfast, but whatever was there is good. The room amenties are up to any Radission BLU mark and are great.  Didnt have hot water in the room The AC suddenly stopped at night Took 45 mins to go thru the billing procedure The staff doesnt respond adequately to your responses. Most important - All the Fire Exits are Locked and chained,,, in case there is a FIRE...BEST OF LUCK!!!! Spoke to the GM of the property and he has assured to IMPROVE services. Lets see.....  Not fully funtional hotel so couuld still give it the benefit of doubt",VSHAH-DXB,/Profile/VSHAH-DXB,"Jebel Ali, United Arab Emirates",30

haridwar,"We chose this hotel because of the 'Radisson' tag... and we were not disappointed. One of the premium hotels in Haridwar, and just located next to the holy river Ganga. The only negative point in this place is that it was extremely crowded when we were checking in. We had to wait for about 45 minutes before a room could be allocated.",Sharad B,/Profile/sharadb854,India,40
