haridwar,"We stayed two nights. We stayed here several years ago, enjoyed it then, and enjoyed our stay again this time. Our room was comfortable with an outlook over the open courtyard. The design of the building contributes to the relaxing feeling of the place. The hotel is a short walk from the river a short ride to the railway station. The back route along the river and through the bazaars leads to the clock tower in only fifteen to twenty minutes and provides an enjoyable walking alternative to the Main Street. The management was very welcoming, friendly and professional.  We would stay again.",geesee,/Profile/geesee,Australia,30
haridwar,"We arrived at 06:00 AM because of a night train. Apparently we had to check out on 06:00 the next day, because of their 24 hours policy. At the reception there is big sign that says ""check out at 12:00"" and no one told us about this 24 hours thing. It seemed that this was written in the guest book, but we didnt see it and the guy failed to tell us. They expected us to pay for a whole new day and we thought this was absurd. It felt like a set up to get more money from us. Luckily we got away by paying half a day.",La R,/Profile/lar155,,10
haridwar,"It is located very near Gujranwala Bhawan on Niranjan Akhara Rd., about 700-800 m. from the Rly. Stn. Its advantage is it is less noisy/congested than the Jassa Ram Road area plus it has its own compound and mini-garden- a slight touch of greenery is always better in crowded areas. I took their standard room as I was to leave at 6 a.m. next day. The room and bathroom were okayish, could have been maintained better as the cleaning was not proper, there was dust plus the A/c in the balcony (I had gone for the NAC option) had lot of bird-droppings and the balcony in particular was not very clean. However it is near to all the restaurants/shops, etc. and is not a bad option for 1-2 days. I have not seen the deluxe rooms which may be better.",Kashmalan Doctor,/Profile/kashmaland,"Baroda, India",30
haridwar,"We stayed three days.  From the time we arrived at reception we were made to feel welcome.  It was right at the culmination of yatra, rooms in town fully booked and the intensity of people movement and sounds was full-on, passing right in front of the hotel entrance on the way to the river.  The Inder Kutir provided a calm place to stay, mainly due to their steady and professional approach, customer service, and the open terrace layout of the hotel.  Our room was modest but adequate consistent with the tariff, and we were provided with a choice to move to access hot water. The manager was attentive from the time of reservation, on arrival at check-in, helping with requests, and at departure, and set the scene for a comfortable stay. Well located for the river, train station and",geesee,/Profile/geesee,Australia,30
