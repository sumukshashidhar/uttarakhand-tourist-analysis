haridwar,"Otherwise nice place to stay in between Haridwar and Rishikesh it is very prominently located at Raiwala. But the hotel / resort is just not well maintained, apart from the good quality of food available there is nothing which can be talked about this place.",ANUJ,/Profile/anujchopraji,"New Delhi, India",30
haridwar,"I visit in this hotel last week, Its not resort , Its Bugged house, . Lots of bugs in the room, There were no glass in the windows, No proper electricity, Broken Almirah.    Poor food service, no phone in room ( We need to shout in the garden to order the food ), They charge us 3500 rs per room which is really not worth it .   I seriously had a very bad experience in this hotel, OHH GOD.. I dont want have bad words for bad reviews.  Please everyone read this and do not visit this hotel Ever,,,,,",Kashish007111,/Profile/Kashish007111,"New Delhi, India",10
