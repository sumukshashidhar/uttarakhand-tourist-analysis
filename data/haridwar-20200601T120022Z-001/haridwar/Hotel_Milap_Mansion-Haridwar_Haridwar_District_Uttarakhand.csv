haridwar,"Clean ac room( though a bit small in size and few room furniture), round the clock hot water in washroom and very accessible location (located on motor drivable road and very close to Haridwar railway station near Chitra cinema hall) would summarise my stay here.Our room was in the first floor hence can't confirm the presence of elevator.",Sagnik Banerjee,/Profile/Sagnik94,"Kolkata, India",30

haridwar,"My wife and I had booked a night at this hotel with booking.com. After we arrived at 9:30 we patiently waited for one of the three staff members behind the counter to help us but all of them ignored us until we finally spoke up and said we had a booking. Immediately they started arguing back and forth and yelling then finally said that yes that had rooms but would not give us one because they were only for Indians. Even after I showed my confirmed booking they still said ""Indians only"" and forced us out at 10pm without a place to stay and in city we had never been too. I would have understood if it was a simple mistake but they actually told us they had rooms available but simply wouldn't give us one based solely on the fact we weren't Indian.

haridwar,We visited during ardhkumbh with wife and kid. We want to a budget hotel for night stay only. Its a relatively clean small sized room with relatively clean bathroom. I can recommend it for short overnight budget stay. Food was good. Value for money family budget hotel.,komalankur,/Profile/komalankur,"Noida, India",30
