haridwar,"On April 27,2015 on our way from Corbett to Mussourie,we stopped at Haridwar for Ganga arti and darshan at the temples.There are many hotels in the Bhupatwala Shani Mandir area along the highway to Dehradun.We walked into Hotel Krishna Heritage because it seemed the best hotel in the area and very close to Hari ki paudi and the temples.Inside this is a new,neat and tidy hotel.We stayed in the familly room which has two large comfortable double beds,sofa,TV,fridge,AC.The bathroom was clean and modern.The linen in the room was fresh.There is no restaurant but a prompt and adequate room service.The room and food rates are reasonable.Most of all the staff is very friendly,coperative and eager to please.We had a good experience at this hotel and can recommend it to travellers who",884pradyumna,/Profile/884pradyumna,"Mumbai, India",40
