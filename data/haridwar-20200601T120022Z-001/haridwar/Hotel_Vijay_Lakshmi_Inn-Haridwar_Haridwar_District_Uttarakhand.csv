haridwar,I travelled with family and had one of the worst experiences with this hotel. I would highly recommend against booking this hotel to anyone. very non-professional staff and the hotel lobby and rooms are stinking like anything. We lost some money from the room and upon enquiring at reception we got the reply that they are not responsible for any belongings inside the room. There is also no presence of any CCTV camera in the lobby. So if you do make your booking in this hotel kindly carry all your stuff along with you whenever you leave the room or else dont book the hotel. Really horrific experience and this hotel spoiled our trip.,Ashish K,/Profile/ashishk123456789,,10
haridwar,"The room we were allotted had a very dingy feel. The walls had seepage and the electricity was out during most of our 'little' time at the hotel. Except for the receptionist, the staff felt threatening in their demeanour. Was quite an experience staying here for 2 days. The only good part was that the food tasted fine but took quite some time to be ready.",TwoKPandey,/Profile/TwoKPandey,"New Delhi, India",20
