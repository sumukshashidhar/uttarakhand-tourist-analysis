haridwar,"We had a booking at Pandit Narayan hostel for 5 on 22nd. However, some mistakes from the management led to confusion and ultimately cancellation of our alloted room. But however, when we reached the hostel, they managed to give us one room for 5 people. When we saw the room, it was quite big and easily adjustable for 5 people. So we went ahead and stayed there.  The place is quite good and safe. It is located at an approx 10-15 mins of ride from the railway station at nearly 3km. It is easier to find autos for travelling to any place.  The room was big, had air conditioning and the washrooms and bedsheets were also clean. Our room had geyser for hot water.  The staff at the reception was also very helpful. They have RO for drinking water.  Overall a nice place, if you are",Santoshjnair,/Profile/Santoshjnair,"Ahmedabad, India",30
