haridwar,"I stayed here with my family. I booked non-AC room in this hotel. The room was spacious and clean. The interior of the bathroom was especially nice. There are many eateries near to this hotel. We preferred to eat outside rather than in the hotel.So, i can't comment on food served here. Overall, our stay was comfortable.",Niya1315,/Profile/Niya1315,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
