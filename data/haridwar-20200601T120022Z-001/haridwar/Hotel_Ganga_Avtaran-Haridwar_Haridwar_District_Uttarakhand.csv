haridwar,"We reached Haridwar at 2 A.M by car, worried about hotel. We found 2-3 guys on bike asking people for accomodation etc. We asked them about a good hotel near holly river ganga then they took us to this hotel, hotel is nice, staff is also nice, rooms are big and clean, reasonable price per room, the only dis-advantage is its near about 1 k.m away from ""Har ki pedi"". But it doesn't mean that hotel is situated far from market, there are shops and good market near hotel but you have to walk 15 to 20 minutes to reach at main attraction of haridwar. we paid 500 rupees non a/c room for 3 people.",qwertygaurav,/Profile/qwertygaurav,amritsar,30
