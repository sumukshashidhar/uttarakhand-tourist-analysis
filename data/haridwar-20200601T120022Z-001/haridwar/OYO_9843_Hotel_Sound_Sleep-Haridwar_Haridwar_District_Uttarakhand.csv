haridwar,"We stayed here in June 2019. No electricity backup, rude staff. dirty rooms all the qualities of a bad hotel to stay, one should stay away from them. Staff is not at all helpful, but i very rude. Not recommended for decent people. The hotel staff is bunch of crooks,",Shweta,/Profile/Shweta188218,,10
haridwar,"It was very worst experience for me and my family to stay at oyo 9843 sound sleep,Haridwar.I came to this hotel on 28th June 2018,I booked this hotel by giving 1000+Paytm charge,The room also includes AC.But it was around 3hours power cut in night and even fan was not working.Atleast they have to provide an inverter connection to Fan in their hotel. There were many mosquitos in the room when there was power cut. In Morning we ordered parathas with curd in breakfast but they didn't gave curd and charged for full.they even didn't provide us tissue paper,and told tissue paper is out of stock. Very cheap hotel and worst experience with this hotel.  Suggestion to Hotel owner,Atleast make an arrangement for inverter Connection in Fan if you can't afford the Generator.",vijaysaini2009,/Profile/vijaysaini2009,"New Delhi, India",10

haridwar,"Удобно расположен, вдали от шума города, но трасса, где всегда можно поймать рикшу, в пяти минутах ходьбы. Вежливый и обходительный персонал, правда по-английски мало кто говорит. Меню отеля очень дешевое, и довольно разнообразное. Если хочется чего-то побогаче, то через дорогу, недалеко, есть более серьезный ресторан. Номер был не очень, но это для Индии обычное дело. Много муравьев и мошкары, два или три геккона также жили со мной в номере.",mindrot,/Profile/mindrot,"Moscow, Russia",30
