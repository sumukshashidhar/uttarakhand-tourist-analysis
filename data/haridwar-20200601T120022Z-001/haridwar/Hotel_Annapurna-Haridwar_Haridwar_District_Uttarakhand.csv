haridwar,We have gone to haridwar on October 2012. The hotel was not clean at all. Their were poisonous insects. The food quality was bad. Food was not given on time. deluxe room was just a small room. Bathroom pipes had leeks. Their was a bad odour. Staffs were behaving like un-cultured people.  I dont recommend anybody to come here.,skcy2001,/Profile/skcy2001,"Kolkata, India",10
