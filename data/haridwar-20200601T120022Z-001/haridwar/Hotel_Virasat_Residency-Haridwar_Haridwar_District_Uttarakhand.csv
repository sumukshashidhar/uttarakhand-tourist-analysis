haridwar,the rooms are very small and expensive. Also every night there is loud sound of the generator and it disturbs the sleep. Good quality rooms are available in the adjacent hotel at a lower rate. The staff is very adamant. The food also seems not good in this hotel.,neerajiflex,/Profile/neerajiflex,"Mumbai, India",10
