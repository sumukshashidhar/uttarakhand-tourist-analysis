haridwar,"We were coming around and we stopped here due to cold night and cold.We see many hotels but in the end we have seen this hotel At first we felt it safe place because in the reception all senior citizen person are working. We got a good room for good money. The best part of hotel is there service to them is that you can do anything you want to get in a very short time. Whatever we requested, it was given in a very short time and well Just pay attention to the repair and cleaning of the hotel If the hotel focuses on cleaning, then this is a great hotel.But I will advise everyone that whenever you go to Haridwar, here you must stay.. thanks to all",Jackline2023,/Profile/Jackline2023,"Indianapolis, Indiana",50
haridwar,"We were a group and had booked 4 rooms for our stay thru Cleartrip from 3rd and 6th to 8th Oct 2017. Very dirty place. Bed linen seem unwashed since ages, bath rooms stink, towel rods in bath rooms are precariously hanging in one screw (room No. 212), bath room lights as well as room lights are dysfunctional, ceiling fan regulators are dysfunctional... I can go on and on.  You should look at the sofas in the entrance. They are extremely grimy and smelly. Wi-fi does not reach the rooms. Only in the lobby you have wi-fi of very poor signal strength.  I would sincerely advise any one who sees this review to keep away. Travel sites like Cleartrip, Goibibo should remove this hotel from their sites.",H M,/Profile/276hm,,10

haridwar,"Hotel rooms are good,clean and spacious.It is in a prime location close to highway . staff is very polite in the hotel. Front office staff was very caring about my comfort. The other staff was friendly and caring too.I found the service extremely good. Food was perfectly acceptable.  I suggest every traveler to chose this hotel as a destination where you can stay for sure with good experience.  Hot water was not available 24 hrs and that was the only complaint I had to make during my short stay.

haridwar,"Based on the reviews I read of this place, I was expecting a distinctly average service. However, from that starting point, I was pleasantly surprised.  It is certainly not a luxury hotel, but rooms were clean and tidy, the food was perfectly acceptable and I found the service extremely friendly.  I surprise myself a little by saying this, but I would go back.",TL Traveller,/Profile/tltraveller78,"Sliema, Malta",40

haridwar,Rooms were ok but spacious. Service was slow & poor. Location is good. Food was ok. Hot water was not available 24 hrs and that made the situation more difficult.,bhavin1_2,/Profile/bhavin1_2,"Vadodara, India",20
haridwar,"We chose this hotel primarily to spend the night somewhere other than the car; before heading out to Rishikesh. And it served the purpose. Just about. Though all we wanted was to sleep, the quality of linen in the rooms was very poor. The pillows did not have covers and the pillows and the bed sheets had stains. One gets a sense of general disinterest for upkeep of rooms, a chair in the rooms was broken and the rooms was not as clean as expected. The loo however was thankfully clean.   Room service was prompt in the morning even though the front desk was busy with a lot of check outs. Parking facility was provided without any additional cost, though it was insufficient given the fact that the hotel was full. I was woken up at 830 in the morning and requested to move my car even",alexander5upertramp,/Profile/alexander5upertramp,"New Delhi, India",30
