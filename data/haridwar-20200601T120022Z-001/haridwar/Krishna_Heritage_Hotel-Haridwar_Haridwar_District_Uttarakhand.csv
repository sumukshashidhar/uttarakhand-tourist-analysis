haridwar,Had been there to meet our Swami Ji but found the hotel was very simple and very small rroms. Air conditioner was also window type old fashioned one.  Comparing to that hotel many good Ashrams are better than this. Service was also not good. Not worth visiting.,Satish J,/Profile/satishj555,"Amman, Jordan",10
haridwar,"Seeing previous review, We had booked 3 rooms in this Hotel. But our experience was horrible. The rooms were very small and conjusted. When we reached, it was observed that the telephone of the rooms were not working. Somehow they have made it alright. In the morning when we were ready to take bath, it was found that Geasure was not working. After lodging complaint, they have opened a separate room and told us to take our bath there. When we told the manager to change the room, he flatly refused though there was vacant rooms available. Room was having TV but most of the time cable signal was not working. Hotel management claimed that wifi is available in Hotel but that also was not working.               ",Vinaya Prakash S,/Profile/vinayaprakashs,Mumbai,10

haridwar,"Just back from a family trip at Haridwar, I stayed with my family of 4 in 2 rooms from the hotel. The location is pretty good considering it is on the main delhi-rishikesh Highway. Har-ki-Pauri is about 3 Kms and Chandi Devi temple is approx 7 Kms from the hotel.  With autos easily available just outside.. the location is nice ... well connected with the major places but nicely away from the extreme crowd that gathers up in haridwar [esp. on weekends]  The parking area is also sufficient, During most of our stay there the hotel was more or less completely occupied..But parking was never an issue.  The rooms are clean and nicely maintained with the LCDs and AC working upto req (with a horrible 45 degrees outside) We opted for 2 Standard rooms. Except for the fact that one was a",Wolverine S,/Profile/WolverineS539,New Delhi,40
