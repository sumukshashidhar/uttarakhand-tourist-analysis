haridwar,I've stayed one night it is a average hotel to stay food quality is good staff is  caring overall recommended for single family stay will face problem as the main city is very far if you have your own conveyance than it is ok otherwise no public conveyance after 8 pm ,Mohit T,/Profile/MohitT332,,30

haridwar,"Worst experience ever  Hotel location is far away from main Highway or the main har ki Pauri ghat  Food quality was horrible,  rude staff.    There was a party in their bouquet hall,  the music was on till mid night,  no staff was available for the rooms   We called room service more than 20 times just to get a spoon.    AC in the room was not working,  but hotel staff was unaware of it.   In the morning, around 7 am,  someone knocked the door,  some people from wedding party last night,  wanted to see our room,  ARE U SERIOUS??????  :-/  when we called the reception for the same,  the person said we don't know if some random person is there in side the hotel.    Horrible stay at Hotel Flora  Don't recommend it at any cost ",Escape590914,/Profile/Escape590914,,10
haridwar,I stayed there almost for 20-25 days ! Staff was really very good ! Rooms were spacious and well furnished ! House keeping staff always did good job ! Food was also good ! But my suggestion is they should increase the South Indian dishes ! Over all it was a good experience !,Lazygeet,/Profile/Lazygeet,"New Delhi, India",40
haridwar,"Bang on main road to BHEL Complex. Ample parking (though open). Once in, met with a courteous smile. Rooms shown without expecting booking. Neat clean rooms having appropriate large size with wooden flooring, LCD a working table and moving about space. Neat clean linen and an immaculate toilet.   Room service was perfect and food most delicious. Though, their Menu is Veg., they arranged non-veg from outside. The room service kitchen works till 10 pm.",SanjeevNirwani,/Profile/SanjeevNirwani,"New Delhi, India",50
