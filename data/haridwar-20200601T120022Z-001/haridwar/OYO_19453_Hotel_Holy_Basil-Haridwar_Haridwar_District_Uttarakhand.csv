haridwar,Bad service experience. Booked online .. but found they don't have any tie up  Ordered food . But not delivered on time.. also half the order served.  Morning was more horrible. Hot water served in bucket ... Won't recommend at all,Lakshya,/Profile/Lucky1809,,10
haridwar,Chose this hotel after high recommendation from OYO team in Jaipur especially Abhijat . It was well communicated that rooms would be available to our group by 10.00 am.  When we reached it was a different picture as shown in OYO website/app and hotel website.  Pictures would say it all.  Thanks to Mr Malik for hosting our group without a sense of professionalism.  Owner - I think he is least interested in seeing customer satisfaction.,royalescape,/Profile/royalescape,"Jaipur, India",10
haridwar,"Used washroom with full of potty in washroom, not even flushed forget cleaned. Dirty bedsheets and pillow covers. Dustbin full of garbage. Walls all decorated with some stuff. Non cooperative hotel staff.  I checked out in less than 30 min from the hotel claiming my full refund from makemytrip. Never ever opt for this hotel. Check pictures yourself.",Nikky,/Profile/Sanakausar,,10
