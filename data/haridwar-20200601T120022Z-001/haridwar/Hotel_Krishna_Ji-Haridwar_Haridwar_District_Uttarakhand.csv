Even in the high summer( 40 degree plus celsius) rooms well very cool and calm. Although this is a very well built property with all modern facility but for my surprise I came to know from the owner that this building was 90 years old (1930's) and he got this refurbished that took him more time than for getting a new building constructed. Really very impressed with the idea and this culture has helped to build the system and processes more custumer centric.  I also tried lunch at the roof top - very fresh and tasty. Room service was quick. Overall very satisfied.",Vikashkalp,/Profile/Vikashkalp,"New Delhi, India",50

haridwar,Hotel Krishna was the perfect hotel for our 1 night in Haridwar. Located about 5 mins drive from the train station.  One thing you notice about this hotel is how clean it is. The owner has obviously made this a priority for his team and it shows. They have used better quality finishing as well and there are no broken fixtures or badly done repairs. Again this speaks about the standards of the owners. We had a family room 2 x king sized beds. LCD TV with loads of English channels . Showers had good pressure and plenty of hot water . There is also AC for the warmer months.  There is a roof top restaurant. The guys are all very friendly and serve up great food.

Then someone advised us to stay in Hotel Krishna (Newly Constructed). It was not near Ganga however very close to railway station. We really liked it as it had everything we wanted with decent room rent. The food quality is very good.

We had asked for a strong tea with less sugar but everytime we received the opposite even after replacement. We subsequently had tea in stalls in the lane which served excellent tea.

The restaurant terrace is also a nice setting in the evenings for a meal and views. Each floor has a lounge area and daily housekeeping is available for those interested.

I stayed for two nights in a room on the third floor, there was music playing in the hallway speakers which could be quite loud in the evenings. Some guests were also using the hallways as a lounge and watching the TV at loud volumes there. The room was a good size, clean with a comfortable bed. However it lacked few homely touches. For example, there was no curtain or blind on the window which meant that the room was very bright in the mornings. There was also no bedside light, only the bright overhead lights. The room wasn't really decorated, just white walls so it felt a little sterile, like a hospital.
