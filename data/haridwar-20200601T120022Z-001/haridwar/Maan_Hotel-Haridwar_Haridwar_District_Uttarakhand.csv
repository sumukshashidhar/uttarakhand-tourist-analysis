haridwar,"The very close location to the station is the only good point about the hotel. As a single female traveler, I felt very unsecure by the non talkactive and staring stuff members and owner of the place. Rooms are like typical Indian style hotel rooms: huge, but sparely equipped and most things you don t want to touch. Fortunately I had a sleeping bag with me, otherwise I would have really be scared to sleep in the bed with stains of red and yellow stuff on it. Maybe it was washed, but it didn t look like it at all. Maybe this hotel is better for families and couples, for single travelers I would not recommend it.",Laura V,/Profile/laurav159,"Munich, Germany",20
