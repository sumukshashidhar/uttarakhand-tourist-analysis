haridwar,"We had gone to this Rest House with high expectations, but were sorely disappointed.  The condition of the Rest House is quite run down.  But the major and terrible nuisance was that there was no running water on that day!  Apparently, water supply in the complete area was affected due to some reason.  Therefore, if you are planning a stay at this Rest House, please make sure about the water situation.",Rakesh M,/Profile/RM72,"Lucknow, India",20
haridwar,The Forest Rest House is beautifully located amidst deep silence.If lucky one can spot elephants and cheetals in the premesis itself in the night. Mr. Thapa is always ready to cook anything for you on being provided the raw material. Mr chauhan the Manager is a very nice person and guides in a very nice manner.The Birlas have their personal property on the bank of The Ganges at a distence of 5 km. though restricted but you may be allowed inside with the help of forest officials. The bath which one takes there  is a rare and royal one.I will advise personally to collect water from that place. The Safari is the best vehiclet o go to that place that is the Ganga Lahari. Vehicle with low ground clearence may not find possible to rech that place.even if taken risk one may leave their,pbhardwajadv,/Profile/pbhardwajadv,gurgaon,50
