haridwar,"Its situated at some couple of kilometres from the Ghat. Quiet area, Free car park, AC room, hot waters, TV with some decent channels And your free breakfast which unfortunately we missed due to the absence of their pantry boys!  The other bad thing we had - It was closed when we came from visiting the Ghats in middle of night. We had to call a couple of times to wake up the guy for the entrance! Its just an OK room to spend a night for a cheap price with the given amenities.",sl0wtripper,/Profile/sl0wtripper,"New Delhi, India",30
