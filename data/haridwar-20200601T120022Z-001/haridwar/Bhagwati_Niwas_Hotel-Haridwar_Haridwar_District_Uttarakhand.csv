haridwar,"The hotel is on the bank of the river. Just wonderful.  Rooms are also moderately good. Food is OK. The view is fantastic , you can enjoy it throughout the 24 hrs. It is a bit of distance from Har Ka Puri. In haridwar the main thing is the Ganga which you can enjoy.",arun509,/Profile/arun509,"Kolkata, India",40
haridwar,"My stay in this hotel during June 2015 was a very pleasant experience. At the bank of river Ganga (at Vishnu Ghat), this hotel is a budget hotel with clean rooms and courteous hotel staff. One can watch flowing Ganga till late night, while sitting on the varandah or balcony of this hotel.  S.R. CHOWDHURY",SRCFILMS,/Profile/SRCFILMS,"New Delhi, India",40
