haridwar,Location is very nice. Rooms were Clean. Nearest from Railway Station & Har ki pauri. I booked this hotel by Choice World Travels.  Choice World Travels suggested me about this hotel So thanku so much Ms. Archana Shukla,Miss Laxmi,/Profile/286misslaxmi,,50
haridwar,Not a place for stay even for animals and is not worth staying a penny. White ants on the roof and staff not even accepting the fault in cleanliness. We took it out of sheer bad luck in midnight. Toilet is like an hell.,Manish G,/Profile/974manishg,,10
haridwar,"The hostel's location is very good if you're looking to see Haridware, though the guy at the reception was not very noce, the owner was VERY nice and welcoming, he was also very helpful in recommending restaurants and helping us getting around  ",Nitsan S,/Profile/395nitsans,"Tel Aviv, Israel",20
haridwar,A quiet nook but sparten really just a bare courtyard.  Average size rooms with electrical issues are dark and just adequately clean. There is no restaurant despite the menus as food is outsourced from the street from what we could tell. Although there are showers they are not hot as we believed we were told and the hotel manager when finally our bucket hot water arrived tried to charge. The plus is its walking distance to everything.,Katherine S,/Profile/509KatherineS,,20
