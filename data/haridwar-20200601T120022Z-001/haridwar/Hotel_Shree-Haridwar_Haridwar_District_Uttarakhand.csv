haridwar,"Worst night ever.  Horrible staff.  The manager turned on the TV very loud at 4 am just next to our room, I had to come and tell him to stop it.  They started yelling at 7 am in the morning. When we told the owner and manager that they wouldn't let us sleep,  he answers that is his room (the one next to ours)  and also ""pay me my cash"".  ridiculous. In one year travelling this has been the worst sleeping night ever and thanks to the staff that don't care at all about their guest. I'm adding a picture of the staff that was there today ",Catalina D,/Profile/349catalinad,,10
