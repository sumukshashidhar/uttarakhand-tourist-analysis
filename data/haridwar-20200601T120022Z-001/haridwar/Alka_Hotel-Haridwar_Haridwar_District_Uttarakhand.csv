haridwar,"I checked into this hotel exhausted from a horrible experience in Rishikesh. Since we had a train from Haridwar the following morning, we decided to stay in Haridwar. Once at the Ghat, we just didn't have enough energy to go to Shiv Murrieta Chowk to book a hotel. So we checked in here. Best decision. The room was comfortable, just about. But the location made up for all flaws. The staff was supportive and friendly. A little more attention to cleanliness would truly make this hotel exceptional.",Suzanna_stephens,/Profile/Suzanna_stephens,"New Delhi, India",40
haridwar,Good hotel. Clean and decent room. We got a room with Ganga view with attached balcony. AC and TV were there. Cheap considering the location - prime location as it is just in front of Har Ki Pauri and near to the market as well. Only issue was the bathroom was not that good.,Atreyee R,/Profile/atreyeer,"Bengaluru, India",40
