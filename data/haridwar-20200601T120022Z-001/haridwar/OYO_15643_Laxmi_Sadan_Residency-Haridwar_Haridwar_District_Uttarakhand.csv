haridwar,"This place has all the qualities of a bad hotel. Dont try, the pics on the web are fake, rude staff, liers and cheaters. Beware of this hotel. Dirty rooms, bathroom cant be even entered. Food was stale when we complaint they shouted and said if you want to have, have it and pay for it. WE were scared of them. Local dada kind of people.",Shweta,/Profile/Shweta188218,,10

haridwar,"We stayed in the hotel during Oct 14-17, 2016 with extended family members (we booked five rooms; room Nos. 211, 212, 213, 214 and 215).  This is one of the worst hotels I have ever come across.  So unfriendly staff no hygiene. So shameless people they can spoil anyone's trip. The staff at the reception does not know ABCD of Hospitality Industry.  Further, the hotel is not safe for family as we found our front room guests drinking with room door open (this made our family so uncomfortable). The hotel staffs were also serving them items.  The food was horrible and the reception staff even did not give bill for food mentioning it was outsourced (although we made payment for food at reception).  I am trying to get details of owner so I can share my real experience in details with",Vikash825,/Profile/Vikash825,"Guwahati, India",10
haridwar,"i was there slightly early for check in in June 2015 , some dude called Ravi at reception who was reluctant to help nor ready to accept MMT confirmation on sms - tried to upsell rooms for higher price - from the confirmed price , He even went ahead to advise MMT that they could not accommodate and sold out for the dates which was not in case.  Front office  should learn to speak polite and be friendly if needs to be in hospitality business.   Location apprx 2.5 km from Har ki pauri in Bhoopatwala , Rooms shown was not clean either ,  Suggest  find alternate place plenty hotels nearby in that area.",Archit J,/Profile/Joshia007,"London, United Kingdom",20
haridwar,"I selected this hotel because they shown their proximity from Har Ki Paudi. But, actually it was located near bhupatwala, 2.5 Kms from Har ki paudi. Overall, clean and airy hotel. One can opt it if you have your own vehicles.",Anilesh R,/Profile/567anileshr,"Lucknow, India",30
haridwar,"This place gives us extremely pleasant experience in terms of location, space, cleanliness and food. Food is NOT deep froze, made warm and served; like in every regular restaurant. They buy raw food and cook on demand only with utmost hygiene. The entry in the huge kitchen is not restricted, guests can go in and see. The staff if very courteous. I first came here in Nov 2008. I came to same place in June 2014 because of pleasant service experience in the past.",kamalkschauhan,/Profile/kamalkschauhan,"New Delhi, India",50

haridwar,"Haridwar is not necessarily a chaotic mish mash of smells, sounds and sights. It can also be a serene, spiritual place it used to be. I discovered this only after I stayed a few days in Laxmi Sadan.  A little away from Har Ki Pauri (thankfully), this place gives you the chance to reconnect with the inner you - the real objective of any pilgrimage.  The staff is friendly and warm. And the biggest surprise will be waiting for you at the dining hall. Well, I am not going to reveal it...",mookherjee,/Profile/mookherjee,Delhi,50
