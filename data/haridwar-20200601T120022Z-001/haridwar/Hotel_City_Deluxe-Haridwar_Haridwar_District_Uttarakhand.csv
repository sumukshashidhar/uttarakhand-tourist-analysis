haridwar,"I stayed in this hotel during September 25 - 26, 2016. I preferred this hotel because the public parking was just adjacent to this hotel. In Haridwar, parking is really a problem, if you prefer a hotel near Har ki Paudi. This hotel that way offers good of both the world, as it is near Har ki Paudi (around 1 km) and public parking. I was given room number 401 (3rd floor with lift) that offered exquisite view of the river Ganges and the Chandi mountain. Room size was ok. (13' x 11'). Amenities were just basic but ok for the charges of this hotel. The hotel staff are very courteous and I can name Shashi and Narinder, who rendered excellent service. The room service was good. Only issue is that the maintenance of the property leaves much to be desired.",ddebabrata2016,/Profile/ddebabrata2016,"Ghaziabad, India",40
haridwar,"We stayed here for two days, had an AC room. The rooms were fine, washroom was clean and room service was also good. We had comfortable stay, we also had breakfast and it was good. The hotel is good if most of the time you are out and come back just for the sweet slumber as we did. Its a budget hotel and do not expect much luxuries. But its close by to ghats and hence good choice.",AkanshaSharma16,/Profile/AkanshaSharma16,"Ghaziabad, India",30
