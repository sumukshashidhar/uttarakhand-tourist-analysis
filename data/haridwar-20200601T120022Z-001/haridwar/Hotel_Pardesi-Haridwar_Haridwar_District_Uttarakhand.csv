haridwar,"My self with family booked rooms and asked to pay 50 % advance. We have paid Rs.6600 and as per schedule we are not able to come, so we have asked to use the payment for use after 1 week. Informed the same and they have confirmed the same. But on arrival we were told that they will not provide room and advance amount will not be refunded. They have simply rejected us and we have booked in another hotel and returned. So they cheated us for Rs.6600. Please stay away from the hotel. Cheating people. Don't pay any advance. You will be the next one.",Prabhakar,/Profile/Prabhakarmadurai,"Madurai, India",10
haridwar,"This place is run by a Punjabi. The gentleman is very nice and polite.  The rooms are small but neat and clean. The food here is excellent. Though I always love nonvegetarian food, I really enjoyed vegetarian food here. Hotels in Haridwar serve only veg food.  The only negative part about this hotel is that it is situated inside a small lane and it becomes difficult to take a big car inside the lane, though the hotel staff had been quite helpful with our baggages during checkin and checkout as we had senior citizens with us.",desaiardeshir,/Profile/desaiardeshir,"Mumbai, India",40
haridwar,"IN MY EXPERIENCE, NEVER BOOK THIS HOTEL.  I booked this hotel through Booking.com for the stay of 1 night starting from 15th - 26th May'2019. I booked in well advance around mid of April'2019.At the time of booking, the booking.com gave me the option to pay on reaching hotel. The price was then around 1800/- for the night. I booked this hotel for my parents who are quite old.  On 25th on reaching to the hotel, the management said they can't arrange the room as they sent an email to us and we did not respond.   Actually they sent this email on 24th evening when my parents were already in the train.  Over the call they continuously blaming me that I don't follow the email. I expected a ph call at least from the hotel in this scenario.Even in the call hotel said:  ""DO WHATEVER YOU",Indranil Naskar,/Profile/indranil_naskar,"Kolkata, India",10
haridwar,"The rooms, don't go by the pictures. The room offered was small and bathroom was too small. They do not provide water bottle but RO water and no exhaust in the room. Infact they have little windows. How you expect us to open window along with AC  Too noisy entire night. No toilet paper. The bathroom stinks so much , god knows from where that smell was coming. We just had to spend one night so we didn't complaint. Bed and pillow super uncomfortable and low in quality. On checkout ,the guy handled me kitchen bill with the total amount . He gave me original bill when  I question him if this is the only bill he is going to provide for my stay.  Not worth the amount payed.  The best part about the hotel is location. Not as in Hotel as it is in narrow lanes but it is in centre. So you",Ila,/Profile/ilathakur80,"New Delhi, India",30
haridwar,"Had a pleasant stay. The rooms are comfortable with hot and cold water facility on call, AC, free WiFi, room service, complementary breakfast and a very helpful and cooperative staff. Cons: 1. The room we stayed didnt have a cupboard. 2. The approach road is crampy and parking space is an issue. Though the hotel staff helps u out to find a comfortable space on the same road.",Ashok_p04,/Profile/Ashok_p04,,50
haridwar,"Booked the hotel online . The hotel is located close to the market and at ok distance from har ki pauri. It’s a little tuff to locate and approach the hotel as it’s situated in tight lanes of the area but reaching by e rickshaw and paddle rickshaw is not difiifcult and such mode of transport is easily available outside the hotel to move around . We booked the triple family room and rooms are decent and fairly spacious . Washrooms are ok too but lack exhaust fans and ventilation . Service is good and staff is friendly and cooperative . Room service  is available and food is good too and is made as per your requirements . Overall I would suggest this property In terms of a reasonable , budget , short stay with almost all the basic amenities and comfort .

haridwar,"Stayed here 2 nights. Was pretty good for the price for 10people. Staff were very helpful all hours of the day and night. Comfy bed, room is fairly clean and bathroom is good. Really good Chai too!  No heating though which was bad cos it was very cold! Biggest downfall was when I requested an extra towel and there was a bug or bird poo on it. So that let it down a little. Id still recommend but maybe check the towels first! ",Yasmine Y,/Profile/512yasminey,"Campbelltown, Australia",30
haridwar,I stayed in this hotel with my family during my Haridwar visit. The hotel is situated at a walkable distance from Haridwar railway station. The room was spacious and clean. The staff was friendly and services offered here was satisfactory. We preferred to eat outside as there were many restaurants nearby.,niya27,/Profile/niya27,,50
