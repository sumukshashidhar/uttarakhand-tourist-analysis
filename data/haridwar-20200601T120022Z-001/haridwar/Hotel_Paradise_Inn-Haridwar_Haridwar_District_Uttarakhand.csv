haridwar,"The rooms in this hotel are small and service we found was slow during our stay at haridwar. Wifi was off the whole time and service was ok. The heater were not working for 3 days as well as the lift in here was the dangerous one as there was an accident which took place as lift door would just shut ""bang"" each time if someone had to come in.There was an incident were an aunties hand was saved by seconds due to this and hotel owners didnt have the courtesy to apologize for the same. Please find these points to improve on a better service",Devashish Rege,/Profile/dev_rege,"Mumbai, India",10

haridwar,This hotel was booked by tour operator so I cannot comment on cost of the hotel. The hotel is located near Har Ki Pauri. the location is good and the rooms have space sufficient for two person.  the person on reception were cooperative but the  staff for room service are inexperienced. we had to ask for each and every thing from soap to towel. the restaurant menu card showed lots of options but very few things were available.  ,babita13,/Profile/babita13,"Jaipur, India",30
