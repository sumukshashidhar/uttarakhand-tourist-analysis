haridwar,"The location of this hotel is perfect, just few steps from Har ki Powdi however the hotel condition is not good. .Dirty unhygenic rooms, no room service, no intercall phones, no hot water. Even few steps from River Ganga, this hotel always has water crisis.  Sorry I will never stay here. Will look for other good hotel..",Aseem S,/Profile/aseems2018,"New Delhi, India",20
