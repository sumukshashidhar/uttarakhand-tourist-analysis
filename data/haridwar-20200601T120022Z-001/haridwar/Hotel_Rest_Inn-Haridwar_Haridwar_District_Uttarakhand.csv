haridwar,"No ventilation in rooms, from last two years construction is still going on. Water leakage on the stairs is very common whenever water tanks gets overflown.  Toilets are very bad.  Room space is very small. No hangers & space available for hanging clothes. Bad Smell of Humidity inside. No fire exist. Front office guys are very unfriendly. Geisure seldom works.  Non-consumable drinking water is supplied. Lot of bargaining in Rates, Last year I got the rooms @ 1000 Rs when it was season time. In off-season, they offered price @ 1850 Rs while they finally offered @750 Rs after lot of bargaining. Service quality had been dropped a lot from last year.  Bed sheets were very dirty. Changed after so many reminders.  Blanked offered is very light , no protection from winter specially",Neeraj S,/Profile/neerajs265,"Faridabad, India",20
