haridwar,"I went to this hotel for 1 night stay. A budget hotel true, but should have maintained properly. Walls near to lift dirty. cigarette smoke smell in room. Curtains broken. Shower broken, complained about that but in vain no one in there to listen your complains. Overall worst experience. One good thing hotel near to Hari ki Pauri and Market area. No parking facility. Park at your own risk on main road. I will never suggest anyone for this hotel. A big No.",Manish K,/Profile/kmanish87,"Faridabad, India",10

haridwar,"I truly hope this review saves someone from choosing this place. I'm backpacking through India and hostels are better than this place. It is far from where you want to be as a tourist which is funny because its called Le Central. It may be in the center of the city but you come to Haridwar for the ganga, religious ceremonies, temples etc. and those are all in kharkhri the part of Haridwar! Stay there instead. Don't be fooled by the nice looking room. It and the boys helping you to your room are the only nice things about this hotel. Tv and phone didn't work, not that I care much. They brought me a bottle of water without me asking and then charged me at the end. No free breakfast. Bad WiFi. Very very very loud outside- honking cars all day and night. Don't plan on sleeping if",Michael S,/Profile/michaelsK1105DX,,10
haridwar,"My fiancé and I had the most wonderful stay at Le Central Hotel. The beds were like sleeping back home (North America), the place was clean and large, and the service exceeded our expectations. The staff the front desk made us feel very welcome and helped us out with any questions we had. They also told us how much a rickshaw should cost and told us about the shared rickshaws which are only 15 rupees each to save us money. I really appreciated their consideration and hospitality.   There is also a fabulous restaurant directly across the street called ""Fun N Food"" which is the best Indian food I have had in Haridwar.   I would recommend Hotel Le Central in a heartbeat!

haridwar,"We found this hotel online and booked two suites. Really nice/comfy beds, clean place, good room service. Though the resturant is not continuously functional, but the cook makes yummy food when ordered. It is quite close to Had-ki-Paudi yet away from the din. It is quite in the heart of the city and it is pleasant to walk in the evenings. Not a very famous hotel but i think they could do with some publicity. Reasonably priced and polite staff. Now the best part.....We had tucked away our worn clothes in one of the cupboards and forgotten about it completely. We realised only after a week and when we called, they offered to send back all of it and didnot even take money inspite of us offering to do so. Great hospitality and great & honest team!",Shweta Sarkar G,/Profile/shwetasarkarg,"New Delhi, India",50
haridwar,"The rooms are nice, spacious, comfortable and clean. The hotel is well located in market area with restaurants around. I think the reception should be more impressive (its in basement and very basic). The reservation confirmation shows parking but there is no parking, we had to park on the roads though it was safe. The Wi-fi is very slow, you better make your own arrangements for data.",kishorjetwani,/Profile/kishorjetwani,"New Delhi, India",40
haridwar,"I came here with family during my holy visit to haridwar. We decided to stay here because it was near to railway station. Hotel does not meet our expectation. It not proper maintain, i dont know how they are doing business. Bed sheet and room was not properly clean. Will not visit again.   ",Manish S,/Profile/916manishs,,20
haridwar,"Had a pleasant stay. I visited Haridwar with my in-laws and wanted a comfortable stay. The hotel met up our expectations. The executive rooms were spacious and washrooms were very clean. Staffs were courteous and very supportive. Away from the crowd, we wanted a silent place from staying. Well communicated to railway station, bus stand and even Delhi-Dehradun Highway. Would recommend others to book directly instead of third party travel portals, for better deals.",JeetKabasi,/Profile/JeetKabasi,"New Delhi, India",50
haridwar,rooms are filled with DUST AND LINEN is soiled and used linen.. linen is so dirty that i didn't use bed. worst than railway cleanliness is the description of this hotel hygiene. Staff is not there to clean rooms and they are simply offering  excuse of shortage of staff,ngtraveller2015,/Profile/ngtraveller2015,"Navi Mumbai, India",10
haridwar,"We checked in post mid night with parents. The rooms were damp and smelly, inspite of repeated requests, the rooms was not changed. Washrooms were very dirty with human excreta stuck to the pots. Staff is very inefficient and laid back. Breakfast inclusion was a farce, barely had any options. Very avoidable place, not even worth a night stay.",Priya10Mittal,/Profile/Priya10Mittal,"Gurgaon, Haryana, India",10
haridwar,"Location of this hotel is good, however rooms are not worth the price quoted. Hopeless Front desk. I booked this hotel on my Haridwar trip, when we reached this hotel there was Electricity cut at that time, I asked If Power Back-up is available, the guy at reception told, within 1 min Power Back-up will start, as I went to see the hotel room, I used my mobile torch for same, as it was all dark. After ten minutes I asked the reception guy again, why power back-up is not started, he was blank. In the mean-time I saw another hotel staffer carrying empty Diesel can, for getting fuel for Power-Backup genset, then I immediately got out of the hotel in search of other...",Sumit B,/Profile/Placid79,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",20
haridwar,"We checked into this hotel at 1;30am with parents and had made prior reservations. Had asked for 2 rooms next to each other... Got rooms across the hall... Parents room had sewer smell when we asked for it to be changed staff said this is the only room left so we had no choice but to stay in that room given the late night... during the night AC also stopped working in their room and nobody fixed it and to make matters worse room had no window either... Our room was ok, bathroom though was another story... Commode had the paper band showing it had been cleaned, when we opened the lid it had pee stains, commode was dirty inside too, stains on the cover...Shower head fell on my head when i started taking shower, glass partition of the shower had stains as if it has never been",Nitin39,/Profile/Nitin39,"Nairobi, Kenya",10
haridwar,"The staff in this hotel are very friendly and helpful, unfortunately the hotel itself doesn't measure up. I stayed for one night (arriving and leaving by train) and the location is not so close to the Railway station as I thought and also far off the main attractions of Haridwar. Construction work was going on in the entrance area  (which is unfortunate for me, but temporary). The rooms were very moist, the clothes I took out of the bag had a funny smell and were rather wet the next morning. Also price-to-value was not good, given the conditions of the rooms I would not want to pay more than 1000 INR per night.",konradfandl,/Profile/konradfandl,"Vienna, Austria",20
haridwar,"The location is only 2 Kms from haridwar railway station. Although it is away from major attractions like Gangaghat, Shantikunj ashram etc. Rooms are clean and spacious. The only problem was hot water in bathroom. The tap water is not hot enough considering the cold weather in haridwar.",chinmaygajjar,/Profile/chinmaygajjar,"Vadodara, India",40
