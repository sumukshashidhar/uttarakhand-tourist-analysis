haridwar,"As we have to stay in haridwar. We chose Hotel Rudraksh Inn as it is 1km away from HARKIPODI. When we entered the staff took our bags and kept in the rooms. The service is awesome. And the food is delicious. If u are going to stay in this hotel u should try the food. The staff is very good. The rooms are very clean and good at a very reasonable price. U can also book tickets of activities like boat raffting in rishikesh from here. Its awesome. It was my best experience till now in hotel rudraksh inn. No problem of parking, No problem of food, No problem of hygiene etc...Its awesome üëç",Harsh M,/Profile/HarshM282,,50
haridwar,I select this hotel just for urgency. But when I get services which are an expected. All room corners are neat and well mentioned.. Rooms view for city is open road side. Food is also good. They served me late night too. Management is friendly,Vik C,/Profile/898vikc,,50
