haridwar,"Easy accessible approach to Hotel is a big advantage. Room was good, staff was co-operative and owner also was helpful . . Close vicinity to Ganga is a great Plus point and the market is also good in the vicinity . Areas to improve are cleanliness and Room service. But overall a good Budget Hotel for an overnight stay near Ganga in Haridwar that too is not far away from Haridwar Railway Station and Bus Stand.",kudurgesh,/Profile/kudurgesh,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30

haridwar,"I had booked a room at Hotel Aditya through a  3rd party website and come to find out there are two Hotel Aditya's-the one right on the Ganges and the Sheraton. Through the third party website it was not clear that there were two.  Upon entering, I was given a room that reeked of smoke and was very dirty. The TV did not work and the bathroom had holes in the wall. Plus, the staff greeted me with unsealed water. And the bath room only had cold water. The only thing that worked was the ceiling fan.   I would not suggest booking this hotel.",_vddamico84,/Profile/_vddamico84,"San Francisco, California",10
haridwar,"It was a bad very experience with Hotel Aditya Shariton, Very bad service and rooms were very dirty  On net while booking it was showing different types of room and not the actual one. Very bad experience.              ",pramodr348,/Profile/pramodr348,Mumbai,20
