haridwar,It was a awesome experience to stay in ganga exotica. The room is well equipped with all amenities with experienced staff. The felling to have a cup of tea seating on a terrace with a mindblowing view of ganga is unexplainable. The reception and management is having a vast experience of decades to handle its clients.

haridwar,"I have lost the count on how many times I have stayed at this Hotel. Myself, my wife and my elder brother stayed at this hotel for 5 days and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. All the hotel staff were polite, courteous and very helpful with smile on their face whenever you see them. General Manager Mr, C S Bhatnagar and Manager Mr B S Rawat were also very helpful and made our stay very relaxing. We never felt it like hotel but like our second home, The rooms were what we were looking, spacious with all the facility and sit at the window watching River Ganga flowing past. Mr Rawat also helped and arranged the transport for visiting Neelkanth Mahadev Temple as well as Mussoorie. Neelkanth Mahadev Temple was well worth the visit. We couldn't visit Mussoorie due to heavy snowfall",andysolanki,/Profile/andysolanki,"Greater London, United Kingdom",50
haridwar,"We are two foreigners who arrived very early to Haridwar! Our hotel booked our rooms out because our train was delayed so we were left searching for a place to stay at 5am! Hotel Ganga took us in with pleasure and got us a cosy room! The room is really comfortable with a big double bed, nice toilet, hot shower and WiFi. We even requested an extra blanket because it‚Äôs very cold during December and they went above and beyond to bring it to us and even provided us with a heater! Room service was good too we called for some bottled water and two minutes later it arrived! Fantastic service. They also booked us a taxi to Rishkesh.   Only improvement could be the breakfast but really a great place to stay!   Thank you üôèüèª",Robynne Esther,/Profile/BakerBobbie13,,40

The rooms are smaller than they show in pictures, it had a small AC, attached to let with hot water geazer, a twin bed, TV However a  room fridge was missing.

After reading good reviews by other travelers, I booked this hotel out of three other hotels - Havelli Hari Ganga, Hotel Ganga Lahri and Hotel Devnadi. I must say that we really liked this hotel.   We booked a suite which had river facing room.  What we liked:- 1. Since its little before Har ki Pauri area, so its away from the crowded area. You can take your car till the hotel, drop luggage and then park it in a public parking very nearby. From hotel one can take a rickshaw to reach Har ki Pauri or take own vehicle, it is just 5 minutes drive from Har ki Pauri.

haridwar,stayed in this hotel from 14th till 17th of December in room no. 301 (no Ganga facing) Previously called Ganga Kinare - it is a refurbished property. Rooms are categorised in two - Ganga and non Ganga facing (like most of the hotels in vicinity- this too is situated directly over Ganges). The Ganga facing rooms are charged more ( can't see a particular reason behind that - maybe foreigners are more interested). This is situated on Niranjan Akhara road - very near to Vishnu chowk and not so far from Har ki Pauri. Service in the hotel is very good i must say. Toiletries were good and adequate. Room cleaning was always done promptly and i found them smelling good - so they must have been using good room fresheners.Washrooms are clumsily built though. the separation is a glass one,BackPacker813873,/Profile/BackPacker813873,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
haridwar,We went to haridwar in month of October. Since it was a sudden plan so we could not get chance to book hotel in advance so Ganga Exotica was the one which we found through Trip Advisor. Rooms cost was Rs 6500 but they give us discount and it charged is Rs 3000 for 1 day. Rooms are too small as per the cost. Also they are 2 tables which are really not required in such a small room.

The management of Ganga exotica explained it was precisely the same recurring confusion that prompted them to change the name. They were genuinely sympathetic n offered me a room .

The hotel is very neat and clean. We stayed in the family suit with gangs view and absolutely loved it. The breakfast spread was not very impressive but sufficient. There is no restaurant but food is delivered in the room. The food was good and tasty and value for money. The private ghat was really good and clean but you need to climb down a steep staircase to reach it so if you have members with difficulty in walking it might be an issue.

haridwar,"We stayed in the Hotel Ganga Exotica in April 2017 with family.  It was a good experience. The rooms are decent, however the glass walls of the bathrooms are not completely opaque. This is slightly inconvenient. But the view from the Ganga facing rooms are excellent, there is a private ghat as well. The hotel is very close to the parking, which is another advantage. But on the other hand, this hotel is a bit far off from Har Ki Pauri... however, rickshaws are always available, so I guess that is only a minor inconvenience. They also provide additional facilities like arranging panditji for puja etc.  Most importantly, the staff is extremely helpful.

haridwar,"Hotel Ganga Exotica, formerly known as Ganga Kinare, was exemplary with regards to the hospitality offered by the entire staff. Mr Bhatnagar was a gracious host, attentive to the needs of his guests. Same goes for the rest of the employees, from room service to kitchen and restaurant staff.  The stunning view of the Ganga river from our family room was beyond anything words can describe. Right from our suite and its two bathrooms to the private ganga ghat maintained by the hotel, everything was spic and span. Since my father had dietary restrictions, the staff followed our instructions, regarding his meals, very carefully. Really nice and accommodating of them.

Rooms are small (I suppose all hotels over there have small rooms) but neat and clean. Staff is courteous; service is prompt.  Hotel has good Wi-Fi. Breakfast was good. GM of the hotel is very friendly and gave us lot of information about nearby places. There is a deluxe suite facing the river that can accommodate 4 persons. This would be a good option for a small group to go for this rather than asking for 2 separate rooms.,Sudha K,/Profile/Sudha0503,"Mumbai, India",50

The staff was very courteous and helpful. The roof top restaurant has an alluring view of Ganga and the food was extremely delightful. Hot and sour soup is highly recommended. Private bathing ghat is a plus. Overall it was a super relaxing trip and because of this hotel i didn't want to come back. Thanks Ganga Exotica for making our stay a memorable one..!!

Rooms are clean and well maintained like star rated hotels,as our stay was in suit so can not write about other deluxe rooms.Only suits are having private balcony to sit and enjoy the Ganges view.Other rooms have window towards Ganges.

The glass sealed window in the room is required to  be open for fresh air. The lobby was small ,lift was not upto the mark . The root terrace restaurant was good and had good view of Ganga river.There was no arrangements of tea n coffee jug in the room. The staircase is narrow . The front view from the room opens to bye lanes .Not  worth for heavy price.  I prefer to  pay same price  n stay in better atmosphere. ",manuchainani,/Profile/manuchainani,"Mumbai, India",30

The lift was very small, if four people have to take the lift they would just fit in the lift  Overall if you are planning to book a suite , then you can stay here given that smell is not there and they dont offer you basement room  And the last thing, the prices mentioned on any travel website for them, you",Amit K,/Profile/asda2233,dfsas,30
