haridwar,Well this place cannot and should not be called a Hotel. They have no idea about the hospitality industry. Services at a cheap lodge or Dharamshala are much better. I had some guests over and took them to Melrose Inn. My guests underwent great misery while they stayed there and I faced a lot of personal embarrasment thanks to the poor services and inept management. The moment you step in the misery begins. The ID proof takes overnight to be returned. You enter the room only to see dirty bed linen and no towels. You call house keeping and they tell you that the linen was changed only yesterday. Upon your raising the issue the bedlinen is changed very reluctantly. The room service is bad and the food unpalatable. You wake up in the morning only to realise there is no running hot,theclassof88,/Profile/theclassof88,Hardwar.,10
