haridwar,I visited the Chotiwala restaurant near Ram jhula. There are two side by side. I visited the right side one. The food is tasty and easy on the stomach. The service is prompt and courteous. I would like to visit again,PRASAD S,/Profile/savs7,"Hyderabad, India",40
haridwar,This appeared to be a disinterested place. The tables had to be cleaned ( were done on prompting). The service at the restaurant was slow. The AC doesnt work most of the time. The food was a tad spicier than usual. Could be avoided if possible.,kodasrivatsa,/Profile/kodasrivatsa,"Mumbai, India",30
haridwar,"We asked to our agent to book a hotel near Har ki pauri and he booked the hotel Chotiwala for us for a night. We were five. Hotel provided us a four bedded room at first floor. No extra bed was there so,we five adjusted with the same. Room was not up to the mark but a  Split Ac was there which was in working condition. After a long journey by road,we were feeling tired and slept peacefully. Bathroom was so so and the ceiling of the bathroom was damp. The hotel is situated near Har ki pauri and there are many stalls in front of the hotel so,it is a plus point to stay at this hotel.",sanaser,/Profile/sanaser,Ludhiana,30
haridwar,"Note: This review is only about the restaurant.  We had dinner for two days from here. The food seemed to be nice and fresh. The service was fast too. The only negative I felt is that the toilets are very bad, and I keep seeing people waiting for their turn. In case the owners happen to read this, please increase the number of toilets and improve the quality of them.",vmaravind,/Profile/vmaravind,"Bengaluru, India",30
haridwar,Pathetic location. Poor service and arrogant staff. Greedy behaviour. Proclaimed AC does work without remote and poorly functional. Gyeser is not available in all claimed rooms. Door lock does not work. You can hear footprints through closed windowAmbience is so loud.,Virendra Singh,/Profile/virendrasingh,"New Delhi, India",10
haridwar,"There are several Chotiwalas in Hardware/Rishikesh belt; this is one of them. The location of the restaurant makes it easy to stop by, whether you are coming in to Haridwar or going out. But the food is just about average and the hygiene standards are far from satisfactory. The service is swift though. There's a better restaurant right next to this.

haridwar,"Our driver made us stop at this hotel for breakfast as we started out from Haridwar to Rudraprayag. Almost everything that we ordered from the menu tasted below average and was under cooked. We ordered different tandoori paranthas with various stuffings. What was brought on the table was one kind of parantha with all stuffings mixed in! To top it all, the paranthas were not even cooked well. The puris in the puri subzi were under cooked. Even the tea did not taste proper. We had to keep the fans on in full swing as flies were swarming near our tables.",Karishma K,/Profile/KarishmaK319,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",10
haridwar,"Good hotel with pure vegetarian food.It's one of the oldest restaurant in Haridwar, the food is good, their rasmalai (sweet) is worth trying.Too expensive when compared to quality and service. Over all a average hotel.",xyz1234578910,/Profile/xyz1234578910,"Haridwar, India",30
haridwar,"First there are two chotiwalas ,and again inside these there are a/c and non a/c compartments.  I visited one  on the left with A/c  , food is so so , they have different thalis , I preferred Bengali Thali  , But that thali was just in name , it does not match anything with Bengali Cuisine  Cleanliness is ok",Sanjay648,/Profile/Sanjay648,"Silchar, India",30
