haridwar,"No matter what anyone says,  NEVER GO TO THIS HOTEL!!  My mom's friends who did the booking got fooled into thinking that this place has a good location. No it does not, there are hotels which have much better location. And now let's start the horror story. First and foremost, this place has two employees, one is the receptionist and the other is the bell boy. The rooms are hideous and are in dreadful condition. There are cracks in the walls and the bedsheets are dirty and have holes. Now, what about food? Coming to that. We ordered Dal Chawal for 6 people. We got the Dal Chawal and 2 plates with it. We said we needed 6 plates. They said their plates are finished because the other guests have also ordered food. Bad,  right? Wait, there is more. We were travelling with a little 4",Naina Khurana,/Profile/Naina123Khurana,,10

haridwar,Do not book online without having conversation for these points. 1. Book a room if available in ground or first floor in online booking they mentioned that 4th floor a.c. room and not mentioned that they do not have a lift. However I found windows a.c. in my room quiet noisy 402 so after request to care taker mr.sanjay he shifted me to another room 401. During light of or voltage fluctuation a.c. will not work. It is near to railway station and not advisable to go with car because it's situated in naroow space. However e vehicle facility is available and fare of hotel to railway station 25rs/Traveller. In 500 RS for 4hrs all evehicle person will take you too full haridwar darshan.,Jv1,/Profile/jvshah111,"Mandvi, India",40

haridwar,Hotel is in a good location 5 minutes walk from the Haridwar Junction railway station. Rooms are well air conditioned.  WiFi is limited to hallways and lobby - not in rooms. When we arrived we had dirty sheets. We had to ask twice for them to be changed. It's a basic hotel but fine for a night or two if you're on a budget.,Chrisjam1996,/Profile/Chrisjam1996,"Greater Manchester, United Kingdom",20
haridwar,"Sheets were dirty when we arrived so had to ask for them to be changed in both our double room. Asked for wifi code on arrival and was told to wait 30 minutes. Then came back and asked to wait another hour, then went for dinner and came back and asked to wait 15 more minutes, finally received the code late at night. No hot water for our shower, whilst our tap dripped the whole night making a noise.

haridwar,"I stayed in this hotel for two nights this month. The hotel was booked by the travel agent who I was working with for my trip to Kedarnath and Badrinath. We had booked 4 2-bedded rooms in this hotel. The rooms and the bathrooms were quite clean.All the bathrooms had geyser which are controlled from the reception. Whenever we wanted hot water we had to let the reception know and they would turn on the geyser. We did not have to use the AC. The fan was enough for us. The hotel is quite close to the main street and the station. However, for going to Har ki Pauri or the Ganga ghat, it is better to take a rickshaw or an auto. There are many restaurants (mainly Gujrati) nearby. They also have the luggage storage facility where we kept our extra luggage while we were away from",chak1014,/Profile/chak1014,"Kolkata, India",30
haridwar,I stayed in this hotel on 23rd May 2015 for one night. Basically this hotel as mentioned in tripadvisor is very near to the Railway station. Practically 10 minute walking distance but if you have huge luggage then better to take a Rickshaw. Hotel is inside an alley. Which is very quite after the night so it is better not to go out after 11.p.m  . Now I did not see any lift in this hotel.We stayed on the first floor. we checked in very late almost at 11.00 p.m but we informed them about it in advance.  Advantage:-  Near to station. Good stay for 1 night Near to Bus stand.  Courteous staff. and give you good suggestion for bus Bathroom is clean. They try their best to arrange for a rickshaw at morning 5 a.m  DIsadvantage:  There are many hotels near to station with better location,maitra920,/Profile/maitra930,"Kolkata, India",30
haridwar,"I stayed for 3 nights in this hotel in the second week of May in a AC room.I got carried away by the people who gave a decent rating to this hotel.The only advantage is the promixity to the railway station.Other than that I had felt lot of issues during stay.AC is switched on only when you persistently request the reception and the moment you leave your room AC control which is located in the reception is switched off.Again you have to bug the receptionist to switch on the AC.On the first day morning, I went to the receptionist who was watching TV busily to switch on water heater as he has the controls in the reception.He nodded couple of times and after 10 minutes also the water heater did not get switched on and after a while I spoke to him and he told me that he thought I was",saikumarnc,/Profile/saikumarnc,Chennai,20
haridwar,"I stayed here with family for one night. I booked two ac rooms. The place is ok, small rooms, beddings, not shiny clean, old tv, window ac which are not very effective. Location is near railway station but very much inside on small roads. The battery rickshaw or auto can go to hotel. The only positive point for me was the hotel manager allowed on room for two hrs.late check out. Also don't book taxi packages from these guys thete will be options cheaper than what hotel guys find out in name of helping.",slll31,/Profile/slll31,"Greater Noida, India",30

But even a single car cannot go in that road properly. We were really upset on that. But Hotel is so clean and rooms are average+. really nothing to complaint. There is really justice for the price we paid. No complaints on that. But i want to say only one thing, "" dont judge on the photos they placed at tripadvisor"" It's a budget+ hotel.

haridwar,"Location: Well, this hotel is around 3-4 minutes walk from the main road(Circle). Location wise its nice, Walking 7-8 mins to station Har ki pauri too nearby.  Room: The best thing about our stay was the cleanliness here. Floors on reception, gallery, room, toilets were all SPOTLESS, and trust me that's a rarity. Toilet was really clean, sanitized and big enough, had 24 hours hot Shower with good pressure.  Staff: I didnt interact much as was Out of the room for most of the time, just came back for sleeping, though Manger was polite and helpful.  Value: Full value for money. Will surely recommend this place.   P.S. its nearby the GUJARATI LANE where you can have awesome Gujarati nashta and food. Despite being a Delhiite, I just LOVE Gujarati food.",Puneet Yadav,/Profile/PuneetYadav17,"New Delhi, India",50
