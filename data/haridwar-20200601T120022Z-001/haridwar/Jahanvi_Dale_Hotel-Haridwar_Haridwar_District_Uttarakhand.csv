haridwar,"I am wondering why one should be staying at this location in the first place especially if you are there for leisure. And if you are there for business even then I am wondering how would the business man survive in this vicinity.  The hotel is bang on the highway with Ganges flowing on the other side of the highway. There are few more resorts in the neighborhood and that's about it. There are no restaurants, Dhabas in the near vicinity.  The hotel is small block with small lobby. The rooms are very average which needed airing as there was damp smell in them. The beds were basic and linen was average. There a decent flat panel tv with cable box. The bathroom is also average with timed hot water supply in morning. The drainage was an issue the bath linen was average.  Overall it",Deepak DB,/Profile/DeepakB90,"Mumbai, India",30
haridwar,"Looks to be decent, bed quality; clean bathroom  (exhaust is an issue). Delus room does not have a working fridge. Tap is poor quality, only shower comes. service is good. Extra bed had fresh lenin however, the blanket was stinking. On whole the price does not match the expectations. 2k for one night",DeekAKGAG,/Profile/DeekAKGAG,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",20
haridwar,"Hotel has worst services, staff is irritating, food quality so so , food menu is huge in size but nothing available when you order. Hotel on the main road and opposite Ganga Ghat with ample parking thats the only positive point else everything below avg",chandrasidharth,/Profile/chandrasidharth,"Solan, India",20

haridwar,"The hotel which is on the Delhi Haridwar Bypass is gud one.  Only point is rate which is slightly higher.  Overall the hotel is good. Room occupied by me was good, neat and clean. There is restaurant on first floor, but did not try it.  The receptionist told us that they are the best in food.",dksun2004,/Profile/dksun2004,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",40

haridwar,"The hotel is located on Delhi - Rishikesh highway and has a view of river Ganga from the front. The rooms are decently clean and the service is average. The hotel has a restaurant which serves good food, though it was priced at a little higher side. There are multiple ghats just opposite to the hotel, handy for a quick dip in the Ganges. Since it is located outside the city, very few shops/local diners can be found nearby.",IshiB,/Profile/IshiB,"Bengaluru, India",30
haridwar,"while leaving the hotel, hotel management started asking to pay the room charges which i had already paid to goibibo at the time booking and created mockery by harassing the we people (8 no.). Moreover hotel did not honour complimentary breakfast as per confirmation voucher issued by GOIBIBO. Even Air Conditioner did not work at all.",mahendra19512014,/Profile/mahendra19512014,"New Delhi, India",10
haridwar,This is an average property and is ok if you want to spend a night in Haridwar. It is conveniently located when coming from Delhi and can be easily located. Dont expect a luxury treatment but is a value for money stay.,Manoj,/Profile/mkbhadani,CHENNAI,30
haridwar,"I just came back from Jahanavi Dale,Haridwar today. This morning before leaving for Delhi,I went to their restaurant to have breakfast.When I came back to my room,I found a loss of Rs. 5000/- from my purse.I contacted the reception and they showed me their cctv footage which was clearly showing manipulation.Hotel staffs were not cooperating at all regarding the theft.I contacted a local person and gave away the responsibility.Anyone visiting Haridwar,I would like to suggest NOT TO STAY in that HOTEL anymore,if not URGENT.",Sadasivan515,/Profile/Sadasivan515,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",10
haridwar,"This hotel is at a peaceful location on the main Delhi-Haridwar Bypass Road, about 5-6 kms away from the Haridwar railway station and equally so from the Ghats where the Ganga Arti and all happen. They do have a bathing ghat right across the road but most people would prefer the Numbers and Holier atmosphere of the main Bathing ghat I suppose.   Service is good, people are willing to help and do so at all hours with a smile. Rooms are adequately furnished, though Standard rooms were a little cramped, and hence I say, 'Okay'. Bathrooms are clean and functioning but the flush is somehow not powerful enough :) and what sucks is the single drain outlet right near the bathroom door, under the sink. So even if you are washing your feet at the tap a couple of feet away, the water",dearsoum,/Profile/dearsoum,"Mumbai, India",40
