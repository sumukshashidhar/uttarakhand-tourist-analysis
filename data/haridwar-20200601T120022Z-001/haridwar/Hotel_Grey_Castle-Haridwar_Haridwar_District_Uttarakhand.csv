haridwar,"Sahil Arora was the one who managed our stay to the top level. He was just a call away. He managed our trips, arranged cabs and provided information about the good restaurants etc etc.  The hotel is just 1 km away from railway station and the rooms are spacious and clean. Thank you Sahil and Grey castle for our memorable stay. Will surely come again to avail such great services by Sahil Arora and staff.",Kunal Puri,/Profile/Kunalpuri2020,,50

haridwar,"I was in Haridwar during the peak season of June for some personal work relating to my business. Fortuitously I discovered Hotel Grey Castle. That saved me during the scorching heat of June in the mad, horrendous rush of Haridwar. Their room was well furnished with a flat screen TV.They had cold, filtered water for guests and room service from a nearby restaurant to boot!  As the hotel is located in one of the back lanes from Shivmurti chowk, there were plenty of dhabas for eating out. I ate at the Gujarati dhabas which were surprisingly good. Big Ben restaurant at Hotel Ganga Azure was a five minute walk for a more classy dining experience.   The best thing about Hotel Grey Castle was that it had wi-fi on each floor and a lift in working order. I could not ask for more.  The",Anjali P,/Profile/798anjalip,,50
