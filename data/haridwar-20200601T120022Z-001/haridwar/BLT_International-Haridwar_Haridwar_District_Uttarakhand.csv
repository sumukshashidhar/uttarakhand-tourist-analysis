haridwar,"I visited Haridwar in oct 2012 and stayed in Hotel BLT international.This hotel is situated on HAR KI PAURI , the most holy place in Haridwar.I stayed in this hotel for the second time as I like this hotel due to co-operative staff and neat and clean rooms. Some rooms are Gangaji facing. A/C  was also very effective , but only one drawback is there that there is no lift in hotel so there may be some problem with old persons  Thanks Rajesh Bansal",rajeshbansal1968,/Profile/rajeshbansal1968,delhi,30
