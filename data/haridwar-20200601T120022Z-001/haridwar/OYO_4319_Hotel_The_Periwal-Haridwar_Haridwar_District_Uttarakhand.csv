haridwar,Located very near to Shantikunj.  Rooms are good. The suite we booked was humongous with a ten seater sofa!  It was like a hall.  Service is extraordinary.  Mr. Anil at reception is a great guy.  Very humble and helpful.  He tries to help you genuinely.  Overall hotel is very good but there is one drawback that there is no kitchen so you cannot order anything. Not even tea/warm water. You will have to walk outside the hotel for food. 4/5,Ravi Singh,/Profile/r20897,"Allahabad, India",40
haridwar,"Worst hotel to stay. I visited this hotel in March. There was no cleanliness in hotel premises, bathroom was smelling and dirty bedding. Room service was not smooth and they irritated me by asking about bill every time I ordered as there was no option to pay for all order at check out. Their restaurant was in pathetic condition with sticky and dirty floor. More over there was no correlation between hotel persons and restaurant persons. I found only one positive  thing there and that was parking lot for vehicles but that was also in open.",Sunil D,/Profile/668sunild,,10
haridwar,"We visited Haridwar for a day on 22nd October and stayed at Hotel Devnadi- a heritage hotel. It's indeed a heritage property with unique ambience,location,service and hospitality. Although it is  costly by Haridwar standards but one can feel like a real Maharaja during stay. An exclusive Mandir for puja & arati and a private bathing ghat makes it  more attractive. Its vegetarian restaurant is strategically located at the best place of the property and serves unique and tasty foods as well. Staffs are polite and well mannered as well.  One can get value for money.",Sourajit G,/Profile/sourajit2014,,50
haridwar,"Very good and comfortable budget hotel. Room size big in affordable price. No tension of car parking, even bus parking. Free Wi-Fi. Beside shantikunj easy approach able. Food quality also fine. I am happy for staying here.",vikram s,/Profile/vikrams1499,,50
haridwar,"which means we got it probably better than other guests due to OYO's directive to hotels. We stayed for one night and were too tired but the experience was definitely just average and we did not  book it the next time. Some pros and cons are as follows:  Pros:  * Due to OYO, we got good toiletries (Biotique) and clean bedsheets * As we had to leave early next morning, we had to forgo our complimentary breakfast. But the kitchen, on finding about this, made sure we had atleast sandwiches before we started... which was a service highlight * Check in was smooth and so was the check out  Cons: * The overall service attitude is pretty average. At check-out the porter was more focused on loading our luggage onto the lift rather than to let the elders climb in and leave for the",deshanupam,/Profile/deshanupam,"Pune, India",30

haridwar,"This hotel does not have good staff and they are very unprofessional. When they handover room to guest they do not ensure equipment in rooms are working or not.  We availed the room in this hotel and found that TV in the room was not working, pillow cover was dirty, door lock was broken and we need to pin point each and every thing to get it rectify. But TV was not working after all the effort from hotel staff.   There are so many options in haridwar for hotel book it only when you do not get booking in other hotel. Hotel is around 5km away from har ki paudi and there is so much of rush and jam in haridwar on weekends so keep it in mind before booking.",Ravindra S,/Profile/ravindras501,,10

haridwar,Hotel is located right on the Haridwar - Rishikesh highway very close to Shantikunj entrance. If you are coming from Rishikesh via bus ask to be dropped off at Shantikunj. The hotel will be a 2 minute walk from there. You can get a share auto to Har ki Lauri easily. The rooms are quite spacious and service is very fast. Food was above average. Overall quite a good stay. ,surajm26,/Profile/surajm26,"Mumbai, India",40

haridwar,"Before I visited at this hotel in July month this year, I was not fully satisfied but in this month management services changed totally because of new owner. So, I decided to visit here again and again as this place is very peaceful and secure.",great1234994,/Profile/great1234994,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",50
haridwar,"I booked through Clear-trip and upon reaching the hotel, the manager said that their is no booking in my name, i was shocked and feeling helpless as my money has been paid to clear-trip, later it was found that its Cleartrip's mistake...they just sent the booking voucher to me and charged money from my credit card but Actually the room was never booked, me and my family was totally under the Mercy of Hotel manager...  Only rooms are big, so big that their AC are inefficient to cool those rooms.  No service, No drinking water, No Batching water, Dry Taps in bathroom...  No tea or room service ... pathetic experience...I do not recommend any family to stay there ..   I have kid with me and I have to go any buy milk, sugar etc for him in a rainy day to him..

haridwar,"There should hardly a 2nd chance I would take for this hotel. Only the room was biiiiiiiiggest nothing else is memorable.  No dining facility is here. If you ask for a breakfast they can serve you pakoda & tea with biscuit.  You ask for a meal, they will stand up  with Lou ki kofta, dal & roti/rice!!  Also these are served at least after 1hour.  The manager is very calm & quiet. But when you pay someone then the hotel should be that much of trustworthy to return you the value for money.  Also nearby you will find no restaurants so that you can make it up!   Har ki pauri is 3km away. The nearest ganga ghat is almost 1.5km by walk.  I stayed 2 days 3 nights from 6th-9th October. Will not recommend this for a family stay!",Soumendasgupta,/Profile/Soumendasgupta,Kolkata,20
