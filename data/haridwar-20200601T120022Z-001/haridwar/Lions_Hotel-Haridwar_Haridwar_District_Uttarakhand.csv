haridwar,"Very shabby room, with unclean toilets and bed linen. Had to move there on an emergency as we found no other rooms in May 2018. Moreover we needed to move to Kanpur from Haridwar urgently om taht very day we moved in. the Hotel owner's son looted us for 6 AC Sleeper Bus tickets @Rs.2100/- each, while they are available at @Rs.1100/- online. He took Rs.12600/- for 6 tickets but in the bus we found only 4 seats were available for us. These people are touts and dalals of the worst kind, ready to pounce on hapless travellers by being friendly and a 'Bengali' in the Hindi belt. They should be booked for fraud.",chamanas,/Profile/chamanas,"Kolkata, India",20
haridwar,"Hotel owner is not at all focused on Customer Service. Room was in horrible state. Mattress was of poor quality and it lead to my back pain. Pillow was stinking and quilt was of very quality. It’s started to itch on our skin after using that quilt. Cooler was generating a lot of sounds and was in state that it could stop working any time. If there is power cut, hotel staff takes 10 minutes to start generator. Washroom has indian toilet seat and was again in horrible state. If you complain anything to owner, he would say manager of that travel website ( from where we booked hotel room) is my batch mate. My family had horrible experience and they couldn’t sleep entire night because of such a horrible room.",anu a,/Profile/389anua,,10
