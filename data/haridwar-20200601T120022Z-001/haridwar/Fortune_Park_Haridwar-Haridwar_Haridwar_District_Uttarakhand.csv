haridwar,We liked the stay at this hotel...They have maintained the standard of Fortune brand...Good Front Office Staff....Very helpful....Housekeeping staffs always with a smile....Nice cozy restaurant....The waiting staff and the Chefs were all hospitable....Food was good....Overall a nice stay at this hotel.

haridwar,"Went for my grandfather Barkhi with family of 20. When you enter the hotel, there is absolute negativity with no hotel staff welcoming or smiling at you. Very Poor and slow check in procedure. We had to go to Ghat for rituals so asked hotel to pack breakfast for 10 people. They packed 10 Puri for 15 people. Female members who went for breakfast at 10.30 were denied breakfast. We do understand that live counters can be denied but even normal breakfast was denied. Informed hotel 30 min before about checkout but after coming on reception they took another 30 min to finish check out formalities. This hotel has a unique rule that i have not seen anywhere in the world - They will literally wait for each room card to be submitted back before they can raise your bill.

haridwar,"While this property was supposed to be in Haridwar, it was quite far from the town. So, it seemed like the place was in the middle of nowhere. And from the outside, the building looked quite odd. There was a shopping mall adjacent to this hotel, and the rooms on one side of the building had nothing but the walls of this adjoining mall, for a view. This definitely was odd. The gym hardly had any equipments - not sure if one could even call it functional. The service, in general, was slow, but manageable.  Above being said, the hotel was all right for a short layover. The rooms were clean, nicely designed and well-equipped. The breakfast spread was good, but some of the items were stale - pretty much their entire selection of pastries were inedible.

haridwar,"I had a brief stay of 1 day at the hotel while coming back from PaontaSahib. The location of the hotel is way ahead of the city on Delhi Highway, which is really far off if your purpose is to visit Haridwar!! Hotel is calm and peaceful since it is out of the city. Food quality served is ok but not up to the ITC and Fortune standards at other locations. Room was neat and clean and hygienic. However, in non peak seasons and if you are really up to visit haridwar, there are better and more convenient options available!!",sharmaashish041,/Profile/sharmaashish041,"Ghaziabad, India",30

Really bad.  - Requested for an extra bed, paid 1K INR plus taxes only to realize that they make the convertible sofa into the extra bed, and trust me, you can't sleep on it because it has an uneven surface. Ended up with a severe back pain and stiffness - Passage near my suite, 511 was full of leftovers, dirty plates and cutlery- despite informing the hotel staff, these were not cleaned/ cleared up for over 24 hours - Buffet spread is very average, had to keep asking",Shekhz,/Profile/Shekhz,"Singapore, Singapore",20
