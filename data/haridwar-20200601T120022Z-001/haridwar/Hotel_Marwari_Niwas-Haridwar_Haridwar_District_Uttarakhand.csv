haridwar,"I booked this hotel for family stay during our trip to Haridwar. The hotel is located in main market and close to main attraction har ki pauri (1 km) also very near to Mansa Devi entrance.  coming to hotel appearance is very basic and old. Room was basic with attached bathroom,TV nothing much. Hotel does provide breakfast,lunch and dinner ( i have not tried though) we stayed there for 4 nights but none of staff turned up for cleaning of the room.",ManojChhablani,/Profile/ManojChhablani,"Bengaluru, India",30
haridwar,This place is very close to the holy Ganga ghat. Don't expect too much from this place. Rooms and bathrooms are not neat.  The staffs are also not very friendly. Not at all a value for money. Another plus about this place is that this place is close to the market as well as the railway station.,Abhishek beria,/Profile/Abhishekberia,"Bengaluru, India",30
haridwar,The hotel is situated near Har Ki Pauri ghat and that's all about. Nothing to say about this hotel. Standard air cooled rooms are nothing but like cell of Jail without any window and Deluxe rooms are so so. No geyser or amenities are there. Rooms are shabby and basic. Toilets are also basic. If anyone wants to stay in a very tight budget then you can book room here and don't complain on any subject. Don't blame management because they are actually helping people by providing very very basic facilities at a low price. Staff are helpful. Try to book deluxe rooms. ,KALYAN R,/Profile/851kalyanr,"Kolkata, India",20
haridwar,"We have stayed there in march 2016. A good Hotel Marwari Niwas, It is good for budget hotel finders. This Hotel is walking distance from Har Ki Pauri Ghat and Subhash Ghat.

haridwar,"It was overdue... Right in the heart of the city, Marwari Niwas was indeed value for money. On one hand it is 6 to 10 mins walking distance from Har-Ki-Pauri (Ganga Ghat) and on the other side 2 mins walking distance from Mansa Devi temple. There used to be a rooftop restaurant but not any more. A kitchen is there for room service. There are plenty of food-joint in & around the place. So really, you dont' need hotel's food. This Hotel used to be a Dharmashala, now they are trying hard to make a decent Hotel. By the way, there are plenty of Hotel/Niwas located in this excellent vicinity. All one has to do is find a decent one based upon one's budget. Tips: Try to book front side rooms. Rickshaw rent for individual basis like the Auto in Kolkata.

haridwar,"I travel Haridwar frequently even sometime for few hours. My recent visit was on 4th and 5th of January 2016 and I got a chance to book this Marwari Niwas hotel. Yeahh it's true I was also surprised to see such cheap price and expected nothing much. I had to check-in late night so I informed the front office. I reached hotel around 10:30 pm. All things found ok. Room is good with attached bathrooms, TV and coolers will make you realise it is worth of money. I woke up early morning and walked 5 minutes to reach Har Ki Pauri (main ghat) and had holy bath of Ganges. I turned back to hotel as I had to take my train. Apart from my this visit I found that the location of this hotel is perfect. It is the center point. The ropeway to Mansa devi is just 100 meters away.

haridwar,"We went for a family trip to Haridwar on June 2015. We were a group of 6 and took two rooms here. We booked the hotels before going. The hotel is situated at a great location just behind the main road. Manasa Pahar, Har Ki Paudi Ghat and Vishnu Ghat are all at a 5 min walking distance from this place. The hotel architecture is also good. It has a few sofas and resting place in the ground floor. We opted for air-cooled rooms at the 1st floor and the price at which we got the room is satisfactory. The staffs of the hotel are very friendly and polite enough. But what I would suggest after my visit is that I think they need to be more concerned about the cleanliness. We stayed there for 4 days. Only 2 days the rooms were mopped. The pillows were very dirty and we used our personal",Souvik Saha,/Profile/ssouvik34,"Kolkata, India",30

haridwar,"Recently, due to a bereavement in the family, I had to visit the Holy City of Haridwar. Though a good number of quality hotels have come up in Haridwar, the preferred option is always near to the main bathing Ghat i.e. Har Ki Pauri ( Step towards God ). In the crowded market place Marwari Niwas is a compact old time guest house which has tried to keep up with the times by refurbishing the rooms and adding aircon.  The rooms are of all sizes-- very small to large and are priced accordingly. The rates are okay in line with the trends locally. There is a roof top restaurant which was not there in my earlier visit about nine years ago. The food quality is just about okay. In haridwar, there are so many food options if one just steps out of the hotel, so the hotel food does not",pramod2512,/Profile/pramod2512,"Bengaluru, India",30

haridwar,"On our trip to Uttaranchal, we first visited Haridwar. We had taken this lodge contact details from our relative who had stayed here and frankly it was not a disappointment. We took cycle rickshaw to reach the hotel. But as it was evening time and close to Ganga arati, local police initially denied the rickshaw to move after half way. It was very crowded gali in Haridwar and hence police was right. After we approached the hotel and then they took permission to bring our luggage in rickshaw.   It is budget lodge with few facilities. But the best thing about it, it is very close from Ganga ghats where you can watch Ganga arati, have holy dip in Ganga and watch Ganga flowing very rapidly. Also famous rope-way to Mansa devi temple is very close from lodge. We visited both these",PuneTravelbud,/Profile/PuneTravelbud,Pune,40
