haridwar,"The photos in the TREEBO app when compared to the actual reality was a world apart.   It felt literally like cheating when we reached the hotel, the photos in the TREEBO app were plush and luxurious, but the reality on ground was terrible when compared to the photos.   There were ashrams in the vicinity with better quality and much cheaper prices.   ",sreecanthr,/Profile/sreecanthr,,10
haridwar,"My experience with  Treebo at Haridwar was much below expectation after having stayed at Treebo, Ballupur road Dehradun during January this year. The main reasons were:                                     1. The set up was shabby.                           2. The room service was poor.                   3. The lift was not working.                        4. We left the hotel WITHOUT morning tea/breakfast as the same was delayed. 5. No provision for morning tea in the room.                                                               Kindly improve. ",loknath6666,/Profile/loknath6666,"New Delhi, India",20
haridwar,"I understand Treebo is an international group.. The where I stayed was good at national standards but requires improvement to meet international standards. The hotel at Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh was far better when compared to this one.",Sethurao18,/Profile/Sethurao18,,40
haridwar,The Hotel property does not seems to be a new one. Restaurant is there in the hotel but during my stay it was not operational therefore they had provided food on Payment basis in the room itself. Food charges were reasonable. The room charges were on a higher side for a city like Haridwar may be it was peek reason for them.,T2376manishk,/Profile/T2376manishk,,30
haridwar,Fake hotel false images Worst service. Very small and congested rooms. Exactly opposite as images on internet. Feeling cheated. No one should book this hotel.  Also very slow service. Lunch will take more than one hour.,Rohit P,/Profile/RohitP1381,,10

haridwar,"With the long traffic jams in Haridwar esp near Har ki pauri, the location of this hotel works well if you wish to leave early morning for Rishikesh or beyond as you beat the traffic completely. However, the location works against if you wish to reach Haridwar station. Otherwise, it is a budget property that served good home-style food. The google maps tag is wrong. Parking space is limited. The guy at the reception multi-tasks for room service and other requests.",Y0gee,/Profile/Y0gee,"Mumbai, India",30
haridwar,"Hi guys,  i had stay in this hotel on 26-5-2016. its quite economy in budget. staff is very lazy except 1 on reception , 2 car parking space, 4-5 km far from har ki pauri , bed sheet condition is very very bad. mosquitos are very big and dangerous. rooms are mostly vacant due to this less maintenance. washroom is not well developed water logging problem is there. but if your budget is less than its quite good but recommended please carry mosquito hit with you without this you cann't stay.  Positive point :- hotel is near buy sarvanand ghaat and it was osm place.for kids and adults.",Rajneesh_Tyagi23,/Profile/Rajneesh_Tyagi23,"New Delhi, India",20
haridwar,"Rickshaw had a lot of trouble finding the place. I had pre-booked but it took them a while to  find my booking. A couple of young males seem to be managing the place, however, I don't think they know what they're doing. They tried to be helpful though. Hotel had listed wifi, toiletries, wardrobe etc. None of them were available. Bed looked as if it had been slept in. The whole room looked as though it could do with a thorough clean. The bathroom wasn't in much better shape. Pros: The water was hot and the breakfast was quite good. I paid a fraction more for a much better hotel in Delhi.",loltraveller2013,/Profile/loltraveller2013,"Penrith, Australia",20

haridwar,"I checked in at 12:30 AM and checked out at 9 AM, so there is not much to explore and share. However, some of the points could be of help to fellow travellers.  1. This hotel is in Rishikesh Haridwar. If you have business in that area, then you can definitely consider this hotel.  2. Room size is very good for family 4. The hotel had all basic amenities 5. The wifi of the hotel is not great. I hardly had any connectivity, forget the speed.   6. I had to leave for an early morning meeting and was skipping breakfast. The hotel staff literally pleaded with me to have breakfast. I could not, but was over whelmed by their hospitality.",mksharma2016,/Profile/mksharma2016,"New Delhi, India",50
haridwar,"The hotel was good and clean. The bed and blanket were comfortable and we did not had a sleepless night. The breakfast was good too. The hotel is located on Haridwar-Rishikesh road next to Jairam Ashram 4. It is around 2.5 Kms to 3 Kms away from Har ki Pauri, but as it is located  near the main road getting rickshaws was not a problem, even at 5 AM.",Am-The-Game,/Profile/Am-The-Game,"Singapore, Singapore",50
