haridwar,There are several Dharmshalas in Haridwar where you can stay. But in case if you have no option for Dharmshalas and you have to stay in a Hotel then definitely choose Hotel Sachin International just in front of Haridwar Railway station. The Hotel staff are much courteous and well behaved. You can check in 24 Hours. The facilities are excellent and the staff provide much cooperation to travellers. I strongly recommend to stay in this Hotel. The tariff is affordable and you can negotiate easily according to your need.,GURU PRASAD SINHA,/Profile/GURUSINHA,"Chhapra, India",50

The hotel is outside the restricted traffic area, hence there is no issue wrt traffic in/out. There is sufficient parking too.  The hotel is above average of the regular run-of-the-mill hotels in Haridwar. This was a second choice hotel for us and was upto what we had expected from them.

haridwar,Location - Bang opposite Haridwar railway station.  That is the only good thing about this hotel. We stayed for a few hours. The rooms were clean for a couple of hours stay. But the linen was dirty. The towels were just about okay to use though.  And for the prices they demand the facilities dont match up.  One can still stay if only for a few hours or overnight and if they can cough up the nearly 1000 rupees the folks demand for that.,ribhu95,/Profile/ribhu95,"Bengaluru, India",20
haridwar,"This hotel looks good from outside, but real story is inside. Its location is right next to bus stand and opposite to railway station. So you get all sorts of rickshaw, auto right outside the hotel. However, rooms of the hotel are too small and just sucks. This can not get worse. They have 21 inch old fashioned big box TVs in room. Curtains are torn and dirty. Linen is dirty and towels are something you would avoid using.  They have a restaurant but I doubt they get any visitors their, as it is very poorly maintained. Reception staff needs to be more polite when talking with customers. Just because you are in Haridwar and you get lot of tourist does not mean that you don't need a repeat customer.

I has good location, bang in front of station. The hotel seems to me like it was once a great property but has lost its charm due to age or mis management. Everything is slightly old and diaplated, even towels, taps, beds etc, need a massive makeover.  But I found it OK for people who just want a safe shelter and not too cheap type like some other places near by. But there are 100s of hotels in that area which may be better l think.

haridwar,I stayed in this hotel for a day and I have to say that the room rates are over priced. The only advantage about the hotel is that it is opposite to the Haridwar railway station. I had called the hotel before booking to find out if early check in is possible for which they agreed. Hotel room is not up to the mark. There were lizard droppings in the bath room. As the hotel is just opposite to the station there is  noise and also railway announcements can he heard within the room. The hotel was almost empty when we checked in. Advisable if it is a short stay and if you need to board the train in the wee timings.,Bharath S,/Profile/Bharathstpi,,20
haridwar,"I generally listen to TA reviewers for hotels but deciding to choose Sachin International in spite of the recent bad reviews was a big mistake. My trekking trip was to start from Haridwar and I was to reach at 3am at night and I had to leave by 7 in the morning, my trip organizers suggested me to talk to them for a half day rates. I called them and they assured that they would give me a room for 4 hours and charge accordingly but refused to book over phone and asked me to directly come over and book. I know many hotels do not entertain such policies but they clearly did!  As I reached the hotel at 3 in the night the front office guy straightaway refused for such a deal, he charged me for full day and being in a totally unknown place I was left with no option.

haridwar,"Booked this hotel on the basis of various reviews and its location that is opposite the railway station. Probably the worst choice in our entire 8 day Uttarakhand Trip. The people are fine and the service is good. However listed below are the drawbacks -   1) The rooms are so old and smelly. We felt like just checking out and leaving.  2) We saw rats jumping around in the refuge area in the corridor leading up to our room.  3) When we used the bathroom early morning, we saw rat droppings everywhere.   Obviously they have no aim to provide even basic cleanliness.   There are many other hotels opposite the railway station.

The room is quite cool on its own. Overall, it wasn't a great deal, although the room was spacious.  Just wish they put more effort into cleaning the toilet properly. There were small hairs on the floor, and the flush water was murky brown in color when we used it the first time.

The peak season just finishing (for new year) the rooms were available, and that too at reasonable rates. We got a nice room (not that we had much choice) and they asked for Rs 700/-.
