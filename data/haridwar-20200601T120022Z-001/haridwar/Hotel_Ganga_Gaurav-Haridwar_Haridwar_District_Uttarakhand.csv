haridwar,"It is a very good hotel near Gujranwala bhawan. The rooms are well decorated. Toilet,which is a glass covered area was also well maintained & well equipped. Manager as well as Staffs are very good. They helped me to rent a car for dehradun,mussoorie trip. Food quality was not that good like their rooms & room service. Anytime we are in need of running hot water,they used to switched on the outer switch of geyser. However our trip was fantastic. I stayed there for 3 days... loved and should visit once again",Rohan191287,/Profile/Rohan191287,"Kolkata, India",40
