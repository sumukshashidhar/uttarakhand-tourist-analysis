haridwar,"Worse Experience to stay here..BAD BAD BAD Firstly they show you the room & book the same room take full money in advance. After booking they changed the room to another. If we asked them to provide the same room .They say it was booked earlier by someone else .. We asked them to show the booking from another person ..They don't have record of booking  by anyone. Then they say more price to provide you the same room which they showed at first.. Not commited to what they show & told regarding money matters & other facilities.. Also, Not safe place to stay..",Lokesh k,/Profile/lokeshk01,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",10
haridwar,"Nothing is good about this hotel.. It's dirty, filth everywhere.. Food left overs from previous Guests were seen under the bed in our room. The lights don't work,  geyser doesn't work... It's worse to be precise.. Please people do not stay here and don't go by the few good reviews they have cz i don't believe the authenticity of it.. Hospitality is not in their dictionary..its only about looting money from Guests in every way possible. ",Preksha S,/Profile/ConstantiaCottage,"Kurseong, India",10

haridwar,"We booked this hotel around 10 months prior to our trip to Haridwar for two senior citizens (my parents)  Unfortunately, the management refused to allow us our rooms at the price tat we booked initially. They charged us very high before we checked in. Since my parents were travelling alone, I didnt take any chances and alotted them a separate hotel.  Beware!!! The Management of this Hotel says they are a FRANCHISEE and change quite often. Hence they donot entertain past bookings made by the previous franchisees. They have their own policy of squeezing money out from  customers BOTH Indian and Foreign!  I have been badly tricked by the management of this awful hotel very badly!!! And I will try my level best to make other people aware of their unethical booking policy and",Debjani,/Profile/DebjaniKundu,"Calcutta, West Bengal, India",10
haridwar,The place is good neat and clean esp the big rooms. nearest and best place near Har ki Pauri (1 minute walk). The food is too good. Don't eat outside use the awesome room service.Staff is very helpful. Look for Mr. Sunil who is operations manager.,NoidaSunil,/Profile/NoidaSunil,Noida,50
haridwar,"This place is near the Har ki pauri ( main Ganga ghat). The other hotels near the place is expensive yet not satisfactory. This place is a new one and very economical ( 600 per room double bad with hot geyser/ac). The washrooms are clean and tidy.  Let me summarize it :  Good part:  Location is great. Economical Clean Staff well mannered  Bad part:  Terrible food. Dirty utensils. Small rooms( some washrooms are 'tiny').  If you are really concerned about cleanliness ( very particular), then stay away. The food is not at al good and the utensils used are dirty.  The best thing is that its economical , is at a great location and rooms are clean( but not very clean-  I will give 7/10).",Gautam P,/Profile/GP020,"Ghaziabad, India",30
haridwar,"Bargain on the price as the tariff list shown on the wall is quite pricy. We managed to have almost spotless bedsheets after a 60 minutes wait.Regardless, the staff has been very kind. Our room was missing the main light button (there was a hole on the wall). Watch out getting stuck in the bathroom as our handle was broken.",Matteo P,/Profile/pizzogizmo,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",30

haridwar,"Great place to stay at main har-ki-pauri area. The rooms were clean and the staff was very cooperative. Also the owners were really sweet and offered me a very good price for the room. I would recommend whoever is coming to haridwar to stay here, as the har-ki-pauri ghat and main market is just a 1 min walk from here. The view from my room was a bonus addon to the deal. Keep up the good work!!",anirudhbhola,/Profile/anirudhbhola,,40
haridwar,Very nice place to stay with beautiful clean rooms and superb service. The staff is very friendly. Location is perfect with a lot of good restaurants choices available closeby. Overall recommend it to anyone visiting haridwar !,Cuteshairy,/Profile/Cuteshairy,,50
haridwar,First of all I would like to tell everyone who are reading this review that when you decide to stay in sethi heritage on the bank of river ganga after spending your precious time in looking the rooms and if you want to stay in them just ask for the receipt after you pay because the to beautiful lady's can cancel your preference for the personal profit and force you to stay in dirty rooms in the same cost because your rooms may have booked in higher rates. So plz its from a personal experience and I don't want any one to get affected like us. So plz give your full attention because the to ladies can do anything.. And one thing that money has more priority then you in the eyes üëÄ of those ladies.,Sandeep Y,/Profile/SandeepY135,,10
haridwar,"I visit this place last weekend for a night, it's a small good decent family run hotel.. The usp is its on the bank of ganges and not that noisy too.when you enter two pretty girls walks up to you leaving thier to sets away to greet you. I would like to come back again this place however when I ask for an extra towel they dis approve to give and they need to do something for the seepage on the rooms walls. I stayed in 202 rest I don't knw. This place is Lil overrated but a good place to stay for a night.",Vishal K,/Profile/511vishalk,,40
