haridwar,"We stayed here for a couple of days. Its ideally located near Vishnu ghat, right in the market area, giving very good access to dining, shopping etc. Its around 1-1.5 KM away from Har Ki Pauri, so you can walk for the Aarti in 10 minutes. The rooms were average. Service was insufficient.",Somnath2015,/Profile/Somnath2015,"Greater Noida, India",30
