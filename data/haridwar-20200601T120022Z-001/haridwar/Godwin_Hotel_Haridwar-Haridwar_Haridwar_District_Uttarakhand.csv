haridwar,"Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.  I stay in hotel rooms 30-40 nights out of every year and I have never experienced this before.  This hotel took our money and when our flight was cancelled they kept our money and wouldn't return our phone calls.    We were supposed to stay for three nights but our flight from Udaipur to Dehra Dun was cancelled and there were no trains, buses, or any other way to get to the hotel.  They unapologetically refused to refund our money (I booked through hotels.com) for the nights stay despite it being the off-season and despite the fact that no hotels in India take a deposit.  So they chose to keep one night's fee, and lost my business for two more nights as a consequence....strange way to conduct business.

haridwar,"We were pleasantly surprised by this hotel when we arrived. The reception staff were very friendly and the lobby was clean and inviting. The rooms were very spacious and clean. However, be warned - the hotel website states that they have a spa which is a lie - it doesn't exist!! They do have a nice pool but no changing rooms or facilities (just a load of empty rooms by the pool). The biggest factor of this hotel is that it has been built extremely close to a railway track and every morning at 5 or 6am (and throughout the night) you hear noisy trains with drivers beeping their horns incessantly. Who in their right mind builds a hotel this close to a railway track? It is beyond any reasonable thinking!!!",mermaid88,/Profile/mermaid88,"London, United Kingdom",30

Comfy and brilliantly decorated. The bathrooms are clean and spacious. Located at just a 15 minutes drive from Har-ki-pauri which was comforting. There is also a well kept swimming pool within the premises. The food is delicious and staff is generous enough. However, was really dissapointed to know that the wifi was not operating even though they had promised one on their website. The room service can be better and more lenient. Overall, had a great stay and would definitely recemmond to others visiting Haridwar.",Akshat Jhunjhunwala,/Profile/akshatjjw,"Mumbai, India",40

The rooms were spacious however not the cleanest. The biggest problem was a lack of hot water. I didn't spend much time in the hotel however i did have a comfortable sleep.

haridwar,"I stayed in this hotel las week, 1 night before going to auli and then for 2 nights when we returned from auli.  Rooms are spacious and hotel is quite nice in terms of looks but service was definitely not up to standard.  Housekeeping had to be called repeatedly before tasks were carried out (at one point laundry had not been collected 6 hours later and I had to ask for management to intervene).  At no point was any apology offered. A card in the room stated what toiletry items were available from housekeeping but after calling 3 times and being told it would arrive in 5 minutes I was eventually told the items were not available.  Mini bar in our room was empty on both stays.  On our first stay the room was quite clean but on the second visit, the sheets had stains of on them,",neeru s,/Profile/neerus_12,"Durban, South Africa",20

They showed a room (Premium) which was dusty and was not used for i guess last few months. Then showed another premium room which was smaller, different asthetics, with similar tariff. Room service was Pathetic, i ordered Milk for my Son which came in kettle and when I empted the kettle there were resedues at the bottom, when asked to explain and call Hotel Manager/Chef, they paid no attention and did not even bother to revert. I am uploading the PICS of the Kettle. it could have made my kid sick or even worse...

haridwar,Sweet hotel... lovely grounds and pool.   Monkeys to look at jumping from the roof of the spa to a stone wall.  Restaurant good.  Service friendly and good.  Modern and without personality... but .... no matter.  Only problem with this city is that the nice hotels are situated close to the train track and there are quite a few trains running past at night.  Ganges activities fascinating here.  Rishikesh is 30 minutes away and quieter and prettier.. but maybe no good hotels... ??,yalahabibti,/Profile/yalahabibti,puerto vallarta,40

It would be 3.5-star in my opinion - Good!  The property is very good and impressive, but there are a few basic deficiencies. The first and foremost is that they do not have 24-hours running hot water. They start their boiler early in the morning and so you can get hot water through the morning, but if you want to take an evening shower, you have to ask them to heat the water in their boiler about 15 minutes in advance.  The rooms are nice and comfortable, though they would do well to improve the lighting. The staff is polite, and should improve with experience. The food is nice as well.

haridwar,"I travel to Haridwar on work couple of time a month. Have stayed at Godwin at least half a dozen time. Each time they ask for business card and have to fill in the whole form. Perhaps they do not know about or don't have a frequent guest data base system. The hotel rooms are good, amenities are OK but they are missing a few basics. The lights in the room lobby or over the coffee machines are missing. The full length mirror can not be used due to lack of light. Some bathrooms have shower-stalls, some tubs with half glass or without it. It is impossible to take a shower in the bathrooms with tubs without flooding the bathrooms. Hot water is really on demand, yes,  you need to tell them 15 minutes in advance so that they can raise the boiler temperature.
