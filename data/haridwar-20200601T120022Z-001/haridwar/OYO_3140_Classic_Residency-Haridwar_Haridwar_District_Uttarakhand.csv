haridwar,Opted to stay in this facility for one night after a days tiring travel and works and the experience was just perfect. The room offered was spacious and very nicely laid out with the necessary items keeping in mind the needs of a traveler be it for work or for a tour. Sleep was comfortable and the hotel ambiance was satisfying as per my choice. The breakfast layout was good and was served with fresh cooked food. I had a very limited food for dinner but what I got for my order was satisfying.  A bit away from the hustle and bustle of the main religious center but very conveniently located with local transport options. Will definitely consider this place to stay in the future as well.  The facility offered in the dormitory was found to be satisfactory by my driver and he also had,O2AS,/Profile/O2AS,"Guwahati, India",40
