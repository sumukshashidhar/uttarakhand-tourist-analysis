haridwar,"Could be a beautiful and nice hotel, but is run down and unhealthy to stay. Mattress is moldy and filthy like anything. Walls are moldy. Room stinks of fungus. One must use pollution mask to be able to breathe in the room without caughing and sneezing.   Furniture is dirty as in pig stall. Bathroom door is rotten and has a big 15x15cm hole in it. Bathroom walls have never been cleaned, or if they were once, it must've been in last century some 20 years ago.  Not suitable for humans. Not sure if all rooms are as horrible as the one we experienced, as some guests have given good reviews.",Ossi V,/Profile/Ossi_108,,10
haridwar,"The price is low and the bed can accommodate 3 adults easily.   The room was dirty and the shower was not working. Bedsheets and pillows didn't look great. The phone was not working and the TV had some issues. One of the plug socket was damaged and the room lacked a heater.  If you are not very picky about cleanness and are low on budget,then you can spend one night here.",RAVI P,/Profile/864ravip,,20
haridwar,please don't go to that hotel because this is not a hotel we can call it as garbage house.They could not give a single pillow and bed sheet.we didn't come to know who is waiter and who is receptionalist.They were not receiving a single call.Buckets were lying in the lobby with waste water of AC.In early morning we didn't get sufficient water in washrooms.the photos which we saw on internet of this hotel weren't the same in the hotel.They were no proper locks in the room. The staff members were very irresponsible and they don't know how to behave with guests.  ,sanjay s,/Profile/sanjays649,,10

haridwar,I could managed to visit Haridwar for one day on 12/03/2015 (From 5 am to 11:00 pm) at Hotel Chitra Heritage. Rooms are big and good. Interior is also good.  Wifi services are not so good. Staff members are okay but you cannot say it best services.  For short stay it is okay.,470basantg,/Profile/470basantg,"Anand, India",30
haridwar,"The hotel is quite good with respect to price and locality at Haridwar. When I visited, its restaurant was not functioning but it was accommodated with the help of its sister property located adjacent to it.   The bathroom seems to be designed without logic. As cupboard is right in the middle having basin adjacent to it.  Rest is fine with this hotel, as is just walkable distance from Bus & railway station.",Rohit,/Profile/Rohit780,"Ghaziabad, India",30
haridwar,"This hotel is not up to the expectations. The doors are locked with a lock and key which is such a by gone era. The toilet was very dirty when i checked in. The mirror has all dry water marks, as if not cleaned at all. The toilet was stinking. The door mat was dirty. It was good that i had to stay just for a day. I wouldn't survive there if it were more than a day. The kitchen, if you look at it, you cannot dare to have food in the hotel. Its pathetic. Really I want trip advisor to re-review this hotel which is approved by them.",Aniket_Kshatriya,/Profile/Aniket_Kshatriya,"Mumbai, India",20

haridwar,"First of all, be aware which property you are booking because there are three hotels with 'Chitra' in the title on the same road. We were unlucky and booked the wrong one. As we arrived we were led to our room, where the corridors were lined with buckets collecting water from broken air conditioning units. The room was okay, but the shower didnt work so we went to another room. This room was small and looked nothing like the pictures on the internet. As we were leaving to get a train (the location is the one redeeming factor - very close to the train station) a staff member asked if we had any food. We replied that we had not, and he said he needed to scan our passports again, despite us having them scanned upon check in. He then proceeded to give a random man (not in any hotel",Katy,/Profile/katyr2803,"Plymouth, United Kingdom",10

The Management, The Staff, The Decor, The Interiors EVERYTHING... Trust me EVERYTHING has been changed...  Best part about staying in this hotel is that it is very close to the Bus / Railway station and local transport is easily accesible. Its not very far from the Holy HARKI PAURI, Mansadevi & Chandidevi Temples.  Hotel Also has an Elevator now which makes my folks feel comfortable as they find it hard to climb up the stairs.

haridwar,I had recent trip to haridwar with my family and stayed 3 days at hotel chitra heritage.

haridwar,"First thing this is not a hotel to be with your family. The room sucks , washroom stings, awful smell coming from the bedding's. At night when we turned of the lights we came to notice that the door is not getting fully closed it was bit twisted so any one from the corridor can have a look of our room when lights are on that's what no body is going to like so has to put a piece of cloth their. Worst of the food available on the streets would be better then what they serve in this so called hotel. Staff doesn't understand what we were saying at first few attempts. Only thing in favor of this place is that considering the money you pay for the rooms are big that makes this place a liveable place.",invokin,/Profile/invokin,"Chandigarh, India",20

We had to change our room as Bathroom had water logging in it.   Staff is not trained, loud and unfriendly. There are no lights, rooms not cleaned well, bathroom has broken fittings and had water logging. The sheets were stained and had holes, even after requests it was not changed. Towels provided were like they were not washed after previous use. Mosquitoes were with us for a party. Air conditioner was not working and most light fittings were broken. We asked for a change but were given equally bad room and told a better room will be given in some time which never happened.

There were no lights in the bathroom, broken toilet seat  & spider cobwebs. The makeshift almirah provided had a layer of dust on it.  The worst part was the creaking beds & doors as it was raining heavily outside. In a single night we had 3-4 power cuts.  The staff was not friendly and would ogle unnecessarily. besides all this they charged a hefty 2500 bucks for the room !!!  Never Again !
