Walkable distance from haridwar railway station, budget option for all tourist.",digiyayavar,/Profile/digiyayavar,"New Delhi, India",30
haridwar,Had to visit this place as this was quite close to the railway station and had some parking. The hotel rooms are poorly maintained and we had a visit from a small mice inside our room as well. The rooms aren't all that well maintained. Should only visit this only when you're not left with many options.,gurmukhpanjabi,/Profile/gurmukhpanjabi,"New Delhi, India",30
haridwar,We visited this hotel during our visit to Haridwar in October. The hotel has an added advantage of having some parking space in the basement. The rooms had AC which looked quite old but basic functioning was alright. The rooms were big but requires some  maintenance else it's an alright hotel for a short stay.,NehaPunjabi,/Profile/NehaPunjabi,"New Delhi, India",30
haridwar,"Stayed here during our visit to Haridwar. The rooms are quite old with a whole lot of maintenance required. There was a mice who used to visit our room every now and then as well. The AC looked like it was around 20 years old. The one thing that this hotel scores over other ones is its parking. It has basement parking available for around 6 cars. Overall, it was a very average stay.",bigbeast007,/Profile/bigbeast007,"New Delhi, India",30
haridwar,"Sorry to use that heading but this is what my family, a group of 24 people were treated with. First fall the hotel has no maintenance, rooms are shabby and dirty. Bathrooms are terrible. No wifi and intercom service was available in all rooms tv was just a show piece in all the rooms and room service was rude and pathetic. Biggest problem was 3 out of our 5 rooms were affected with TERMITE, after a long request my rooms were changed.The only season m giving one rating is for the canteen guy he was quick at service and good by nature and he was the only guy handling canteen services. I recommend not to stay in this hotel if your planning for long 2 or 3 nights. ",Ajinkya M,/Profile/243ajinkyam,,10
haridwar,Rooms are clean and services are good. There is some maintenance problem in bathroom and cleanliness of towel and toilet is not up to the mark. Location is very good near to railway station and lot of conveyance is availble for Hari Ki Paudi.,960akhileshm,/Profile/960akhileshm,Pune,40
haridwar,"The hotel room was quite spacious but other basic facilities like Intercom,Television were not working.On inquiry it was told that the hotel was under renovation which seems to be true up to some extent.Maybe after all these things are over it cud be a decent place to stay.Overall behavior of the Manager and staff was very nice and humble.Will only stay after the facilities are OK from the next time",kdarora_castrol,/Profile/kdarora_castrol,"Allahabad, India",30
haridwar,"Average hotel to stay in Haridwar. Infront of the Railway Station and approx 2 km from Har ki Pauri.  Parking space is there.  Rooms are also ok.  Lift is not there, hence can be tough for old people.  Good market area is also nearby. ",Shekharrathore,/Profile/Shekharrathore,"Lucknow, India",30

haridwar,Budget Hotel but located very near to Railway station and Bus stop. Very easy to find location. Toilet is very shabby and rooms are outdated and darty.  Room service is average.  Ideal for early morning transfer to Railway station. Far away from the main market and Ganga. ,Harit Dasgupta,/Profile/dgharit,"Murshidabad, India",30

haridwar,"Well we took 2 rooms for a family Getaway to Haridwar and I must say it was one of the pathetic stay I have ever had, the rooms were dirty the bed-sheet was smelly, we were on the first floor, and the rooms were expensive due to the full season but then therooms were not even clean properly, there were one super deluxe room comprising on two double beds but then it was too much smelly so we had to take two rooms. The location of the hotel is good as it is near to the railway station and some average food joints. I have also stayed in some hotels nearby and recommend do not go for this hotel as there are good hotels on the same lane.",Anil K,/Profile/anilkakkar,"Hapur, India",10
haridwar,"This hotel is very close to railway station, rooms are very big, service also very good. All staff memders are very co operative. We visited here in the month of july 2013. In spite of these things, i want to share those problems also which we found, first- we not get hot water in morning and the driver provided with taxi was very  mannerless.",lkoraj,/Profile/lkoraj,"Lucknow District, India",30
haridwar,"Having been in India for a month now, my standards were not so high, so having to ask for toilet paper (used not so clean roll) and very used towels, was not a surprise.  the staff was friendly, though not many seemed to understand English...  the noise it very loud, as it is near a main road (constant honking) and at 4am staff in the hall were banging doors and talking really loudly.  had a staff member knocking and buzzing to get into my room at 3:30am????   really????  had to say the food i ordered was really good, though..  so, not too clean  or mindful of guests...",peggymch,/Profile/peggymch,"White Rock, Canada",20
haridwar,This is a horrible hotel.  The sheets were dirty on arrival - they did change them when I asked.  The bathroom was dirty and disgusting with a constant dripping.  The window finished before the actual wall and I had to put a rolled up towel in the gap to try to stop the wind blowing in.  They reluctantly gave me an extra blanket.  It was a very unpleasant experience staying here.,R B,/Profile/515RuthB,"London, United Kingdom",10
haridwar,"We stayed for one night because of the convenience having the railway station opposite for an early morning train. The room and bathroom had been dirty, no towels or toiletpaper available, in the bathroom was still a dirty towel from somebody else hanging. The fan was too noisy and the overall impression was poor. Staff was friendly. I would not recommend this hotel.",vedani,/Profile/vedani,munich,20
haridwar,"Hotel is in prime location and hotel staff is also good. Hotel rooms are clean but some are with faulty AC,gieser. So check in and check for working of all necessary things. Ofcourse if you find any fault, ask staff, receptionist will change the room for you. Kitchen staff is also good, but requires little bit follow up for your order some time. Very near to Mansa devi temple andHar-ki-pauri. So worth money( AC room 2+1 at Rs.1000/-). Overall satisfaction is Good.",jaiganjikunta,/Profile/jaiganjikunta,gurgaon,30
