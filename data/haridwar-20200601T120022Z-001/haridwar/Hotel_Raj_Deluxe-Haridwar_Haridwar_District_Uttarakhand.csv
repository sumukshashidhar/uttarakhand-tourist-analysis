haridwar,"I have stayed the one night on the first week of July. Later have booked for three nights. When I cheked in to the room there was no power in the room.  I kept calling people from my room.  No one came even after listening.  When I shouted from the floor as I could see the reception from the balcony where a smart boy was sitting who don't know anything apart from speaking in English. Rather he coming up and meet me,   I being a Hotelier went down to meet him and ask what is the issue.  He directly said you may check out without any apologize. I felt sad as there is no huminity in a holy place like Haridwar. Traveller never stay in this hotel.",gautam287,/Profile/gautam287,mumbai,10
haridwar,"Its a mid budget hotel. The hotel is at very convenient distance from bus stand and har ki paudi. They provide services like wifi, complimentary breakfast. They will also help you to get services for haridwar darshan, site seeing, taxis and travel bookings. Staff was friendly, service was good. Little to be improve on food and cleanliness.",Rohit,/Profile/Rohit304,,40
haridwar,Located near Vishnu ghat and very near to har ki pauri. Ships are nearby which is an added attraction and so do so many restaurants which offer nice food. One can take a walk through these shops to the har ki pauri to watch sandhya aarti which in itself is a refreshing experience.,kinshuk_mukherjee,/Profile/kinshuk_mukherjee,"Ghaziabad, India",50
haridwar,"The location is the single important best part of this hotel. Located in the middle of the market, important places like Har Ki Paudi and Mansa Devi are very close to the hotel. No need to hire any riksha aur anything for reaching to these places from hotel.  Rooms are just  enough to spend nights with good sleep. Hotel staffs are good and will guide you for local information if inquired of. Food is also available in the hotel. Food rates are very reasonable. It tastes good.  For reaching to this hotel from railway station, hire a rikshaw or auto. Rikshaw or auto, both should charge more rupees 50/-. The hotel is in no  big vehicle zone, so you mey need to cover some distance on foot to reach. If you can spend more, try some other hotels.",amitabh_kishore,/Profile/amitabh_kishore,"Visakhapatnam (Vizag), India",30
haridwar,On our way back from Manali we stayed for 5 days there.Mid budget hotel.We were booked with complimentary breakfast.Except Aloo parantha nothing was available. So please do not repete the mistake of booking with breakfast. One of the room given was big but the other room was not. After repeted call the rooms get cleaned. Bed sheets are not changed in three days.Toilet was all right. The bell in the room to call the boys has got no use as even after several bell none appears as they ignore the bell. Overall it was not a pleasant stay.  The only plus point is the location of this is very convenient. All eating houses are just around the corner.Market is away from the main gate. Har ki pauri ghat is just walking distance. Some of the staffs are good.We reached at 6 a.m. Though our,Vishal K,/Profile/689vishalk,"Calcutta, West Bengal, India",30
haridwar,Worst hotel located at a dirty place. I booked AC room. But the AC was not working for the first night. They denied to adjust the AC room charge as according to them it was a mechanical fault. Next day they changed the room. But AC was being off very frequently. Rarely somebody was coming to serve us. Rooms were dirty. Spiders were there inside the electric kettle. Manager had very rude behavior. Nobody should stay in this hotel.,saikat_modak,/Profile/saikat_modak,"Kolkata, India",10
haridwar,"Booked this hotel as holiday home through some Bank's employees association. Rooms are moist, found rat, food and travel desk not checked, windows were not closing properly. Room service boys are very very good and prompt and did their best as expected. Lift available. Har ki pauri 15 minutes walking distance. Bazaar is just a matter of few steps. So if you are looking for a budget hotel and only a shelter is the concern, then may think of this hotel.  For sightseeing purposes you may contact ViswakarmaTour and Travels. They are really best, contact details can be retrieved from justdial.",Soumitava,/Profile/Soumitava,"Kolkata, India",30
