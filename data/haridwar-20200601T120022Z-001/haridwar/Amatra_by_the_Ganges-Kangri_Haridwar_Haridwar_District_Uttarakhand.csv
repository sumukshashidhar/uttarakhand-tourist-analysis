The food was real good and the service also.  Rooms are clean and the staff is very helpful.  The best thing about this hotel is having that breathtaking view of Maa Ganga and it being so calm and serene (no crowd and it’s almost like a private access).  We swam a bit the first we came and it was such a nice experience.   Though the view and the service is good, the food is not that much good now and the change in management meant that some things that were nice like Tea and pakoras around 1600 are not there anymore 😕 .. but nonetheless it is one of the best place and I would be coming again if not just to enjoy the private",Sailesh,/Profile/atmanandb,,40

The hotel is located by the riverside, so the location is quite great on the bank of Ganges. But the way to approach the property is very poor, congested and a rickety one way road. It has a beautiful lawn and an equally good swimming pool. But the rooms are not very good and not upto the mark. Food quality needs major improvement.

But were were unsure about how it would turn out since for the others the pictures had been totally deceptive.  The place is a little difficult to reach since its inside of a little village it seems. So the drive could put you off and may make you wonder where you are headed. But even from a distance the property looks lovely. The entire place is laid with stones and is lush green. The concept of rooms in Villas exist. So the entire villa can be taken or single rooms. The rooms are spacious and have an attached lawn if on the ground floor or have a terrace if on the first floor.

It is a sprawling area and the size of the lawns has to be seen to be believed. There are duplex villas built in clusters. The rooms are clean and toilets spacious. Each villa has three rooms.

haridwar,While the resort is very peaceful and tranquil the service is BAD. Beware of the front office as they have perhaps formed a nexus with travel agents to make an extra buck. We contacted them on21st August to book 08 rooms for 15september and their executive Neha told us that property was under negotiation with a group and that they could confirm by next day only. However she quoted 6500incl breakfast as tariff  On 22nd after several calls she confirmed that the property was sold out as the group which was negotiating had confirmed. With this answer we then contacted a local travel agent who called them and booked 8rooms for 7500 each.  How could this happen if the property was sold out and that too the same day when we were refused booking. We ended up paying 1000extra per room,427vivekb,/Profile/427vivekb,,30

In fact, some of the rooms have Jacuzzi on terrace (probably one category) which is an amazing experience. Overall, I really liked the villa interiors and surrounding area.  - Besides the room, almost all services of a luxury resort are available.

One thing about the room was that the airconditioner was really loud and even on the lowest fan speed it sounded like an airplane (solution is to not use the airconditioner is possible or ask staff for help).

The neighborhood offers a sense of seclusion to the entire setup and complements the overall experience.  The resort itself appeared welcoming with almost a feel of first world countryside, nicely done villas, manicured lawns and recreational facilities offering all the luxury one probably needs to unwind from a hectic city life (at least did the trick for me).

A concept of Villas with three rooms and a sitting room cum library. Even separate rooms are also available. Everything is just too good, decent food, excellent buffet spread, very good service levels, decent behaviour and well kept resort with large lawns, swimming pool etc. Added advantage, it is bang on the banks of river Ganges. Value for money no doubt, and excellent place to visit in large groups specially office get together and family reunions.",VRA12,/Profile/VRA12,"New Delhi, India",50

The rooms are modern , with a lot of glass facade to allow light in, and to view the flower laden trees. The open sit-out with each room is a great place to relax with a mug of beer ( an unusual feature close to Haridwar), watching the sun rise, or set-as the case may be.  Do not hesitate to ask for a table to be laid out in the green expanse. The staff is very helpful .  The pigeons are a pain.

Therefore, if they would have given you a package in their first conversation with you, they will not remember the discussion when they send a confirmation mail to you. In the mail they will quote another package. Secondly, nowhere do they mention that the cost of a villa is more than the cost of the 3 rooms in it.

Serene:  Good location on the water of the Ganges - the banks are clean and untouched... in the pool, one gets a real calm vibe which is great to unwind  Several cons:  1.  Access:  in the evening I was proceeding to the Cigar bar and lounge when I was stopped by the staff as they said it was ""too crowded"" when it clearly did not look it.  Later I found out that the owner was in town with some friends and thus they didn't want outsiders to even enter the bar...
