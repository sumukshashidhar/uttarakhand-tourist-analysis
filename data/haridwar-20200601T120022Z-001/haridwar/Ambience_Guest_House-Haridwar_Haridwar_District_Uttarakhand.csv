haridwar,"Pros:  -The owner of this hotel is very kind and we took a liking to him straight away. He is honest and helpful.  -The room is ok. Comfortable bed and nice balcony. -Good prices  -Good location, off the main road (hence quiet) and a short walk to the main attractions.   Cons: - The room was not all that clean, lots of dust swept under the bed and bathroom not so nice. Very cramped.  - after we checked out we were charged an extra 10% tax that we weren't told about. There was a sign in Hindi but he didn't explain this to us (English speakers). - Lots of noise early in the morning from other guests slamming doors etc. All rooms have an open vent into the corridor so everything is audible.  - This is not the fault of the hotel, but worth mentioning. At 3am somebody came banging on",littlemissgina,/Profile/littlemissgina,"Sydney, Australia",30
