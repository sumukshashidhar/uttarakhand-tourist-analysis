haridwar,"The hotel is centrally located in Haridwar, However, it is in a lane. The hotel is just a two storey simple bldg.  The rooms are basic average with no modern amenities, On arrival for two hours there was no water, complained to the managements several times & the issue was resolved. The taps & basin amenities were completed rusted. Had booked two rooms. Har ki Pauri is 2 km far from this place.  Dinner was provided from the Hotel, which was simple but tasty. Nothing much to expect from the hotel. Just simple & ordinary , had the room serviced before entering, Rooms were clean & neat.   Downstairs (lobby) was always noisy.  The hotel doesn't stand by its name. Nothing as such. Just a bldg in lane & no hill at all.",Rohanarts,/Profile/Rohanarts,"Mumbai, India",30
