haridwar,"We, a family of 3 stayed here in May'18. Located 10 mins by car from Har ki Pauri (Without traffic). Due to road work, we took 1 hr to cover the same distance. Hotel also located 5 mins from Ganga river. Rooms are beautiful, clean and spacious. Had an issue with the hot water in the room. Called up room service at 7:30 am. He told me hot water will come to the taps in the next 20 mins - which did not happen. When I asked him again, he gave me the most stupid excuse ever. He told me 'Abhi tak dhoop (Sunlight) nahi nikla hai'. Now in a cold place like Nainital, we did not face any such issue. Food was tasty with good variety.",ketss,/Profile/ketss,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",40

I went for a wedding function, when I came back to the hotel I asked for a glass of milk for my baby which hotel staff denied to provide me as they said they do not have staff available and kitchen has been closed.

haridwar,"Inspite of good location, the hotel doesn't live upto expectations, I booked rooms through Oyo, and was expecting good service from them, but nothing much was offered by them.  The room are good but bathroom was stinky, even told several times to clean the staff just comes and puts air freshener and doesn't clean it. Staff was not courteous enough and many were rude. They tried to disturb us intentionally during night to take some sort of revenge, as we asked for tea bags which were not in the room and I was expecting it to be there. Towels were also not changed daily, tea was horrible, breakfast just included repetitive menu everyday. I would suggest to book many other better options in Haridwar instead of this .",Vasco Da,/Profile/vascodag2016,"Nairobi, Kenya",20

However, I was disappointed and furious to some extent with the treatment meted out by the reception staff, as  my parents had to wait outside the hotel with luggage while i was completing the registration process. I felt like unimportant and 2nd class customer. My pride and dignity was hurt. I had to carry the luggage myself inside the hotel sensing the situation as nobody was bordered about us.

haridwar,Don't know how to describe but choosing this hotel was the biggest mistake of my life. The worst hotel I have stayed in recent times. The rooms are decent sized and modern but the services of the hotel are pathetic. The receptionist takes forever to pick up the call. You have to ask atleast 5-10 times to get a job done and then after its not sure that the job will be done . We took two super deluxe rooms booked through MakeMyTrip . The coffee maker was included in it. But when we asked for it they refused to provide us . They said they only provide it in executive rooms. I had to argue with the reception guy a lot. He didn't agree. Then I went downstairs from my room and showed him the booking voucher. Then he agreed to give us the coffee maker. Still it took abt 30mins for them,Sushil J,/Profile/SushilJ125,"Ludhiana, India",10
