haridwar,"After we visited the Mansa Devi & Chandi Devi temples through a combined ticket, we were dropped at a central location, which was a 10-minute walk from Moti Bazaar. Shivalik restaurant was the closest & seemed like a decent one, hence we dropped in for late lunch.  They have an extensive menu but most items weren't available. We settled for dosa, idli, south indian thaali & fresh fruit juices. The waiter was lost in thoughts & did not take the order until we reminded. He forgot to bring the thaali & had to be reminded though we were the only family dining at the time. Food was just ok.  There are many other restaurants in the area, this one can be missed.",Soumya Nayak,/Profile/soumyanayak55,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",30
haridwar,"This hotel cum restaurant is on the way to Har ki pauri ghat, on the main road, not very far from railway station 10 minutes walk, we didn't stay at this place but we had our lunch there, we tried their Shivalik Thali which was so good, not too spicy and oily and Masala dosa was good too. That is enough for two persons. 310 rupee (5 Dollars) we paid for our meal.  Thanks Shivalik Hotel ",raju6271,/Profile/raju6271,"Jaipur, India",50
haridwar,"I can speak only about the Shivalik Restaurant. The food was good, served well, hygienic. The comportment of the staff was very homely! Thank #Bhagavan #Vishnu for that. I dislike #Westernized conduct. It just puts me off. Why can't we serve Bharatiya food in a Bharatiya way!? Anyway, I had Aloo ka Paratha, Dahi and Chai - and that was fine. I had pancakes with banana - I was expecting a larger portion for the price - Rs. 300 but that was fine - it tasted good. I had their veg thali too - and it was good too - tasty stuff - daal especially!  I figure the price of the room was good too. I would consider staying here the next time I visit Haridwar, which could be soon. :)",Shashanka Shekhar Panda,/Profile/shashankapanda,"New Delhi, India",50
haridwar,I did not stay there. I visited the Shivalik Restaurant on 5 Jan 2017. The good was delicious. I ate the banana-honey pancake and drank the apple juice. Reasonable food prices. It's close to Haridwar Railway Station.,Rizki Ernawati,/Profile/travelstoriesofrizki,"Jakarta, Indonesia",40
haridwar,"We did not stay and honestly it would be a bit expensive on a budget. But, the restaurant was very good, reasonably priced, and most importantly at the moment, took a credit card. They were very friendly and let us stay a while to use the wifi and relax. If you are having trouble getting money now or just want to use a card, I would highly recommend this place.",rockwed,/Profile/rockwed,"Seattle, Washington",40
