Stuffs behaviour was good and very helpful. Toilet facilities was good basic amenities were there. I suggested this hotel.",joygopal008,/Profile/joygopal008,"New Delhi, India",40
haridwar,stayed there for 4 days with family members. Its average budget hotel but the staff is not very helpful. They will just refuse to provide any kind of assistance. Food is costly. Location is fine and easily accessible.,Saurabh,/Profile/SaurabhK101,"Tirupati, India",30
haridwar,This Hotel is not on HAR ki PAURI. its very far away. I wasted a three night visit here. The services are pathetic. Management is rude and not at all senior citizen friendly. Highly not recommended. Please go for other options.,robin s,/Profile/robin1909,"Mumbai, India",10
haridwar, We booked this hotel for a 1 night stay. The owner / manager is rude and should not be in hospitality. The hotel is far far away from Haridwar. Rooms looked clean but service is lousy.   The owner was rude from the moment we checked in. Did not look at us in the eye. It took an hour to get out room.   After we checked in they turned OFF the air conditioner. But on calling the reception they turned it on. They repeated this electricity saving trick again after a few hours.   We left our keys on the reception and stepped out for the evening Ganga arti. Spent Rs 100 to reach Har ki pauri. When we returned we spent Rs 80 on the Rickshaw. When we walked back into the reception the owner manager saw us enter and pulled out our keys and placed it on the table without even facing us.,Lall,/Profile/Lall,"Dabolim, India",10
haridwar,"Booked two rooms here and stayed with 4 other family members on 30th Sept, 2017.  Cons 1. The allocated room was heavily moist as if it was deprived of sunlight for over a month and closed without any activity. 2. Smelly bed and stained bed-sheet. 3. Washroom was not properly cleaned and the commode contained urine stains as soon as the washroom was checked. 4. The receptionist/attender was always in a hurry and did not listen to what we wanted to order (water/bed-sheet etc.)   5. He denied drinking water to us to be filled in bottle just after our checkout 6. Could seem a little far (3 kms) from Har ki Pauri to some people (was ok for us as we wanted a car parking and uncrowded location)  Pros 1. Parking space in front of Hotel in the street (though not dedicated parking",Devan_Kataria,/Profile/Devan_Kataria,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",20
haridwar,"We booked this hotel looking at the pictures online and I won't lie, I was impressed, as we got the rooms at really low prices.   The hotel has 3 floors, not the huge but it has quite a lot of rooms. There was no lift so it was a little difficult for us as we had 2-3 elderly members as well and climbing up to the 2nd floor was a task for them.    We booked 4 rooms with them, 2 rooms were fine and 2 rooms were smelling terribly. The toilets were in okay condition but the jets of any of the toilets were not working properly even though we complained.   The wifi that they have promised works for 10minutes and gets disconnected on its own. So it was not much of a steal deal.  The beds were fine and the ac worked good as well.  Also, it is a 10minute rickshaw ride from Har-Ki-Pauri. ",Anushka M,/Profile/Getmemorefood,,20
haridwar,"Overall very good hotel to stay.... nit & clean rooms and bathrooms , also has gen-rater for light ... A/C Rooms...and cooperating staff.... good hospitality.... Only 1 drawback of this hotel is ... it is very far from Har ki Bedi.... almost you sent 30-40 Rs for rickshaw for 1 side.... and around 10 to 15 minute to reach ....  and no river or any good view from rooms...  you will see near hotels/temples/Ashram and road from room window...  other wise ... very good hotel to stay at Haridwar....",Akash P,/Profile/83akashp,,40
haridwar,Hotel Lavanya in Haridwar is a hotl which I can recommend to any one without any hesitation. Very decent comfortable rooms with hot and cold water running through 24 hrs. A good veg restaurant. Close to important ghats . A very good front desk with great hospitality.Good interiors too,Sivakumar V,/Profile/sivakumarv2017,"Bengaluru, India",40

haridwar,This hotel is situated a little away from the Har ki paudi area which is the center of haridwar whhere the main temple is situated. The hotel is strictly ok and the staff is decent. We had requested for a extra bedsheet which was initially refused bluntly but subsequently was given which sounded like a favor. The breakfast was nice which had a home cooked feel.,mandar25,/Profile/mandar25,"Mumbai, India",30
haridwar,"If you are choosing this hotel on the basis of pics available online, dont book this specially if you are going with family for a stay.  Avery basic hotel with not all basic amenties available. We booked 2 rooms with 3 bed option but we get 1 room only with 3 bed option as in other room there was problem with AC and toilet.   First impression:- We were welcomed by ants roaming on the spotted linen and housekeeping staff immediately take off the bed sheet. There was no clear picture on any of the LED available on both the rooms. Intercoms are not working and no staff available for room service.  Hotel situated approx 3 km from har ki pauri. No good eateries available in surrounding.   This hotel is only an option if you are looking to sleep and hog on further destination.  This",Vaibhav B,/Profile/vaibyb,"New Delhi, India",20
haridwar,"Hotel lavanya offers good facilities for the amount they charges. Big rooms, Clean Toilets, Friendly staff.  Only thing that I didn't liked was they do net have back for AC in case of a power cut (though Haridwar hardly sees a powercut)  My advice to them is please provide backup for AC too and please upgrade the CRT television to Led. They look awful in your rooms. ",Sumitsagal,/Profile/Sumitsagal,"New Delhi, India",40
haridwar,"I stayed at the hotel this summer. One of the best hotel experiences. The hotel was highly affordable, inspite of being in a good location. It offered the best of the services. The staff's behaviour was cordial. The amenities there were good and the best thing was cleanliness. They really worked hard there to make the stay for us, travellers, comfortable. :) Thanks for the lovely experience.",ankit5765,/Profile/ankit5765,"New Delhi, India",50
haridwar,"Filthy towels, buckets and dirty washrooms... they provided only one towel and that too was soiled. When I requested for a replacement the staff argued that the towel was clean.  The rain water entered the room through closed Windows in the night.  Also service is very very slow.  Will not recommend this hotel at all. We spent just 7 hours.  Around midnight there was hammering on the roof. After 30 minutes when I called they said it could be monkeys. The sound was not that of monkeys. However within 3 minutes of my call the sound stopped. ",Rahul B,/Profile/rahulb818,Gurgaon,10

haridwar,"The room I was in was clean. Once you close the door, it gets quite noiseless. It situated a bit of the roadside, and that helps. Staff is friendly. I just had the breakfast there and the parathas were tasty and felt homemade.  All the electric appliances in the room work, actually. TV reception is blurry, though; something to do with the connection, I'd presume. The bathroom has no exhaust fan but it still didn't feel stuffy.  Overall at this price the hotel also gives you free breakfast. I'd like to stay there again.",Pankaj P,/Profile/422pankajp,,40
haridwar,"I have booked delux room in this hotel for 25 March from a well known web portel. When I reach their they have no clue about my booking but after few minutes of searching & talking to other guy they offered me my room. Room was spacious & had a age old CRT TV. Mirror in room had bad spots. Linen was dirty, even mosquito welcomed us warmly. Room had strange smell thank god my son brought car spray & sprayed it in room when we went out to see Aarti.  We informed about dirty linen & asked to change it but it was chnaged when we came back from aarti.   They gave me room at 3rd floor & there is no lift in hotel so its quite difficult for elderly persons.  Best part of this hotel is location.

haridwar,"We booked hotel during Ardhkumbh Snan. we had a comfortable stay for three days. We arrived hotel at 11.30 PM  and immediately we were offered food and hot tea. Room was excellent, service was very good and laundry was perfect. Next day morning break fast started at 7.30 AM and it tasted well without any problems to stomach. Dinner was also very good. We didn't get the opportunity to taste lunch here. We could see the staff were working as a team and responded well to our questions. Best location near to har ki pauri, easy to find. One should learn from them how to run a hotel. The manager responded quickly to all the email conversations and made us a comfortable stay at Haridwar.

haridwar,"The prime thing I'd like to mention about this hotel is staff and the food. The food was phenomenal and the staff as our family member, a 1-2 Km. away from the Har Ki Pauri.I ordered vegetarian and it was amazing. The staff was courteous and well trained in their job. Parking is not available in the hotel. My stay was more than satisfactory. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.",arjun_p007,/Profile/arjun_p007,"Noida, India",40
haridwar,"I opted for this hotel looking at good TripAdvisor reviews and a good deal I was getting from ClearTrip. I booked 3 rooms for 2 days as I was on a family vacation, and I was expecting to have a good time. My expectations were stun-gunned when I actually checked into the Hotel. All the rooms we got were in filthy condition. The rooms were smelly, and the walls & ceilings were chipped off. The furniture (chairs, cup-boards) were so dirty as if they were never cleaned. There were spider webs all around. The toilets were full of foul smell (no exhaust fan), and most of the fittings were either very dirty or broken. I couldn't dare to use the toilets. The TVs in the room were in bad shape with broken remote controls, and terrible picture quality. The only good thing about the rooms",Amit_Singh_823,/Profile/Amit_Singh_823,New Delhi,10

The rooms were modern neat and clean. The hotel staff showed me couple of rooms to choose from, to suite my choice of decor :) . The bathroom was big and clean.
