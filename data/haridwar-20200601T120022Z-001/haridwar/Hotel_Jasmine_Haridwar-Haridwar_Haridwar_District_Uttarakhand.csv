haridwar,"I was really in doubt where to stay in sidkul as it was a two day stay and commuting from haridwar is always difficult.Surprisingly I found Jasmine and it is like jasmine only very fresh neat and to the point.It actually resembles to boutique hotel.Very clean rooms,great restaurant and nice food and extremly cooperating staff.The boss Mr Karan once dropped me to Rly station due to absence of a cab and allowed me to stay in their another hotel for short duration free of cost.Highly recommended ,cost effective and lovelyb hotel very suited for business travellers.",dipendramathur,/Profile/dipendramathur,,40
haridwar,Not for if you are on pilgrimage / religious visit to Haridwar. It is perfect business hotel. Although you do not get cabs or tuktuk at this place easily. Laundry is served day after tomorrow. Rooms are specious. Misquotes are free of charge. Service is good. Breakfast is good for nothing.,Abhiram_Sathe,/Profile/Abhiram_Sathe,"Pune, India",40
haridwar,"Indeed the cleanliness and the room service deserves appreciation but overall I would say it's not a value for money option. Proximity is a big issue and the people at the counter, the manager or the in-charge had a very rude behaviour although the room service staff was good. The information was not satisfactory when sought for. I agree with one of the reviews which terms it as suffocating. As it has less of the open space or view which gives a kind of congested feeling. To sum up, they perhaps overcharged for the quality of the facilities they provided.",pathakrishabh1,/Profile/pathakrishabh1,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",20
haridwar,The hotel is situated in a lane opposite to Pentagon Mall in SIDCUL a SEZ Special Economic Zone in BHEL township. The staff was courteous The manager and owner were very friendly.  Though it's a small hotel property and it's well managed. The rooms were spacious and clean. This is in industrial area so you don't have opportunity to have a good view from your room.,welcomeumesh,/Profile/welcomeumesh,"New Delhi, India",40
haridwar,Decent value for money hotel. U can stay here with a decent budget and not feel the pinch in your pocket. Haridwar has a lot of interesting and religious places to visit. there are a lot of hotels in haridwar at the same rates,AmitYadav007,/Profile/AmitYadav007,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
haridwar,"I stayed at Hotel Jasmine twice during my visit to SIDCUL, the industrial area in Haridwar.   Pros:  - pick up and drop off to clients (multiple locations within SIDCUL) - Value for money. Not expensive, but no frills either.  - Basic necessities: AC, TV, in-room dining.   Cons:  - Far from Haridwar city. Not exactly a con if your clients are based in SIDCUL",maharajajoe,/Profile/maharajajoe,"Mumbai, India",40
haridwar,First of all I would like to suggest that the property is just good to be called as a Guest house and not a hotel. The property is way out inside the industrial area and can't be approached easily. The only motivation I had that I had a complimentary pick up and drop from my work place. The services were so good that I could not stay more than 2 days. The reason being that the first morning I got up due to sliding windows striking to each other as heavy rainfall in haridwar. Very next morning WET towels were placed in my room that was very disgusting how can a hotel do like that to place wet towels hope they were not used only that time I took the decision to check out this poorly managed GUEST HOUSE.,taruntanz,/Profile/taruntanz,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",20
