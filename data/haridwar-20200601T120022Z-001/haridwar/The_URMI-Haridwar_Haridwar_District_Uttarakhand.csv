haridwar,"I stayed at the Urmi for a day and I have to say that this was over of the most memorable hotel experiences for me.  When you travel to smaller cities like Haridwar, hotels are mostly hit and miss but The Urmi was beyond all expectations.  Our room was large, with a lot of fresh air, and equipped with all modern amenities you expect from a good hotel.  The cleanliness across the property was maintained very well.  One of the highlights of our trip was the food at the restaurant. I've never eaten home cooked Indian food better than this hotel. I would go as far to say that it felt as if I'm actually eating at my own home. Freshly prepared food and vegetables, served straight from the kitchen and the taste was authentic.  Overall, our experience at the Urmi was just amazing and I",Sandeep B,/Profile/447sandeepb,,50

It’s about 3km from train station, but it’s worth its fair price and excellent service (24h hot water, cleaning, towels replacement, drinking water and food to the room just on phone call request) and balcony! Nearby environment is fulfilled with lots of ashrams and it’s easy to get to the calm and silent Ganga from here where almost no people were present. Not too much restaurants nearby (mostly all of them are closer to the center), but if to plan the day right it’s possible to eat pretty tasty food right in the hotel (it’s available only during some hours three times a day, it’s not menu based, so you eat what staff here eats and it’s very tasty).

It has a small terrace next to it which was very useful to soak the winter sun...

It is a very well maintained and decent 2-storey hotel near Bhupatwala. Although it is about half a km inside a lane next to Shantikunj Ashram, the walk down the main road from the hotel to catch an auto is no more uncomfortable as it used to be 2 years back, as the road is carpeted now with paved blocks.  The rooms are spacious and the beds are quite comfortable. One very annoying thing is the absence of a plug socket in the main switchboard on the room entrance or even the sides of the bed. The ONE & ONLY visible plug socket was at floor level below the 21"" TV on the wall right across the bed.

We stayed in winter and it was cold at around 5 deg in the night.  So it was not surprising that the Solar water heating system was not effective.

These staff , though appear ‘simple’ and ‘humble’ are actually pretty smart thieves and steal in such a manner that whenever you reconcile, only then you’d get to know and then assuming ‘may be we only have spent somewhere’.

If you want to go low on cots, high on quality, like home cooked food and last but not the least have your own vehicle to commute, this is the best deal available in Haridwar.  Slightly far away (max 20-30 mins distance from all places) from main attractions but apart from this, amazing experience.

We did not have our vehicle, so faced some issues in terms of traveling to the local places as this hotel is a ;ittle far of from the main Haridwar attractions.

The food, without onion and garlic, was very tasty and well priced.  I appreciate the caring and compassion that the staff showed towards my elderly and physically challenged mother.  She has trouble climbing steps so they made her sit on a chair and carried her inside.  Since the hotel has an elevator we could stay on the first floor without any difficulty.  Our room was clean and well maintained.  The hotel provided our driver with a free dormitory which was really convenient.

haridwar,"We (couple aged 23/24) made a trip through north-india for a month. Therefore, we stayed at a lot of hotels and guesthouses. Usually, I don't like to give recommendations because there were many hotels and they are merely the same (middle-class standard [in India]).  But the Urmi was outstanding, so I would like to recommend this hotel for your trip to Haridwar. We stayed here for three nights. With regard to another comment on ""The Urmi"": Yes, it's hard to find because it's half the way to Rishikesh, but if you ask a driver it's still not difficult to get there. Especially, if you are planning to visit Rishikesh for a short trip (we do so), it is quite easy to get a car or a riksha to get there, because you are already out of the buzzing town.  We were welcomed at 5 o'clock in",Julian K,/Profile/JulianK511,Düsseldorf,50
haridwar,The URMI is very nice hotel in a very reasonable price. The hotel is clean and has well furnished rooms (at least the ones in which I stayed were nice). The staff is helping and the restaurant downstairs provides hygienic food. It's about half a kilometer away from main road and Shantikunj ashram is walkable. The only drawback is hot water.

But on my 6th time, I was accompanied by my wife, my 3 year old daughter and my parents in law. I can only explian the kind of care, hospitality, warmth and service through the words of my daughter who always told her mother to take her to ghar (hotel room) as the rooms and food and the care for this 3year old was similar to the one she relishes back at her home.
