haridwar,Booked this oyo for stay for night. Check in experience was worst. They were rude and talked like as if we were beggers. They denied booking at first saying don't have a three sharing room and hotel is over booked oyo. This is when we pre paid everything in advance that to rs 3100 . After arguing for 20 mins or so we were given a room.  Now about the room linens were all dirty they even denied to change it saying they don't have extra bedsheets.  We had to check out by 8:30 am and breakfast was not provided because there kitchen start at 9:00 am.  My suggestion would be please don't book oyo now.  There use be a time when oyo's were great now. These are the worst hotels you can book.  Ya one more thing this property is PREMIUM on OYO APP. SO NOW U CAN IMAGE OYO STANDARD NOWADAYS.,GoPlaces63622125205,/Profile/GoPlaces63622125205,,10
