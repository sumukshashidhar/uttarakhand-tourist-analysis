haridwar,A good budget hotel with excellent food. The rooms are old though and the carpets etc need to be refurbished. The staff is very prompt and very open to specific request for children food etc. Decent parking space available though the street leading to it can get crowded in peak hours.,Neha A,/Profile/NehaA381,,40

haridwar,"Built in 1975/6, the building still retains a class and charm of days gone by. Hotel is set back from main road so it is quiet and streets not so dusty. Staff were very helpful in getting the internet functioning. However the rooms are in desperate need of a lick of paint and new bed linens are several years overdue! Bathrooms are  clean with hot water. Location is good with great street food everywhere. A little attention to maintenance would make much more pleasant and  good value for money.",bjbrowne123,/Profile/bjbrowne123,United Kingdom,30

haridwar,A very good hotel to stay nearby Har ki Paudi which is just 1.5 km away. Hotel rooms and premises were properly cleaned. The hotel staff persons were well dressed and polite. Food quality in restaurant was good and room service was also good. Hotel receptionist was very cooperative as he provided me google location of hotel prior to check-in. Only negative point is the location of hotel which is situated at crowded location and I felt little difficulty in reaching to the hotel.,Sunil D,/Profile/668sunild,,40

Food quality was also very good. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and everyone :) cheers,Sirjeevan S,/Profile/Sirjeevan,"New Delhi, India",40
haridwar,"Hotel Suvidha Deluxe is near to railway station and bus stand behind Chitra talkies. It is amidst of many hotels. Nevertheless, the facade and lobby area is well maintained.  Room which was offered to me was clean and tidy.  Pros- Clean and tidy room Nice location near to railway station   Cons- Unmaintained room Many flaws in room where bathroom fitting and main room door lock was broken.",kapil_sagi,/Profile/kapil_sagi,"Agra, India",30
haridwar,I was travelling from Delhi to Haridwar and my Taxi driver suggested me this hotel. There are multiple hotels and Ashram in Hardiwar and hence it becomes very difficult to select the right one.  Pros of the hotel - In house Restaurant (Very Good Food) - Nice and Friendly People ( Do not overcharge in the name of commission for booking cabs and tourist buses) - Decent Rooms  - Near to Maya Devi Bus stand ( you can catch rishikesh tourist bus from here )  Cons - Slightly far away from har ki pauri (Ganga Ghat) - You will have to take an auto (20 Rs / Person) - Slightly costlier compared to other hotels  Would recommend if you are planning to stay for a couple of days and doesnt mind shelling couple of hundreds for comfort,LordHarbringer,/Profile/LordHarbringer,"Navi Mumbai, India",40
haridwar,"Dont search anywhere,just come here, its a budget hotel with so cooperative snd friendly staff,nice food, neat and clean here, thnks a lot hotel suvidha for your so much nice approach.

haridwar,"I'm fullllllly satisfied by the room given to me by suvidha guys. I stayed in 3 different hotels in 3 days in haridwar n rishikesh....this was best..others waste of money. Hotel is very close to haridwar railway station walking distance of 8-10 min. And morning walk is awesome har Ki paudi is abt 1.5 km u can just go by walking along ganga. When I reached hotel staff is positive and friendly u ll  feel like some good vibes and the room 402 ahh... relaxing ,beautiful . I will not tell u the price I paid but I completely enjoyed the stay here ...  Disclaimer.... I must try others as well, may be next time something more astonishing  Suggestion..... Keep Searching!!!!! ",Devesh A,/Profile/devesha2015,,40
haridwar,"We were brought to this hotel by a 'dalal' as hadn't had much time to explore hotels in Haridwar. Neither was this hotel situated at a good location(was far away from Har Ki Paudi), nor was it cheap(we paid 2300 for 2 rooms, after much negotiation). The rooms were dirty, the geyser was not operational(they only supplied hot water in the morning), the service was average, and the staff shut down the fridge in our room without any intimation. We had a one-year-old kid with us and faced problems managing things because of these factors.  Thankfully, they had a lift installed, but we found the hotel too costly for the services it provided. Not worth staying at all - Avoid it !",Varun Mutreja,/Profile/Varun_Mutreja,"New Delhi, India",20
haridwar,Nice Hotel in Haridwar near Railway station and Har-Ki-Pauri. Great Service and good staff. The Rooms are well with all required facilities. The Toilets are good and lift facility is good but the light facility is not ok. Overall ok. good,A Tripadvisor Member,/Profile/null,"Haridwar, India",30
haridwar,The room as well as bathroom was very dirty. there was no geyser. Phone was not working. Food was also very bad and it was difficult to eat that food. Staff was rude. No improvements made despite complaints. They did not provide even soap and towels in deluxe room. I would never think of this hotel again.,DelhiAmit_D,/Profile/DelhiAmit_D,Delhi,10
haridwar,The hotel rooms are dirty. Rats were moving here and there and one of them got into my shoe.Condition of toilet was horrible. The geyser was not working. The behavior of staff was very bad. We had to wait for 30 minutes just to check in. Even we had to carry our own luggage in and out of the hotel. The room tariff was too high and the rooms were not of deluxe standard.Apart from the location( Close to the railway station) everything was bad for this hotel.,drNilanjan,/Profile/drNilanjan,Kolkata,10
