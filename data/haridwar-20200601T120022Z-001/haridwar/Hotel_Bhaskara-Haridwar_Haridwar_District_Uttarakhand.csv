haridwar,"I stayed for a night with my friends. AC was not cooling properly. Also AC will shut down on power backup. Even charging points were not working on power back up /generator. Next morning there was no power and no backup. Room was noisy as it is right on main road. Room service is available but no intercom phone.  Pros -  Very close to station, Parking available and friendly staff. ",nitin p,/Profile/831nitinp,,20
haridwar,"Only advantage of this hotel is its location which is opposite to railway station. Nothing else is nice about this hotel. I stayed in this hotel for few hours while waiting for a train  to Delhi. Air conditioner is preset and will never get the coolness you desire. Staff is unfriendly and non supportive. Rooms are not clean,There are many other hotels which are few feet away , better explore those instead of this. There is a lane right behind this hotel where there are large number of hotel room options.",sri2016102,/Profile/sri2016102,"Hyderabad, India",10
