haridwar,We were in 4 bed room. But we didn't received satisfactory service. They didn't provided WiFi. When we asked them that they are rated for WiFi by TripAdvisor but they said they we don't provide. Actually there was WiFi but they refused to give the password and excused that their WiFi is not working. Room was good but there was not enough space to walk in the room. Most of the room was covered with the bed. ,Harrnish R,/Profile/HarrnishR,"Ahmedabad, India",20
haridwar,"The guest house is very close to the railway station, close to 170 meters.   Though the room was a bit small, it was clean. Bedspreads were clean and the bathroom clean too.  Room is quite with no disturbance from outside whatsoever. There are many eateries nearby. The guesthouse has facility of railway ticket booking and other quick tours.",manchuray,/Profile/manchuray,"Bengaluru, India",50
