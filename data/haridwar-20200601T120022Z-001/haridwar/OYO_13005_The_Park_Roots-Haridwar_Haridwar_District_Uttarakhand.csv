haridwar,It was a very pleasant and comfortable stay. Me n my friend were there for 4 nights. We did not get to eat any meals but the stay for 2 ladies was made safe. Shekhar and Sourabh specially attended to all our requests with a smile and seemed genuinely willing to help. The room though small was clean and self sufficient. Thank you,Kavitha A,/Profile/KavithaD261,,50
