haridwar,"I really like this place and I'll stay again next time I'm in Haridwar. The room was pretty comfortable, but there was nothing fancy about it. The manager is exceptionally friendly and helpful. I didn't have anything to eat there, but the restaurant does have a nice view of Ganga.The one thing I could complain of is that there was a little green mold in some places, which I felt they could have dealt with better. This was just after the monsoon, so fortunately it wasn't worse. There is wifi in the restaurant and adjacent rooms, but not in the ghat-level rooms.",Peregrineri,/Profile/Peregrineri,"New Delhi, India",40
haridwar,Very good staff...It's a heritage hotel so gives u a vintage feel... It is at Ganga ghat....So u don't have to go anywhere...U can dip in Ganga here only... It is in main market area so easy to move around city,Chinmaya S,/Profile/ChinmayaS32,,40
haridwar,"This is a nice hotel, with nice rooms and nice bathroom/shower...probably the best shower I had my whole time in India. We had a little balcony that went right out to The Ganges, and if you request one of the lower level rooms you can actually dip in The Ganges straight from your room! That was not for us... but maybe for you.   When we first arrived in Haridwar we were a little concerned, we saw the most poverty we had seen since arriving in India. But, The Ganges is a meeting spot for people of all walks of life on holy missions and I think that's to be expected. Needless to say we passed by a lot of suspect looking hotels, so when we arrived at Center Point we were very pleased.   Despite the conditions of the town upon arrival I would definitely recommend coming to Haridwar.",Michele_Zanetti,/Profile/Michele_Zanetti,"Brooklyn, New York",40
haridwar,I did booking for this hotel through booking.com.  I confirmed reservations 2 days before but on the day of arrival they said no rooms were available. I did booking as this had a private ghat. The owners don't seem to trust booking through Internet. ,manojravikanti21,/Profile/manojravikanti21,"Bengaluru, India",20
haridwar,"my agent booked the hotel for me. Mr Goswamy confirmed the bookings on ground floor as my mother cant walk.He told us in advance that rooms on first floor are bad. when we reached the hotel, all rooms were on first floor. i decided to cancel the rooms and get the refund. the manager refused to refund. Thanks to travellers who were staying on ground floor. They vacated the rooms after two hours and i could accomodate my mother on ground floor. so they are liars. Secondly, we kept waiting for dinner in restaurant but nobody came to take the order. later they told us that cook was not well..sucha bad excuse.we took all the meals at a dhaba nearby. rooms were very basic.lcd only on ground floor.ants and spiders in the rooms took great care of us.it was a pilgrimage but we killed so",manish p,/Profile/drmanishpahuja,"Faridabad, India",10
haridwar,"1. Hotel Centre point is right on the ganga river! they have their private ghat where you can take a bath in the holy ganges and without the hustle and bustle of a regular bathing ghat, that eliminates problem of change of clothes once you take a dip in the holy ganges. You can just change the clothes in your room!.  2. Since the hotel is in the water, the room smells of mold and have an ancient feel to them. Also the food quality is not good.we ate aloo parantha and it had no taste!",devbhoomi_yatri,/Profile/devbhoomi_yatri,"Allentown, Pennsylvania",40
haridwar,"This hotel is located on the banks of Ganga. It has very friendly staff and good food. It is a budget hotel well worth the money spent. It can be easily approached. Of course for people with own vehicles, parking may be an issue. It has its own private bathing ghat which is really wonderful.",Ravi C,/Profile/taataravi65,"Bengaluru, India",40
haridwar,"One of the awesome stay in Haridwar. Walking distance from Holy Ghats and Mansa Devi. Rooms are awesome with all the ameities. They have private ghat from where you can take bath and the view are really awesome and it can't be expressed in words, however, they have to work on their food as they have limited items to serve. Overall awesome hotel with an evey opening and excellent view.",vicky_29in,/Profile/vicky_29in,,40
