haridwar,"After recommendation from a friend we opt for lajja palace(their's board is of lajja palace).although its a clean hotel but the reception manager is so rude and waiter tooo.rooms were on triple occupancy each and charged for the same but denied to give towels for same no persons as they have rule for 1 towel to each room.never seen kind of police anywhere. 2 point is if you wish to bring packed meal from market they refuses to give plates and bowls for meal as if u take order from our restaurant then from where we will earn for restaurant and how will  pay salary to our staff......they have their own policy.never seen such type of property,and hotel staff and manager...not ever ever recommend to any one...the only positive point is that is in main market thats it...pls dont ever",Nehaa89,/Profile/Nehaa89,"Udaipur, India",10
