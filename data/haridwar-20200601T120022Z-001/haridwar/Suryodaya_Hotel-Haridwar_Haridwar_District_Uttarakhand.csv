haridwar,"I don't think anyone have to read the review details after reading the subject line. It is worst hotel ever I have stayed. We were 3 families booked 3 rooms and everybody has the same bad feeling. We booked 3 rooms for 2 days @ 9800 which is not daam cheap too.  Their hotel is full of bug and anybody need to run to hospital after spending 1 night there. we were sick too. Only the location was good and nothing else. Though their ganges facing rooms are so terrible to spoil your entire trip. Best of luck if you still book this hotel after reading this review.  Terrible Hotel, Dirty rooms, Bugs everywhere, No Gyser, Bad behavior of manager, Your belonging can be stolen, Good Location but I wod rather stay at road.",Prosenjit,/Profile/Ghosh_Prosenjit,"Kolkata, India",10
haridwar,"The good point of this hotel is, it is bang on the ganga ghat. Though the hotel is an average one where you can find some cleaning issues. Otherwise, a good one for its service. Vehicles don't move in lane of the hotel, so big vehicles are not allowed.",amitkumar_bec,/Profile/amitkumar_bec,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
haridwar,"Dirty, badly maintained, not cleaned, unresponsive to guests, boring food, worst manager ever. I think will run out of adjectives staying for this hotel We were three people who stayed three nights and we had to as we had booked online. The hotel employees, one person who was the most efficient, actually told us never to come back to the hotel. All agree that the manager was the worst thing to have happened to it. He also told us not to book online as they extracted the discount through poor service and behaviour.  We had gone in Feb, off season, and we could have got many hotels, cheaper and definitely cleaner and with some semblance of service. The rooms were so dirty that you could see dark rings around furniture, which too were broken. Everything in the bathroom was dripping",Paroms,/Profile/Paroms,"New Delhi, India",10

haridwar,"We stayed here for 1 night in Oct 1st week. Awesome location, though it is slightly tricky. The main gate of the hotel is about 1.5 km from Hari ki paudi. Though, there is a catch, the hotel has a door opening right at the ghat (150 meters from hari ki Paudi). The timings for this door are 0600 hrs to 2100 hrs.   Check in was smooth, porter is available. Rooms are very basis but clean (though the front office Manager gave us Ganga facing room which was a plus). We had the booking on 'room only' basis so can't comment about the food.   Washroom was clean with hot water facility. Our overall stay was pleasant.",Pushpanjali D,/Profile/pushpanjalid2017,"Chandigarh, India",30

haridwar,Had two rooms for family and my family came back with a bad experience at the hotel.  - Damp Rooms - Bad service quality - Cleanliness an issue - Toiletries are bad - Didn't even give a towel to the third guest in the room (paid for and pre- informed) - No parking at the hotel premises (we knew about it beforehand though)  Overall a really ordinary experience.

haridwar,The room which was promised to us was never given.  The one given was similar to it but in a pathetic condition  When enquired why is our room so poorly conditioned he mentioned the actual room allotted to you has been taken by someone else.  When asked him to show his register he did and also showed his system software not realising we are hoteliers and caught his fraud and lie in less than 40 seconds.  The guy at reception is rude  I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone. ,ajay b,/Profile/ajayb2804,"Mumbai, India",10
haridwar,Booked this hotel online. Only positive is its location which is very near to Har Ki Pauri. 3-4 mins walking distance only. Otherwise this hotel cannot provide you satisfactory service. Rooms are not clean. Blankets are also not clean. Room service is very poor. They don't even have enough towels. Will not recommend anyone to stay here. Better to stay in good hotel may not be near to Har Ki Pauri. ,AnandG1982,/Profile/AnandG1982,"New Delhi, India",20

haridwar,"Suryodaya Hotel is located very close to Har Ki Pauri in Haridwar and I would say is one of the better hotels in this place. Hotel staff is courteous, rooms are spacious to accommodate 2 person. Bathrooms are not maintained clean and the management needs to put in a big effort to correct this. Bed and room upholstery is just ok. Towels were clean but the room overall cleanliness needs to be uplifted. Do not rely on room service except for water and tea. Restaurant staff is very reluctant to offer room service. There are good places close by to eat (like Jain Chat Bhandar, Mohanji Pooriwale etc). Though the hotel is very closely located to highway, it’s on the other bank of Ganges, so you need to walk a bit to reach the hotel from parking lot and also vehicles are not allowed",GuruPrasad80,/Profile/GuruPrasad80,"Bengaluru, India",30
haridwar,"We stayed in 2 rooms of 500 series . Check-in was literally rough. The desk person refused to acknowledge that we actually had room bookings. Anyhow after enough reference and providing receipts, we checked in to our rooms.  * Floor cleaning was good but the bedsheets had permanent stains. * When u r at a hotel, u certainly don't want to ToucH the dustbin while throwing trash. The pedal of the dustbin was broken. We asked the attendant twice to change it, but in vain.  * And they have a not so lovely washing system in the commodes: some sort of handy water gun. Who does that dude?  * The other room's bedsheet was  decorated with an insect cocoon. This clearly means that the bedsheets were not changed and pest control was not done . * I don't know about many others of this",SSimar C,/Profile/S_Simar_India,,30

haridwar,"Hotel Suryodaya is located just a little walk away from Har Ki Pauri ghat. Location therefore is the best thing about the hotel. The other side of the hotel is ganga facing and being adjacent to the ghat, it gives a beautiful view. Since it is away from the main crowd of  har ki pauri region, it allows you to enjoy the ghat and water peacefully. Walking a bit you will find yourself in Har  ki pauri. The evening aarti starts at 6 so you can go by 5:30 or even 5 to get the best view.  The hotel and the  rooms are spacious, making our stay comfortable. The rooms have Acs and geysers which were very much needed. The ganga facing rooms have no balcony but windows.

The problem with the hotel is the swifness of service. Since the hotels in haridwar are always service quality on almost all hotels in Haridwar is casual.

The rooms are pretty big and clean. Though the tariff may vary and one needs to bargain heavily to get his value for money. But the variability of prices seems to be a common issue in all mid-range hotels here. The biggest plus of the hotel is the location which is right there on the ghat. In fact from any ground flour room you can get a feel of the ghat or just a minute walk and you are right in the middle of the most happening place.
