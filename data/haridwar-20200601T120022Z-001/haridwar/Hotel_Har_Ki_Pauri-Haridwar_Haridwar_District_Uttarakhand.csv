haridwar,This is a good hotel in Haridwar. The hotel is located very close to har ki pauri ghat. the walking distance to the ghat is less than 1 min. You need to cross the road and the Ganges is there waiting for you. Rooms are spacious. We booked 3 AC rooms. The hotel Manager Mr Gaurav Nagpal was too good. He tried his best to get to his hotel from the station. He is too polite. And very much helpful. The service is very good. We ordered food from there too. And it was hot and well cooked.

haridwar,Just minutes away from Har Ki Pauri .. that is the attraction of this hotel. However the disadvantage is that no vehicles are allowed entry to Har Ki Pauri which means you have to either come here by cycle-rickshaw or if you come to the hotel by auto it goes around the other bank of the Ganges to approach the hotel which is costly ... average hotel in terms of rooms and service.

haridwar,I had chosen this hotel based on its location and reviews. The HKP ghat is just 50 metres east and the location in a quiet part is a boon alongside the view. The rooms (semi deluxe at around Rs 1500) is ok. Food is available and is However I would suggest that the owners attend to a few aspects to enhance the experience.  The geyser switches are common to certain rooms.. this is an absurd proposition when families are not involved. The AC switch to our room on first floor was located at the recption .. and everythime we had to contact them ! The fixtures were bad and often the fan regulator or the AC grid would come loose on our hands. This is very very avoidable. The hotel entrance too could be lit up better (like the ones around) and spruced up.. the ramped approach was not,Indrani D,/Profile/papai2013,"Kolkata, India",30
haridwar,It is a good place to stay for a brief transit in Haridwar. I stayed for a night. The rooms are clean but bit smaller with respect to the prices charged. The 3rd floor rooms offer you good views to Ganges but you will miss one balcony dearly. The biggest advantage of staying here is the proximity with the Hari Ki Pauri ghat. The service is ok.

Staff is friendly, food is quite amazing, well cleaned room and homely environment makes it a perfect place to stay with your family. Most important thing, Holy Ganga is just across the road and is on the walking distance from the hotel. You can see the Holy Ganga from the window of your room. It gives you divine feeling while seeing Holy Ganga from your room. I will come back and stay at this hotel again when I would visit there next time.

The hotel has two kinds of rooms as far as the view is concerned - some face the ghats and some away. The ones facing the ghats are more expensive. In my opinion, the nearness and easy accessibility to the actual ghats makes paying paying extra for the view kind of futile.  The rooms are quite large and decent. They are generally clean.
