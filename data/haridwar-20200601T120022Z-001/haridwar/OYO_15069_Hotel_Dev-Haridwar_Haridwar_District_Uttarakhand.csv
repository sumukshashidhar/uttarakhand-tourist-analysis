haridwar,"Worst hotel ever, I visited with my partner recently around the mid-February along with my partner. We made the booking via OYO app, but when we finally reach thereafter great struggle the manager refused to consider online payment through OYO, while they are the official partner of OYO Hotels.  As per him, this hotel accepts only cash payment, no matter you are booking it from OYO site. He behaved very badly.  Over an above of it, the other misfortune happened that my wallet was stolen at the railway station itself.  To my bad luck, the hotel is little away from the main city, we had no other option left but to pay in cash and take accommodation for a night. It was a complete nightmare getting the worst response from staffs and Manager as well.  To top it up was super dirty",dipali,/Profile/dipalis68,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",10

haridwar,"I stayed for a few days in this hotel behind Patanjali Yogpeeth. Staying at this hotel is not as great anymore. This hotel also has its own Restaurant, Whose food was not of good quality. So overall, I call it an average hotel.",Aman K,/Profile/AmanK1045,"Kanpur, India",30
haridwar,"Situated just opposite to Patanjali Yogpeeth-1, this hotel also has a restaurant of their own. They have a family suite as well apart from double bed occupancy. Two major drawbacks I found was- No geyser in bathroom, WiFi range is limited to ground floor only. Apart from these drawbacks, our family suite was decent, properly cleaned along with a balcony. Restaurant was too decent and prices were reasonable.",Harshit Anand,/Profile/harshit_anand,"Ranchi, India",40
haridwar,"I had opportunity to use its restaurant one evening near Patanjali Yog Peeth. Its not a hotel like. Only restaurant had deserted look when we entered. Still we decided to try. The service was pathetic. No napkins, no tissue paper unless asked, food was served late, staffs were dirty non-uniformed one.The waiter did not replenish curry which he accidently removed, even after requesting him and manager. Do not try french-fry, which was like cheap potatoes sliced thin and shallow fried. The hotel did not provide bill also.  If the attitude of staff is rude, the so called hotel must be abhorable. Avoid it.",KiranRajSing,/Profile/KiranRajSing,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",10

haridwar,"Hotel is 16 km away from railway station. The staff are co-operative but lacks in service. Washrooms are dirty and tv had no remote and not staff cared about it. Nearby there is no hotels, just a local dhaba which also closes by 10 pm. Not recommended for family stay.",अमित श,/Profile/M1226AM_,"New Delhi, India",20

haridwar,"when I came there, they put me in a room, which was not dirty, it was disgusting! the brown was literally coming out of the toilette, I'm not joking. After I complained they 'cleaned the room' but still it was disgusting,so I decided to leave. I didn't get my money back and the guys at cleartrip said, they could not help me, because I called too late. But I wasn't able to call in a situation in the hotel with people being angry at me and sending me away. I will never book a hotel in advance any more, at least not with cleartrip!                     ",Fabian K,/Profile/393fabiank,Mumbai,10
haridwar,"name of the hotel is hotel dev haridwar, so anybody would think it is in haridwar but it is 18kms far from haridwar railway station, there are two patanjali yogpeeths in haridwar this one is in  roorkee...so please before booking see the location 10 times because nobody entertains your complaints afterwards....auto charges 300 bucks from railway station and the room rent is 400...imagine how would you feel when you get down from the train and then come to know that your hotel is actually far away...lol didnt even checked in the hotel but still had to shell out all the money because its their stupid policy",ssc,/Profile/ssc86,"Pune, India",10
