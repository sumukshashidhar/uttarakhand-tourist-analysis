haridwar,Visited Haridwar with my mother. I wanted my mother to had a great time at haridwar and thanks to Bonjour Hotels And Resorts for organizing our trip so well. My mothers sat at Private Ghat for hours and enjoyed the sound of Ganga River. Overall it was a pleasant stay.,Siddharth T,/Profile/SiddharthT99,,50
haridwar,"Had booked the hotel to keep the luggage only as had reached late in the evening and had a train at 10;30pm same day. At the time of check/in I had clearly mentioned that my Mother and her sister would come to stay for an hour and then we would check out . The lady at the reception agreed for the same. At 9pm when my mother & her sister aged 63 & 62 YO respectively came to rest and eventually pick up the luggage and leave the lady (owner) very rudely got personal and questioned us about our upbringing and how we couldn‚Äôt afford two rooms if there were four guests coming in. She shouted I front of everyone on us .  Would request you to check the CCTV camera if you think this is a vague comment.  If that was the case, then we should have been informed at check in. It‚Äôs not like I",Mahima S,/Profile/MahimaS102,"Mumbai, India",10
haridwar,"5 star for the View üëç  Wow.. Loved our stay at Anand Niketan By Bonjour, Haridwar. Visited it with my friends. Watching Ganges River Flowing from our window was so peaceful sight. Must recommended hotel if you love River View.",Destination759255,/Profile/Destination759255,,50
haridwar,Stayed here for 02 nights and my family loved the location and view of the hotel.. It is right on the ganges. View from our room was beautiful.   Go for Ganga Facing Room. My family had a great time here.,Ashish Rana,/Profile/ashishrana32472,,50
haridwar,"First of all, I may like to clarify 'Bonjour' as mentioned in the name 'Anand Niketan By Bonjour' has nothing to do with the hotel and this name is not utilised  even by the hotel. The hotel is just 700-800 meter away from Har Ki Pauri but lack adequate and trained staff. It is nothing more than a rest house as no quality of a hotel is available there.",Kumar M,/Profile/writetokmanoj,"New Delhi, India",30
haridwar,"We got conned into Goibibo recommending this property as a 3 star hotel with fascinating Ganga facing rooms. Yes we did get the Ganga facing room, but that's the end of anything good about this property. No full time manager, no properly trained staff. The restaurant opens at 8 am. Please dont pay for free breakfast because they have nothing except aloo parantha and curd to offer. Kitchen is poorly maintained. wifi was under repair for the two nights we stayed. Over priced- we paid Rs. 8562 for 2 nights for triple occupancy. Stay away!",Sangam T,/Profile/sangamt2017,"New Delhi, India",30
haridwar,"Haridwar is a fascinating place to visit and well worth spending several days exploring. While this hotel is in a great location looking over Ganga River this did not meet our expectations and the service and cleanliness left a lot to be desired. The restaurant was really dirty,  Wifi was poor and only worked in lobby, and we had major issues in trying to pay by card, eventually having to walk around to find an ATM (that worked) for cash with an exceptionally rude member of staff that treated a rickshaw that gave us a ride appallingly. This was overpriced and we would not recommend it at all, with many other hotels around that might not be on the river but treat guests well.",mark10r,/Profile/mark10r,"Barwon Heads, Australia",20
haridwar,"Dear Guest,  Its a humble request to each and every guest to book directly,pay directly to hotel Anand Niketan instead of booking from TREEBO. As i have heard from anand niketan staff that TREEBO have not paid a single amount to Anand Niketan hotel which were collected huge amount from the guest.

haridwar,Pathetic hotel. No maintenance of the rooms. They are overcharging. Charging more than Rs 4000 for a room that is worth not more than Rs 1000. I was shifted from Treebo Vibhav Marriot to this hotel called Treebo Anand Niketan. Not at all same standards.,Sumeet K,/Profile/501sumeetk,,10
haridwar,I had my confirmed booking in this hotel for 29 apr-18 - 1 may-2018.  When i checked in treebo on 29 april at 8: 15 am which was I aware of the stipulated check in time of 11 am . I told them I will be back by 5 pm on 29 april  after placing my luggage at reception. When I checked in at  5:15 PM these buggers told me that they don't have any room for my confirm booking. These people are running a racket of befooling people . Treebo is the worst hotel chain  which I encountered in hospitality industry  ABHISHEK ROY,royabhishek2018,/Profile/royabhishek2018,"New Delhi, India",50
haridwar,"I stayed in the hotel for 2 days with my family booked 2 rooms but while vacating they charged us for 3 rooms saying 4 people cannot stay in a room while this should have been informed well in advance while check in. Moreover pathetic staff if you ask any thing they will reply that the last customer stole it and it will take ages to come . NO POWER BACK UP, PATHETIC FOOD, UNHYGIENIC ROOMS in short they are thieves running a hotel. PLEASE STAY TO RUIN YOUR VACATION",Sibi M,/Profile/SibiM32,,10
haridwar,"Worst experience ever,,,,,they are bloody cheats, My family stayed there for 2 days with no power back up.  There staff is veryyyyy rude and unprofessional. Food is also not good.  Please don't stay there........",Surbhi S,/Profile/115surbhis,,10
haridwar,"My family  stayed in two rooms but these people charged us for three rooms saying 4 people are not allowed in one room. we argued that this should have been  informed earlier. Imagine we payed for a room where we didn't even stayed. And other guests also had the same problem in this hotel, so it is a regular practice here.  Cherry on the cake was the rude staff who  treated us so bad.  Please save yourself from falling into these people's trap. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TRIP ON THIS HOTEL.

haridwar,a quite place to spend week end on the Bank of Holly Ganga River. Hotel is situated right on he Bank with a private bathing Ghat situated at the basement of the hotel where a person can enjoy the luxury of bathing in Ganga without being disturbed by other travelers,Murari Lal Biyala,/Profile/biyalaml,"Mumbai, India",40
haridwar," Totally Un professional. Ac not worked. No care of coustmor. The only good thing is it's great view. The hotel has its private Ghat, but there is no sanitation on Ghat. There septic tank of waste water is just next to the Bathing ghat. The hotel is run by a person who is not trained to run a hotel. ",Rohit G,/Profile/RohitG1711,,40
