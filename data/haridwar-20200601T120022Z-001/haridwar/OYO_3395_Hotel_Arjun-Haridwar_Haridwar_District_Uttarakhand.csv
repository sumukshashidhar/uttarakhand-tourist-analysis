haridwar,Stayed here for two nights. The front desk people are quite helpful esp. Mr. Vidhani. The room is as it should be for a budget hotel. The balcony is only for its namesake. There is no lift but my room was at first floor so no issue. Restaurant facility is there. A lot of street foods esp. gujrati are available in plenty. The famous Raghubansi (Gujrati) Bhojnalaya is available nearby where one can eat stomachful  at fixed price. Railway station is at walking distance.Bus Stand is also not far away - one can go by rikshaw. Transport available all the times. One thing to keep in mind - you are booking a budget hotel not a luxury one so be contended with the facilities. ,Ratnesh M,/Profile/ratnesh045,"New Delhi, India",30
haridwar,"Stayed in this hotel for a stopover from Haridwar to Delhi. Very close to the railway station(less than 5 minutes by walk). Situated in a very narrow lane besides shiv murti circle. The room had what was described. The furniture and bathroom fittings looked old but were functioning. No heater but only air conditioner(cooling only). The beds were clean and room size is decent. If you want just a decent place to crash before catching a train next day, I'd recommend this place.",LLO F,/Profile/LLOF1,,40

haridwar,I booked this hotel through OYO. I liked the location of the hotel. It's 10 minutes walking distance from the railway station /bus stand. The room and bathroom were decent. I liked the gujju street it was on so lots of gujju food!!! The reason for the low rating is that the hotel had a problem with the generator. They knew about it in the morning but didn't fix it. In the night we kept losing electricity and there was no backup for the fans.,BharathiMani,/Profile/BharathiMani,"Bengaluru, India",30
haridwar,"Hotel Arjun was booked through OYO and the ambience of the hotel is very nice.  Breakfast is complimenmtary.  Staff members are very verty helpful.  When I reached Haridwar it was early morning 0300 hours though the check in time was 1200 hours.  They accommodated us immediately by giving the well furnished rooms and it was hassle free. Early morning they arranged a decent Cab for our sight seeing and the driver was well versed with the topography of the entire Haridwar.  and it was a pleasant journey. Next day trip to Rishikesh was arranged by the guidance of the M.D. himself and it was a very very pleasant trip, The Hotel staff took personal care and with their pleasing manners they win the heart of one and all.

haridwar,"Hotel Arjun is located within the streets of haridwar. So you want to experience haridwar this is a good selection. The Service was great as opposed to the experience in Hotel Era, OYO Flagship Delhi Airport. The rate card for food was also budget. The single pain point was the lift was not working, hope its a temporary glitch. We had been offered rooms in the 2nd floor. The rooms were OK with no frills.They were not spacious, quite small but serves the purpose. A/C was a pain point in one of the rooms, it becomes important to have a good A/C if you are visiting north in summer hence the hotels need to be very sensitive to customers. The complimentary breakfast again not a buffet was good. We had to make do with the food in bits and pieces as they were being sourced from",Vishwanathan R,/Profile/vishwanathanr2016,,30

haridwar,We stayed here only for one night and it was ok but I would recommend another hotel if it's for more.  The furniture are old and the room is not 100 % clean but at least the bed is. We used the big bed for three people because they didn't had a spare bed for the third person. The bathroom is ok but if you want a hot shower it will be on the indian way.
