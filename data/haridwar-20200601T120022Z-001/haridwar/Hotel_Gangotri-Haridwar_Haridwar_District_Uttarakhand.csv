haridwar,Hotel as such is average. availability of food when in need is not there. You have to order it in advance. Not a good hotel if you have planned to visit temples in Haridwar. don't pick this hotel. Approach road to this hotel is pathetic & you feel highly unsecured. Safety issues if you go in the evening. OYO rooms will show this as budget hotels and misguide. Don;t pick this hotel by mistake. Keep in mind that you need to travel atleast 20kms from Haridwar.,Ravi R,/Profile/ravir909,,30
