haridwar,"Plus - Well located is the best thing about this otherwise very average hotel.  It is an easy walk to markets, the river, eateries.   Negatives - The breakfast was disappointing in that there were not many choices, however you will get some fruit and toast and cereal.  If you stay here remember to take earplugs otherwise you may be woken at a ridiculous hour by LOUD clanging bells from the ashram or temple next door!",Mary-Lou K,/Profile/Trezona,"Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa",30
