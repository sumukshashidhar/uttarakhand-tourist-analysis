haridwar,Old receptionist's behaviour was so rude. Worst customer service ever I seen. The old receptionist warns the customers. Even after taking the full amount he is telling u leave the hotel now. Really frustrating. Bathroom is dirty. And in bed u will get bugs.,Ajit K,/Profile/AjitK492,,10
haridwar,"Hotel wasn't great, window panes missing in rooms which made it very loud when you're trying to sleep. Parties were booked into hotel restaurant, so we were told we couldn't use it. Only one english speaking member of staff, which made it difficult, but all the staff tried to be very friendly. bathrooms were horrible, windows wouldnt close and everything leaking. Good price for budget hotels though. Good location, well sign posted.",laura_chap25,/Profile/laura_chap25,"Winchester, United Kingdom",30
haridwar,"The hotel is situated very near to the railway station and the Ganges , the helpful staff , clean rooms and budgetary tariff makes the hotel a great place for holiday. The hotel staff also assists you in booking your travel tickets which really helps.",samitgujral,/Profile/samitgujral,"New Delhi, India",40
