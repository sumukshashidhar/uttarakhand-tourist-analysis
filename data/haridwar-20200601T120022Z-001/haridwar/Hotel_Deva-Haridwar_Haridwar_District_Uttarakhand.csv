haridwar,"Terrible experience with this hotel's absurd and impolite manager. Completely illiterate and don't know how to behave with guests. They don't have family room and MMT app is not accepting check in for 4 people. Then I spoke to this guy, he told me over phone four can be accommodated. Later when we went there he rejected for check in and  talking rudely. Dont ever stay in this hotel. Staff is very bad and mannersless. Though I paid him extra money for my two other family members his behaviour is very rude.   I have been using MMT for a long time but never had seen such kind of rude management and impolite staff. MMT, you should feel regretful for making such kind of hotel as your partners.",Vasudeva,/Profile/murthy145,,10
haridwar,"Check In date 6-8-2018, check out date 7-8-2018  • Location on Google map takes you to another hotel by name hotel dev nearby. Hotel is little inside so you have to ask locals to reach. • Check in time is 12pm, however when i reached there at 1.40pm, room was not ready and after my arrival only they made the room. • Air Conditioner and fan both makes noise. • If electricity goes, AC doesn't work on generator. • Morning 4 am there was no electricity. I woke up the staff and asked him to start generator but he didn't for 30 min. I then asked again as it was getting very humid in room and also i have to get ready to catch early morning train. Then they started it. Contact number given in booking was switched off at this time. • One charging point near bed. • No intercom phone in",shoyjoseph,/Profile/shoyjoseph,,30

haridwar,"Its a small hotel, but a decent one, 10 minutes walking distance to the station , manager is very attentive to the problems. Room are neat & clean , good for solo travelers & family.not sure if they have their own kitchen as we had stayed only for one night & left early morning.  but for solo travelers &  for one night stay its a good choice as its close to the station.",sachindedhia,/Profile/sachindedhia,"Mumbai, India",40
