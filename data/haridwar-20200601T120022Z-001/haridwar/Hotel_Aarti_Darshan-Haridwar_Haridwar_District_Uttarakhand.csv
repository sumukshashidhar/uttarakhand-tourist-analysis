haridwar,Hotel Aarti Darshan is the worst one....Staff are terrible....front desk guys were worst and indifferent..i went with family and they have no consideration...rooms are worst quality...AC is broken and beds have bugs in it. broken toilet seat..gloomy ambience...it is a mess in the middle of a messy location...only reason to book is its proximity to Har ki Pauri...otherwise guys don't book this hotel at all..,Neel,/Profile/Neeldesigner,,10
