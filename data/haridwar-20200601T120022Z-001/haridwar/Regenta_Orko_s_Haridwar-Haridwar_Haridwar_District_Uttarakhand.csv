haridwar,Haridwar Regenta Orko's is not like the usual Regenta Hotels. Breakfast buffet was normal and not the usual Regenta Breakfast. The dinner was also just fine and not great. Rooms were normal however housekeeping staff in the night was not good providing the services requested for. The staff during the day was very helpful. Front desk did provide helpful information related to travel around Haridwar and Rishikesh.,KarunaShastri,/Profile/KarunaShastri,"Bengaluru, India",30

I stayed here along with my family with my kids and the stay was quite comfortable. It was quite cold in Haridwar, but the room heating was extremely effective. The best part of the hotel was its buffet lunch and dinner. Both were three course meals which we enjoyed a lot.  The hotel can host small events for 30-40 people as well.

If your primary objective is Hari Ki Pauri and Ganga Aarti, then it may not be the best choice.  However, mobility is not a problem as rickshaw's are available in plenty.  Food is a bit on the costlier side, and the spread in the morning is rather limited.  The hotel is getting aged and seems to be in for a revamp. Keep that in mind while choosing the same.

There was an issue with the safety locker not getting opened. The front office Manager Azim came along with the repair man to get it right. This was really a good gesture. Breakfast spread was good. The hotel serves Vegetarian buffet for dinner and breakfast. Being vegetarian, this was good for us. There is however one issue that needs to be resolved by the Hotel. We had taken a room at the back to avoid the sound of traffic on the Highway. Whereas, the room was good but a Railway Line was just at the back side. The rumbling and whistle of the trains was quite a nuisance. Sound proof windows can be a solution as this must be heard in every room.",MPS619,/Profile/MPS619,"New Delhi, India",40

haridwar,1. Room size: Royal club room has a good size. Bathroom is very small. You may actually not fit into shower area. There is no exhaust in the bathroom. Its very suffocative.   2. Location: Far from Har ki pauri. If you are going to haridwar then you may want to look for options near Ganga river. This hotel is approximately 8 kms from Har Ki pauri where the ganga aarti is performed.   3. Food: Very limited buffet breakfast. Almost every day same options of food with one or two changes.   4. Cleanliness: Although housekeeping is in-house but they don’t clean the room properly.   5. Room service: Be ready to keep calling reception/in room dining/ house keeping for every small thing you need as they do not provide it upfront.

From the outside the hotel looks good but inside it’s another story- the room wasn’t clean with dust lying around and the restaurant was another big issue for us- choice of food was very limited mostly to indian - the waiters were clumsy and inefficient though they tried their best-it’s as if they hadn’t received any training-one of them broke a glass during dinner and the next morning the broken glass was still to be found on a side table.  our breakfast was limited to toast and cereals as we are not too keen on indian breakfast items.

We had a breakfast in their cafeteria and really enjoyed that. Good variety and quite fresh good taste. Note that I am pure vegetarian so review is about vegetarian recipes only.  Parking space is available and staff helps for that. There is a small garden with swings (jhoola) so you can feel natural breeze there.   Cons: Location is on road but far away from any market place.  You need to have ur own vehicle. Also you will not get anything outside as no smallest shop is there.

Hot water comes 24 hours, they turn off heater again in the day time and that is when I wanted to have a good nap.

The food at hotel was mind blowing  Last year I  visited to more than 3 hotel's in Haridwar. But as compared to other  I would like to give Country Inn Rank 1. Now I used to visit in Country Inn. It is a perfect place with purity. I am recommending Country Inn to my friends and relatives. Country Inn is a place you would definitely come back",bharataggarwal,/Profile/bharataggarwal,Rohtak,40

haridwar,"For me, it is the best hotel among all in the region of Haridwar – Hrishikesh. Being group of Carlson, it tries to maintain the sense of international hospitability.  Rooms are well decorated , centrally cooled / heated. A separate wardrobe portion is beneficial for travelers. You can have a look of ‘Rajaji National Park’ from the room or balcony.  Bathroom has all amenities but small in size. Showering portion should have been little more wider.   You can have facility of free Wi Fi connectivity in the rooms.   This is the hotel among very few there where you will get Non vegetarian food.  Front desk associates & other staffs are well mannered.    Only thing may disturb you is noise of trains passing on its tracks just behind the hotel. Who knows you may like its views from",DebasishMandal,/Profile/DebasishMandal,"Mumbai, India",50
haridwar,The Country Inn Suites is a warm cosy getaways about 7km up Haridwar on the Haridwar-Rishikesh Highway.  We arrived after a really exhausting road trip that had taken us the entire night to get to Haridwar from Delhi and were just about tired enough to crash into bed immediately.  Fortunately the Hotel Check-In was quick and painless and they even gave us a room at 7 am in the morning even though we were booked from 12pm on that day.  The Rooms are spacious and airy and the food is quite good. Service is above average. The bathrooms have clean warm running water throughout (aaah the perfect temperature to soothe frazzled muscles after a long drive). All in all a very pleasant experience and we came away thinking we stayed at the best possible place in Haridwar (couldnt see any,ShettyFromDelhi,/Profile/ShettyFromDelhi,Delhi,40

haridwar,"We stayed there in Oct, we wanted to be in Haridwar for Diwali, which is a big festival in India.  The hotel had nothing planned for that night, it was a big disppointed, you would think for a hotel that size something would have been planned.  The railway line right behind the hotel was suprise to us, it was a very busy rail line which meant we always heard the train.  The food was good, but the dinning area very small, there were many times that we had to wait for a table, I think the dinning area sitted maybe 50, I'm pretty sure that were more than 50 rooms in this hotel.  Service at the dinning room was good.    There is a small store on the ground floor of this hotel which is owned and run by the most horrible person I met in India, if you looked at items he had to sell and",F_Canadian_A,/Profile/F_Canadian_A,"Victoria, Canada",30

haridwar,"Was in the city for a day (maybe 16hrs) and stayed with the country inn ,having heard that it is a good property but was gravely dissapointed the room was right next to a rail track which ensured we would get no sleep as trains whizzed past every 20 odd minutes now mind you the hotel could have given us a quiter room because it was empty but they did not bother ,the shampoo in the bathroom was half empty without a cap(some one must have forgotten to change them) the complimentry cookies were half eaten and kept for us....revolting !!! is the word ...anyway thought we would have dinner in the roof top sizzler joint (ORKO's) but guess what that was closed too(which their website lists as open).....and to make matters worst you cannot sit in the balcony to relax because apart from",nairajay10,/Profile/nairajay10,"New Delhi, India",10

haridwar,"As expected of a big hotel chain, this hotel was fairly modern, clean and comfortable and from what i know one of the few such hotels in the area. Our only qualm was with the restaurant - where a lot of things on the menu were unavailable when we tried to order these. Despite it being a ""continental"" restaurant most items on the menu were Indian or Chinese with the exception of pizza and fries! We resorted to ordering some Chinese food which actually was tasty.   Since we spent only one night here I can't comment on much more - but what mattered was that we got a good night's rest and a hot shower - both of which we got!",ThruTheLens,/Profile/ThruTheLens,"London, UK",30

haridwar,"I have stayed at some five star hotels in India, and I have also stayed in mud huts, but this was by far the worst experience I have ever had. The room was filled with dust and there was hair on the bathroom floor. The food offered in the minibar was all rotten. The dinner buffet should be avoided at all costs. The food is not properly maintained and not safe to eat. From it I contracted the worst food poisoning I have ever had traveling through India. I do not recommend this place, but it is one of the few hotels in the area. My advice is to travel with caution and avoid their restaurant at all costs.",Imli,/Profile/Imli,"Geneva, Switzerland",10
