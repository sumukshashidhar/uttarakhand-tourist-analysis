haridwar,"I reached haridwar very late because of traffic jam. But in the bus I met Anshul Verma . he helped me to find this hotel. He called his friend abhay ( owner of this hotel) very late but he arranged a room for me on one call. Thank you Anshul. I stayed there for one night. Felt Very relaxed. Staff is superb. Hotel is very clean, affordable and friendly. I will come back next time and stay more. Thanx abhay . very highly recommended.",rahscorpio,/Profile/rahscorpio,,50
