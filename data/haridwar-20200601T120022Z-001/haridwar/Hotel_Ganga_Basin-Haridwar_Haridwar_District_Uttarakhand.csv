haridwar,This good according to location and view of the Ganga from the room. All other its ok. Rooms are specious and clean but require more maintenance. With family yes you can stay. No restaurant available in this hotel you have to go outside but not a big problem find out. Staff is very good. And Har ki pouri just at your foot step only 150m.  ,Arya,/Profile/AryaOl,"New Delhi, India",40
haridwar,We stayed in this hotel for two nights on 22/10/2019-23/10/2019. We saw rats roaming inside the super duluxe ac room no.103 at night. The rats even damaged our luggage. The hotel staff did nothing after being informed about the presence of rats inside the room.,Rahul C,/Profile/358rahulc,"Kolkata, India",20

Food quality was good. Very polite stuff. It was my unforgettable experience because of comfort stay.,joygopal008,/Profile/joygopal008,"New Delhi, India",50
