haridwar,Hotel is overall good. Rooms are clean and neat. Very bad behaviour from the staff. They don't seem to be interested in anything. Room service is also very poor. Staff don't even talk nicely. Lift and AC doesn't work in case of electricity cut off. They don't even have sugar free tea or coffee.,Sukant,/Profile/SukantK2,,30
haridwar,"The hotel room was okay okay, just acceptable. One can stay here.staff was friendly, they let me to sit on the hotel even after checkout time.the only thing that I didn't like it was the description of their hotel, it was written it is 0.5km from halki pauri but in reality it was nearly 2km from it. Rest was all good",BELIEVE I,/Profile/597believei,Mumbai,40
haridwar,"Never Go this hotel.Its a big fraud. The rooms are really a pain. we had booked our rooms in other hotel and the hotel was overbooked so they shifted us to this Hotel Jewel.We made a big mistake by shifting in this hotel. I was Travelling with my family with some real old age people. We had 3 Rooms in this hotel and 3 persons in a room guess what they give us 1 towel, 1 Soap among 3 persons in a room,when we asked extra soap and towel they denied. The rooms were in real bad shape, very dirty and bathroom was at its worst. The real worst thing was when 3 of our Mobile Phones went missing rooms.When informed the same to the manager and owner,they denied of any such incidence happened.When asked them to check with security camera they owner said the camera is not working.The",Chandravir,/Profile/Chandravir,Udaipur Rajasthan,10

haridwar,"A very basic budget hotel, good location, and helpful staff. No marks for cleanliness. If staying here, bargain a lot at the reception before booking. I paid 600 rupees for a day stay, and was later informed I could have bargained a little more.",saria_abhishek,/Profile/saria_abhishek,"Jaipur, India",30
haridwar,"Hotel Jewel is almost midway between Haridwar Railway Station and Har Ki Pauri. A rickshaw will charge you around Rs. 20-30 from the Rly. Station.  We were given 2 'D/B rooms with TV' on the ground floor. -The rooms were pretty spacious -Although on the ground floor, the rooms and the bathrooms were pretty airy. -Rooms were clean.  -Beds were clean and comfortable. -There was some water leakage problem in the bathroom but it was quickly attended to on report. - No geysers, but hot water was supplied on request. - Filtered water served in the rooms. - Not noisy. - Hotel manager was pretty well behaved and prompt in attending to the guests. - Room rent- Rs. 600/- for 'Standard D/B Room with Cable TV'.  - Overall the 'Decent Hotel for a Budget Traveller'.",SrikChak,/Profile/SrikChak,"Asansol, India",30
haridwar,We stayed in this hotel for just 1/2 day as our train to Kathgodam was at 00:20. Biggest USP of this hotel is the location. It is between railway station and Har ki Pauri. Food is pathetic. Ofcourse can expect quality food from this place. Room is basic and I can say there is value for money.,Praveen D,/Profile/pomski,"Bengaluru, India",30
haridwar,The hotel walls are full of fungi. The bathroom is dirty. I booked this hotel due to non availability of others. I booked a room from their hotel in Jaipur and that was a cheat. By god the owner had to suffer!!!,Joyraj N,/Profile/Jrkalita,,10
haridwar,"We stay 3 nights at this hotel.  The only room we can get was on the street side.  What a big mistake !  The room was full of cockroach and the wife kill them before aligning it on the front on the door step.  I dont say that for making the things worst but it's true.  And we where sick in our arrival at Haridwar.  So we decide to shop for a ticket to Goa.  We finally agree to purchase it at the hotel travel agencie.  The office look nice and the employee serious.  It was a biger mistakes than the last one.  We insist leaving at 4h00 in the morning.  The taxi, a friend of the hotel manager, arrive at 4:45.  After an hell of the ride for arriving at time, guest what... Having missing our plane, we have to spend a night in a Delhi pretty expensive hotel near the airport.

haridwar,"How amazing! we have same experience with the Jewel hotel and the smooth talking chethan jha and his brothers.  We booked an entire tour from Haridwar to Badrinath and back to Haridwar which included a car which is supposed to drop us back in Delhi airport after the Badri trip.  We also paid the whole amount for high end (Ac/heated) hotels for which amounted more than Rs. 3000 to 4500 per night.  But we were given very cheap hotel in Rudra prayag.  When we reached Badri, the hotel Narayan palace informed us that their hotel is booked for the entire next month and the  voucher given by jewel hotel is a fake.  We had to find our own accomodation.  Again in Deoprayag we experienced the same and we had to return back to Haridwar. The car which is supposed to drop us in Delhi airport",mimikar,/Profile/mimikar,Karnataka,10
haridwar,"I had booked this hotel online in January for stay during Kumbh Mela. The owner sent me an email confirming my booking and informing me that I would have to pay an additional amount as rent has gone up.  When I arrived at the hotel the owner informed me taht my booking was ""canceled"". I had to stay in a nearby hotel.  When I tried to get my booking amount refunded from the portal through which I had booked the hotel. The owner of hotel Jewel claimed that he had arranged alternative accommodation for me booking for me and the booking amount to the other hotel was paid by him!  Please avoid this hotel and be ware of the smooth-talking owner of the hotel",pilgrimm2010,/Profile/pilgrimm2010,India,10
haridwar,"The Hotel is good. But dont make any deals of tour package with the owner. They are cheaters and will charge twice the amount of the tour. I have been cheated badly.So be careful,overall a nice hotel and cant say any complaints with food",shalinir,/Profile/shalinir,bangalore,10
