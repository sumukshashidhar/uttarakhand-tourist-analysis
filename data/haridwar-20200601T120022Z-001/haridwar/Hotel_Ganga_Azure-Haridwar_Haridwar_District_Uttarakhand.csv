haridwar,"its easy to build a property but difficult to manage it commercially. I stayed for two nights in late October 2019. Technically no complaints, but I observed it was a bit stinky. The intercom in the room was just a showpiece with no cable, washrooms were clean but stinky, probably plumbing issues. The staff appeared active and welcoming though. I think its all due to the price war that hotels are unable to maintain the quality.",Mountain_Shepherds,/Profile/Mountain_Shepherds,"Auli, India",30
haridwar,Best location and food. That's all. Nothing to write more. Dertiest 3 star hotel I have seen. No daily room cleaning. Bedsheets not changed for four days. Just opposit Haridwar railway station. Haraki paudi is very near. About 10 minutes walking distance,BabaRajkot,/Profile/BabaRajkot,"Kolhapur, India",30
haridwar,"Visited/Stayed after 24 years & was surprised to find good/improved image since that time. A very good place with good location but mind you, don't expect star kind of professional service/s. Rooms are spacious but thought process is not used. We took family room with two walls separating the big room in two but management chose to remove TV from other side of wall (as informed). Overall the experience was very good with great food (taken care of Govind) & fabulous service by Himanshu. Still not a hotel for people expecting professional attitude.",buddyofall,/Profile/buddyofall,"Lagos, Nigeria",40

haridwar,"Situated just 400 mtrs from Haridwar railway station, this is I would say one of the best hotels to stay in Haridwar. We visited during October 3rd week, during our tour of Delhi-Haridwar-Mathura-Agra. At every other place, when we enquired about early checkout, they refused, but only here the staff at reception was courteous and polite enough to say that they will arrange. We arrived around 6:30 AM (Mussourie Express from Delhi) - and although our checkin time was 12PM, they arranged room for us withing 1 hour. Another noticable thing was the beds : every other place when I booked a room for 3 persons, they provider 1 double bed and extra mattress, only here there was a single bed already there in both the rooms. Hotel has wifi with decent speed. Ganga ghat is situated arund",Pritam Kumar Paul,/Profile/pritamkp,"Hyderabad, India",50
haridwar,"Do you know that feeling of relief when you reach your hotel room and sink into the bed after a tiring day of travel? That is NOT the feeling I had at the Ganga Azure.   When we checked in, we found that the room had used linen, with stained sheets and strands of hair from the previous guest still on the bedsheet. The dustbin was still full. The floor, too, had trash from a previous guest. The hotel staff insisted that the room had been cleaned. We requested it be swept and mopped and the linen changed, which the hotel did.  Still, the musty smell that pervaded the room didn’t ever go. The bathroom shower curtain is less a shower curtain and more of a giant petri dish: it clearly hasn't been cleaned ever, and the colony of black mould growing on it now stretches from end to end.",GreyVitriol,/Profile/GreyVitriol,"New Delhi, India",30
haridwar,"Where to start from. I booked double room AC. No toilet paper, no rubber mat. The AC is an old one no cooling only sound. The door lock was broken had to request the desk several times to get it fixed. Finally it was done on the second day. No wardrobe in the room, uncomfortable blankets. The list is unending. The only good thing was that the toilet was clean. And it's near the bus stand and railway station. That's another plus. The restaurant within the hotel is good bur exorbitant price n less quantity. ",Jayoti D,/Profile/AbhishekJayoti,,10
haridwar,"Me and my mother were allotted the dirtiest room. Could not close the door of toilet and it stinked continually. The tea we ordered was tasteless. Room was not at all worth the money they charged us. Even though the room was pre-booked, got the worst facility. Wil definitely think several times before goin there again. ",Radhika R,/Profile/RadhikaR197,,10
haridwar,"Booked one a.c room over phone. The nroom was ok but the bathroom was filthy. Soap and towel(dirty)was provided after repeated request. The a.c brokdown in the middle of the night. As there was no window in the room,Had to shift to a non a.c room. The only redeeming features was that they charged the non a.c tariff for my stay.",subhasishdhar,/Profile/subhasishdhar,"Durgapur, India",20
haridwar,"I was here for 3 days. The main reason i booked this hotel it was vey near to the haridwar railway station, like 3-4 minutes walk from the station. I booked it at a very cheap rate from makemytrip as it was monsoon season. The hotel staffs were very friendly and cooperative.",Anup_Sinha,/Profile/Anup_Sinha,"Mechelen, Belgium",40
haridwar,"Pretty big and clean Hotel, clean toilets and rooms, but the rooms are stuffed with too many furnitures thus reducing free space...best part of the Hotel is the location..it is located bang opposite to Haridwar Railway Station...",Anirban,/Profile/Anirban0302,"Kolkata, India",40
haridwar,"Booked this Hotel due to the sole reason that it is very near to the Railway Station. had seen its grandeur on previous visits but had not stayed ever. On reaching was impressed with the spacious lounge in the reception area. The front man asked for ID - I gave, then he insisted for signing the photocopy of my ID which is legally not required, so rightfully I refused. I asked for any authority for asking for the same, they could not but accepted my refusal.   I was given room no. 205. It had two separate beds with attached baths and the only window which opens inside was fitted with one cooler. The room rate flashed at the reception was Rs. 950/-. I was a bit disappointed as there was a great variance in the outward look of the hotel and the facilities/comforts provided inside",Ratnesh M,/Profile/ratnesh045,"New Delhi, India",20
haridwar,Great place to stay in Haridwar near the railway station but very peaceful.The rooms are clean and staff is cordial and polite. The hotel also has a very nice resturant Big Ben that serves multi cuisine vegetarian food.,Dilip B,/Profile/dilipkumarb2016,Mumbai,40
haridwar,"The Rooms are strictly OK, but this Hotel enjoys some good points going in her favour e.g. being in close proximity to Haridwar Railway & Bus Stations and other attractions e.g. Hari ki Paudi etc. I'd however their food a bit better than their rooms upkeep and services.  However, it gets marred by not so efficient services. Be prepaed for a long haul and plenty of patience required, while your food would arrive.  However the taste was good with prices a bit high for the value provided.",alok K,/Profile/akr0072016,"Noida, India",30
haridwar,"I booked air-cooled double bedroom it was small, no air circulation at all, bathroom was smelly not so cleaned.  Room service and behavior of the staffs are poor and seems very greedy.  They charged 1000 rs extra while checking out because we used the air-cooler installed in the room.  They were not listened at all that A/C means air conditioner and not air cooler.  Another manger denied to accept the make my trip booking saying that he does not care until I re-book by giving him hard cash in hand..so ridiculous.",Suvabrata M,/Profile/SuvabrataM2,,20
haridwar,"I stayed here having arrived in the middle of the night from a train journey.  The room was OK, it was fairly grubby and run down and the ensuite was extremely dirty.  I'm the morning, renovation works began very early in the room next to mine. As I was leaving early this just gave me an extra push to get out. Upon check out, I asked the receptionist for advice on how to reach my next hotel down by the ghats and he just showed me the door. I asked again and he said ""I don't know"". He spoke English as I was chatting to him before this. Very unimpressed with the service of this man and the condition of the hotel.  There are lots of flies in the reception area too.",Cailintharlear,/Profile/Cailintharlear,"Seville, Spain",20
haridwar,"Rooms: we had two separate beds with ensuite bathroom. Sheets were not cleaned as was the bathroom. Aircon hardly worked. Smelly towels. The room all together felt dirty and not maintained. We paid Rp1300 for a night.  Staff: checkin took long, had to fill out more than regular and we were oh so tired. Staff wasn't very thoughtful, had to bargain down the price for water that we bought from the hotel.  Facilities: wifi didn't work Location: restaurants are nearby and so is the train station. I've rated a 3 because of this because it wasn't our best stay in India.",Floris v,/Profile/Florisv_12,"Tilburg, The Netherlands",30
haridwar,"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in the cheapest rooms on the second floor, because we arrived quite late from Delhi by train. At first, I should mention that on the top floor there are very good newly refurnished rooms which are rather expensive but worth taking! I noticed that the hotel is currently under some type of reconstruction/ painting...but it is still working. The room was very cold and dampy, cannot say it was very clean. No toilet paper at all :) But provided us with a clean towel. Bedsheets were very old but seemed to be clean, but still in such rooms I always cover pillows with my own scarf (just in case). Location is very good - u can easily reach the railway and bus station simply by walking, so if u need to catch an early train/ bus, this can be the best",Jam4ika,/Profile/Jam4ika,"Moscow, Russia",30
haridwar,"This hotel is right in front of the railway station. We can walk and go there. It is a neat place. Staff are helpful. They have a restaurant Big Ben which is part of the hotel.

haridwar,A good and a economy hotel right on the main road opposite the Rly Station.  The Big Ben restaurant serves good vegetarian food .

haridwar,"After checking many hotels booked a room in this hotel, was expecting it to be good but was okay type. Rooms were nice and clean but were old fashioned, I took a Super Deluxe room and was surprised to see a small 14 Inch TV in the room and that too hooked on the wall at the level of 6 Ft. Location was good near railway station with several restaurants around. Overall can stay in this hotel if don't want to spend more and doesn't expect a room was all modern amenities.",Gaurav_agg2000,/Profile/Gaurav_agg2000,"Bengaluru, India",30
haridwar,"Quite disappointing. I heard about this hotel from a forum, someone recommended it. We stayed in this place because we arrived Haridwar late, around 10.30pm and didn't want to go around look for rooms at that hour.  The cheapest room is 950 rupees which is a twin bed double room. The room smelled a bit old and musty, the fan was making a lot of noise, which is normal in India but worst of all, the toilet seat had pea stains on it. Three tear drop pea-stains! Cleaned it ourselves with tissue paper. The toilet is not great to look at.   It's just a very old hotel, not well maintained with a grumpy looking and unfriendly team of staffs. A bit of a weird vibe. We decided to look for another hotel the next day.  There was wifi in the hotel but not in the rooms. Only in the reception",Marge S,/Profile/MargeS678,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",20

Location is very good i.e. in from of the railway station & near Har ki pauri., but definitely it is a very crowded place. To avoid crowd, one can go to Bypass road near Viswakarma Ghat. We took a family room where 4 beds were available. AC was effective. Can halt for a night or so.",Ritesh_Shivaansh,/Profile/Ritesh_Shivaansh,"New Delhi, India",30
haridwar,"Well to begin with I've been to this hotel for too many times. We are always go for budget travel while going to Haridwar as it is a spiritual place and we are not in mood to spend a luxurious hotels.  The Hotel is can say situated in the heart of Haridwar. It takes 10 minutes on rickshaw to go to Har ki Pauri. The rooms quality has diminished whenever we go, so for the last two years we have dropped the idea of  going to Ganga Azure. However its restaurant Big Ben serves good food, but the service is very poor. But in the heat in May its air conditioner hall is a reliever..",Anil K,/Profile/anilkakkar,"Hapur, India",30

haridwar,"To start with the broom cupboard sized rooms, the moth eaten beddings, the dirty bathrooms and the non-heated ""deluxe"" rooms surely do not justify 2000 bucks a night. Even the Dharmashalas in the town offer competitive services. However, food and room service was good. The staff was courteous. Overall, the hotel seriously needs to re-think on its maintenance in terms of hygiene and the rates it quotes. Also someone pls tell them that the definition of Deluxe is not a AC fitted room",Parikshit S,/Profile/Parikshit2010,New Delhi,20
haridwar,Like this hotel . Good clean room. staff polite. food good. near station and 1.5 km from har ki pudi where we went 3 times  so good location.
