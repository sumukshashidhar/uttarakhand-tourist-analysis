haridwar,"Location wise okay walk able distance from Haridwar railway Station & Bus Stand just opposite to Gurudwara. The rooms are really clumsy, NO ventilation. Cleanliness require special attention. The rooms are okay if you just want to sleep, No natural light in day time. They are providing food services but no restaurant attached to it. It's better to eat outside.",ajoshi303,/Profile/ajoshi303,"New Delhi, India",30
haridwar,"I had a great weekend in Haridwar and Rishikesh last week. Hotel Ganga Vilas, Haridwar is nice place to stay as is walking distance from both railway station and bus stand. Har-Ki-Pauri is just a walk away. You can hire peddled rickshaw for just Rs20. You can take a bus from bus stand to Rishikesh and come back in same day if you wish. It was a pleasant stay in hotel as it is nice and quite with very supportive staff.",bipul k,/Profile/bipulk41,,40
haridwar,"We stayed in this hotel, the rooms is pretty decent in size. Location of the hotel is good just walking distance from Railway Station however approx 1.5 kms from Har ki Pauri. They charge very high for the food as comparison to the quality of food they offer. Overall experience was very good. I love to the location. It is very prime location. Rooms are also very good. Complete value for money,  Thumbs up from my side if you are looking for a nice and pleasant stay at Haridwar.",shanky2372,/Profile/shanky2372,"Chandigarh, India",50
haridwar,"It is a budgeted hotel for a night stay with family . But there is parking problem a the approach road is too much congested & in rainy season even difficult to reach the reception from your car hardly 5 ft away because of dirty water ,",maheshkj,/Profile/maheshkj,"Navi Mumbai, India",20
haridwar,"The location is just fine from my point of view. You get a calmer road facing the hotel than the bustling main road just 50 meters away. It is near the main chauk before har ki paudi and from this chauk easy to get auto/rikshaw for rishikesh, har ki paudi and chandi devi mandir. The main road not allow even rikhaw till har ki paudi so if u wamt to go by rikshae you need to catch from this chauk which ply on opposote road. AC worked fine and that was a relief due to hot weather. During our 2 night stay we enjoyed food from hotel and that was just fine..fresh preparation and i liked. Hotel staff were also nice and courteous. I feel laundry quality could have been better, specially towels need some special processing and deodorization to make it perfect budget stay.

haridwar,"We stayed two night at the place, which in internet looks really good, but it was all the oposite, in internet said Wifi in all the hotel, but the signal was available just in reception and first floor, they don't have airport and taxi service, you have to take it by yourself, the staff don't speak any english word, and is really hard to communicate with them and looks like they don't care about it, also they laugh at you every time you ask something, definitely the attention was terrible, they never knock the door at the moment to enter in the room. The bedroom was dirty, dust in the floor, the towel was disgusting, definitely we don't recommend to anyone. There are others hotels near this, same price and lot better.",Belen S,/Profile/55belens,,10

haridwar,"Pros - Very close to Haridwar station.  Cons - Everything else  This is one of those hotels, which you should avoid at all cost! I was delusional when I decided to book this hotel. I had only one thing in my mind, I wanted to get a decent hotel which is closer to the station which this hotel did meet. I went by the pictures posted for this hotel and some positive reviews posted.  One thing, do not believe the photos and the positive reviews posted for this hotel. It is no where even near to what is posted.  When I arrived at the hotel, the reception guy was sleeping. I had to ask him to get up and after some time he did get up and started opening his registers. There was no one who could cater to our bags and we had to drag all the bags by ourselves.   We had booked 2 non ac",nilaanjant,/Profile/nilaanjant,,10
haridwar,The hotel Boasts of car parking facility but actually it has not any space for parking. You have to park car in front of hotel and space too is just for 3-4 cars. Food is hopeless even after complaining there is no improvement. For geyser you have to call reception and they too switch it on as they are doing some kind of favour. Room service and Reception also pick up phone after 3-4 calls. Not recommended.,sahil0417,/Profile/sahil0417,"Chandigarh, India",20

Though locationwise the hotel is slightly far off from the main Har-ki-pauri ghat, but one can easily walk the distance. Other ghats, like Birla ghat and Vishnu ghat, are nearby.

haridwar,"I visited Haridwar with my family and stayed in this hotel for 3 days. We booked two rooms. It is perfect choice for short travel. Location is perfect. Not on main market road, but just 3 blocks away inside the lane. This keeps hotel away from noisy street and peaceful. The location advantages are many - you get as many cycle and auto rickshaws, 3 blocks walk and you are on the main market road to shop handicrafts, traditional ethnic apparels, medicines, almost anything. Many restaurants around. The Haridwar Railway station is just 5-7 min walking distance, though better to hire a rickshaw to wade through human traffic. Its near to Ganga Ghats too.. For all young, you can explore and reach almost anywhere on foot. The food service is also quick and tastes good. The Hotel",Ajay D,/Profile/AjayD351,"Mumbai, India",40

For a 1000 - 2000 budget, the place is clean. It's convenient as its just across the Birla bridge and from here Har ki Pauri and other temples are Waking distance away. We checked in around 2 am. The staff were around to open the gate. They facilitated tea at 3 am in the morning when we checked out next morning. ",Deepa_Mridul,/Profile/Deepa_Mridul,"Mumbai (Bombay), India",40

Very modern, pleasent and clean.It is not usual to find this bathrooms in this kind of Hotels in India at this budget. We were at the end of our 3 weeks travel and it was very good to take a shower in that nice bathroom: big, modern and clean! The staff is very friendly and wanted always to know if everything was good with our stay. It is good situated, very near to the famous Big Ben Restaurant, and to the river. At night it was a little noisy at the streets, but in the center of Haridwar it might be difficult to find a hotel with no noise.
