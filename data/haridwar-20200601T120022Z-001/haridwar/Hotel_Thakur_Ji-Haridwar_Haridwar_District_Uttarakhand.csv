haridwar,"Easy check in to  a clean and comfortable room. It's really well placed bear a lot of food stalls and markets, and walking distance to a lot of main haridwar attractions (I wished we stayed in Haridwar longer. It's an excellent place, with so many different food options and things to do). The guys were friendly enough and for 800 rupees for a night, I have no complaints.

haridwar,"We booked two rooms for this hotel from Agoda. The AC rooms are small as compared to other hotels in Haridwar where I started earlier. Location wise okay centrally located near Railway Station & Bus Stand. They have free parking also but it really a big task to park through parking gate. There is a scope for more cleanliness in the room, Toilets were also not up to mark. Water was dripping from the flush create wastage of water.  Overall the stay was average.",ajoshi303,/Profile/ajoshi303,"New Delhi, India",30
haridwar,"Hotel ThakurJi is one of the great place to stay in Haridwar. Its very near to main HarrKiPauri place.  I had to plan a two day visit to Haridwar from Delhi. My train was supposed to reach early morning to Haridwar and I was looking for hotel which can give me 24hrs checkin. Many hotels denied and then I talked to Hotel Thakurji and he agreed for it. This is the first great thing about this hotel and it does not end here.   We reached Haridwar station and hotel person guided us properly to reach hotel.  After reaching hotel, all the three rooms which we booked were arranged and were in a very good condition.  Clean bed, bathroom clean .. it was worth every money.  Hotel staffs were very courteous.  Great food. We ordered lunch and dinner both from hotel only and it was awesome. ",manishsrivastava83,/Profile/manishsrivastava83,"Dallas, Texas",50
haridwar,"Hotel rooms not so big, I booked offline and Manager want to charge little extra in breakfast but not taken when I oppose. Actually drawback is wash room just adjacent to Bed, bathroom so small even not so clean,  Outside hotel mostly restaurants are of Gujrati & south indian food but punjabi food rare available. Only good thing is Har ki pauri is approx. 2 kms which is travelled by auto and AC is good. Lastly parking is in the basement of the hotel which is straight down and street is so squeezed/very narrow lane quite difficult to ride car. May be I will not prefer to visit Hotel Thakur Ji.",DelhiDarshan304551,/Profile/DelhiDarshan304551,"New Delhi, India",20
haridwar,"This hotel was very good in product view, well arranged rooms and spacious for this category, we booked for double rooms , but it was comfortable 4 people. Bathrooms are good , only thing WC seat was broken and Housekeeping was not bothered to solve the issue. A cute property in the banks of Gana river. Ganga was to closer to this hotel hardly 5 minutes walk. Staff should improve their guest approach with smiley face.One of the major problem was it does not have parking facility for big vehicles like Traveller. The road in front this hotel is too narrow and very difficult to drop the guest. Hotel is least bothered about parking our vehicle and we had lots of problem with loading luggage to the parking area. Food was averga and service was not up to the standard. Value for money",Sreekumar N,/Profile/SreekumarN39,"Kochi (Cochin), India",30
haridwar,"It's a nice little place in Haridwar, perfect for a layover. We were in hotel Thakur ji for 1 day and it served its purpose. It's around half a km from the railway station located in narrow bylines. The prices are economical, rooms are clean with clean toilets, good bedsheets and towels. They also provide complimentary breakfast. Overall satisfied stay and exceeded my expectations. ",Dr_Zenith,/Profile/Dr_Zenith,"Bengaluru, India",40
