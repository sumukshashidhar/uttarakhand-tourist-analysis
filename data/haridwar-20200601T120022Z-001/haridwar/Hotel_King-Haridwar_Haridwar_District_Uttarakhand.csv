AC was switched off at midnight. parking facility was not available inside the hotel as told at the time of booking. no proper water supply in the morning .TV was not working properly.

haridwar,"my 3rd time here I do not change my opinion; took friends this time and was most welcomed, everything we ask was no trouble and manager very kind and helpful. The message here is that a hotel is not a building ony, It is the HOspitality in HOTEL that counts, Room was well aired, clean, enjoyable and good condition for older guest house, hot water was on whenever we asked but manager gave great help, he actually allowed us to have hot water OFF but in return he gave AC ON even tho we book non AC price.  This is a place that understands service concept for tourist, but of course it helps if tourist also understands about Indian traveler tips; if you want ""oil"" like door hinge, must ""squeak"" for attention... ask and ye shall receive. tx again Hotel King.",TheBeeMan,/Profile/TheBeeMan,"Nambour, Australia",30

Advance payment:-  it was clearly mentioned in the website that they will not take any advance,  when you will reach the hotel then pay the advance,   but after booking a call will come to you for advance payment,  if you Will not pay the advance your booking will not be confirmed.  Other hotels are very near of hotel king:-  hotel classic is very cheap and good ,  room charges is 900/- and hotel king's charges is 1600/-.

haridwar,"Not the best hotel definitely not a King, Rooms not the cleanest, dirty bedding, wifi so slow it's unusable, room service is a joke they say you will have your order in half hour then half hour later they call and what you ordered is unavailable as the food gets cooked at another place and bought to the hotel, there is no restaurant at hotel as advertised, when you want hot water you have to ask to have it turned on then get enough for a two minute shower, it's not wort wasting your time or money on",Darren C,/Profile/M8732OBdarrenc,,10

haridwar,I stayed here with family for 2 nights and it seems to be a good budget hotel. It can improve on room service and cleanliness. When we checked in there was no drinking water in the room.

haridwar,"Hotel King is an older style budget hotel in an old area. Overall the hotel was clean, aircon worked very well, supply of hot water was also good although only bucket shower. It is within easy walking distance to the railway and bus stations (5 - 10 minutes). Staff were helpful with directions to some events and wifi worked pretty well, too. It got a bit noisy during the day which many Indian hotels do but was quiet during the night. There are many small eateries and shops within a couple of minutes' walk and I had no trouble finding breakfast, lunch or dinner.

haridwar,I had booked A/C room as i was here to stay in this hotel for mere 6 hours .. The location is very confusing and take some time to reach ..... got the room in third floor which can be tirefull for aged people.. The rooms are ok considering the rate what u are paying...... took the ganga snan and came back to room at 9 in night and believe me the A/C didnot work at all as power failure is major issue in haridwar and this hotel have generator which is some other place so when there is power cut someone goes and starts the generator which takes time and your sleep would defintely be disturbed... And when the power comes back again the generator goes off and withing 5 minutes the power cut is mandatory so starting the generator is major issue for this hotel ....

haridwar,"1. If you are selecting a delux room, it is your luck that you will get your AC in working stage.  2. Light may go 3 to 4 times in night or day.  3. Once light will go, you will have to turn you AC on again. This is the very good thing as when you will be in your sleep ,light will go, and you will become in situation of without AC.  4 Do not expect an Extra Bed, in extra bed. Extra bed means extra mattresses not EXTRA BED.  4. You may feel smell as well when romm will be allocated to you.  My suggestion DO NOT TRY THIS HOTEL.",avintechno,/Profile/avintechno,,10

haridwar,King hotel is good Hotel in Haridwar City however it is not the Best. Haridwar is a small town so can't expect much.   +Parking: Hotel having Parking facility however it is limited to 4-5 Cars but i had good experience & was able to get parking in proper manner. Please try to go from Jassa Ram Market side to Hotel if you are going with Own Vehicle as other side is very congested.  +Food Quality: Food quality is good however it is costly as compare to outside at Haridwar. Eating Food outside will be good as per my choice as many restaurants are available nearby.  +Location: Hotel is located at Jassa Ram road which is around 2 KMs from Har ki Paudi. That is an advantage.,Mohitwork,/Profile/Mohitwork,"Noida, India",40

For sightseeing, I would advice not to take a cab from the hotel. Their charges are a lot more than what you could get outside...  The only thing real close to the hotel is the railway station and a street full Gujarati food stalls...some of those have some yummy items with really economical prices....  They have no elevators so choose your rooms wisely. Service was fine, rooms and toilets clean...  Location - a bit tough to find but asking around helps... Budget hotel, don't expect any luxuries...
