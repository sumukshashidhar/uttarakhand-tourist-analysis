haridwar,"I stayed for one night in this hotel. The reception is very courteous. they respect the tourists. Room are very clean and all amenities. Location is excellent. Walkable from Railway/Bus station ,Har ki padi etc. Located in the central location so market , public transport etc is very near. Room service excellent. Very safe and comfortable for family trip also . Rates are reasonable. Very peaceful , good quality of sleep.Only draw back is there is no lift facility and most of the rooms are in first floor upward. recommend to stay there ....thanks",anil_173,/Profile/anil_173,"Bhopal, India",50
