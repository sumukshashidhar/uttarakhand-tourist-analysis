haridwar,Not worth visiting. 1.Aweful smelling washrooms didnt give deos even after request. 2.Inaccessible by vehicle.the staff told on phone that transport is easily available from Kotwali but no auto /rickshaw prepared to go to hotel.3.Purposely kept the complimentary breakfast time late (start 8.30pm) to spare themselves the botheration-refused to make it earlier even by 15mins.

haridwar,1. The entrance to the hotel is very bad. The entrance for Mansa Devi is near to the hotel. So morning time the entrance is heavily crowded. 2. The breakfast buffet is bad. The tea was like small dingy station tea. No taste in buffet food 3. The food ordered in room was bit better. 4. No parking at all. One would need to park personal vehicle almost 2-3 km away. 5. No vehicles allowed within 1 km of hotel due to crowded area. One actually needs to carry their luggage halfway. 6. The people at reception are good and allowed us to stay in the room for an extra hour after check out time.,Sushmita Choudhury,/Profile/473sushmitac,"New Delhi, India",20

Next to Mansadevi Ropeway and about 7-8 minutes walking distance from the main attraction Har-ki-paudi, making it an ideal location for stay. Stayed in 4 bed suite, which is quite big and aptly furnished.  Food quality is good and prepared on order, so please be prepared to wait a little... Best is you get tava rotis, which gives it a homely feel...People there are eager to please you and serve you with a smile. Mr.Deepak Kapoor and Mr.Anup are very courteous and helpful and will ensure that your stay is comfortable.",Sunil R,/Profile/SunilR703,"New Delhi, India",40

haridwar,I with 12 of my family members reached Haridwar on 20th April 2013 in the morning at 4am at Haridwar station. We reached hotel Raj Mandir and to my surprise we were greeted so well at the reception in the morning 4:30 and we had helper boys in these morning hours also to pick our bags till the rooms and give us all the facilities like water etc.  We all really liked the rooms given to us. Only the train voice used to come for 10-30 secs sometimes otherwise the location of this hotel is really very nice. It is just next to Mansa Devi temple entrance.  In the morning we had a bath at the holy Ganges at Har Ki Paudi.  Hotel Raj Mandir is very near to the market yet a little away to enjoy the peaceful stay.  We also got great help by the hotel owner Mr. Deepak who arranged for the,NavinLahori,/Profile/NavinLahori,Pune,50
haridwar,"I stayed at this hotel with my parents and wife for a week. Its a really good at a very good location. It is located next to Mansa Devi ropeway and around half kilometre from Harki Pauri Ghat. The hotel is kept clean and has very courteous staff. Given the quality of rooms, I must say that the price which was provided was quite reasonable. When we asked for, they provided us with cabs at reasonable rates too. On the second evening of my stay, I fell ill due to food poisoning because of food I ate at a food stall in Rishikesh. Late night, they arranged for a car and one of the managers drove us to the hospital, stayed there with us for the entire duration (couple of hours) and took us back to the hotel. That was a very nice gesture. The quality of food was good but a little",SharadRaj,/Profile/SharadRaj,Hyderabad,50
haridwar,located close to mansa devi..but bit far from the bus and railway station..this place is a good option when you want to stay in connection with the main city..there are definitely better options but then they are faraway..u can reach the local markets n restaurants by walking down on your own..staff is helpful..hot water supply is not 24 x 7 but the helpful staff efforts their best to make you have it when you need it !! restaurant is ok..room services are quite prompt when asked for.. in all a good option to stay in the city !! :),wittytweety,/Profile/wittytweety,"Dehradun, India",30
haridwar,"I met a friend here post afternoon of exploring and the food was excellent and the staff very attentive. So my review is limited to the lovely repast in the dining room. We didn't stay in the rooms, but we viewed them and they were very clean. Just judging from the aspect of the building, I would be sure to ask for the quiet side of the building if I stayed there.",FriendstobeMade,/Profile/FriendstobeMade,Monmouth OR,40

haridwar,"i stayed here in the last weekend of may... the only positive thing about this hotel was the general manager...a gentleman who seemed to help...otherwise i am extremely disappointed with this hotel. firstly when i booked the hotel , i checked to see if they accept credit cards and i was told..YES WE DO...so i carried just enough cash..but when it was time to checkout...began the real drama....they said the credit card machine has been out of service for quite sometime....WHAT THE HELL...i tried to tell them ...but the staff didnt seem to bother to listen....i had to borrow some cash from my friends to pay the bill...in all a terrible experience...So anyone hoping to pay in this hotel by card...BEWARE...  the food was gud in the hotel...but it took ages to delivery....really",venu0205,/Profile/venu0205,"Noida, India",10
haridwar,"Was told that this was a new hotel and decided to stay here due to its proximity to Hari ki Pauri. Unfortunately, this hotel completely failed to live up to expectations.   First I was given a room where the bed clearly wasn't made. The bedsheets and pillow cases were completely soiled and brown. There were strands of hair strewn all over the bed. When I checked the bathroom it had a steely-moist smell. I realised that it was because the plumber had missed out connecting the wash basing to the drain outlet. So every time one used the basin water (and dirty at that!) would splash all over the bathroom. I gave the housekeeping boy a piece of my mind and he was in the process of changing my bed. But as I kept discovering one problem after another, the only real option was to change",Aamadmo,/Profile/Aamadmo,"Bengaluru, India",20
haridwar,"I recommend this hotel to everyone visiting Haridwar. This is adjoining Mansa Devi Ropeway and 500 meters from Har Ki Pauri. This is a new hotel opened in Febraury'2012. You can imagine the condition of a newly built flat, the room was perfect . Even, you can smell the polish on wood work because they are recently constructed. You cannot get such clean rooms so near to har Ki Pauri because of highly toursit populated area in Haridwar. Slightly costlier, but you can negotiate hard to get good discount. They can even arrange your vehicle to enter the barrier and have parking facility of approx. 8 cars.  Only negative is the room service, bit slow during two orders out of 8 orders but fast on other 6.",VinayChawla,/Profile/VinayChawla,India,40
