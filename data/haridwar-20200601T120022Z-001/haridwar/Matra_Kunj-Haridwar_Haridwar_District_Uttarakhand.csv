haridwar,"I would rate matra kunj excellent . It is well located in a quiet neighbourhood, yet close enough to the main road. The food,  was very tasty and well priced. I appreciate the caring and compassion that the staff showed towards my elderly   we could stay on the first floor without any difficulty. Our room was clean and well maintained. The hotel provided our driver with a free dormitory which was really convenient. I would highly recommend  matra kunj  to travellers who are looking for a clean, decent place to stay when they visit Haridwar. I will stay here again on my next visit!",raghavhw,/Profile/raghavhw,india,50
