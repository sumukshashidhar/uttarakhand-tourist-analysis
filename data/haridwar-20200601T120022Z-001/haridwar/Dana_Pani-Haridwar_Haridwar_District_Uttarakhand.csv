haridwar,"The good was tasty though bit oily but 5he Roti was really amazing as good as home made.  The value for money is very good and I would surely go again as the variety of cuisine is good.  To clarify, they serve a bottle of water without ordering that's seems complementary but is actually charged.  Worth a visit.",ManishMax,/Profile/ManishMax,"Nairobi, Kenya",30
haridwar,The hotel is very okish...located just besides the Jain temple in bhupatwala area. I visited in search of jain food ... But unfortunately it only served bland tasteless panner paratha in jain food....and charged Rs 60 per paratha. At haridwar jain food is a problem... This restaurant at least serves something in d name of jain food. ,karishmashah222,/Profile/karishmashah222,"Mumbai, India",20
