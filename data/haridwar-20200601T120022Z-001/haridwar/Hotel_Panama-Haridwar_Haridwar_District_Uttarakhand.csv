haridwar,"We did not stay here because we did not feel comfortable about the level cleanliness in this hotel. Based on the previous reviews, we decided to go to this hotel and ask for a room. When the staff showed us one room, the sheets and pillows were dirty, bathroom not very well maintained, so we refused to stay. Then, they showed us another room and it was pretty much the same. The staff members were polite though. I guess it is ok for someone who doesnt care about cleanliness too much.",Tomash226,/Profile/Tomash226,"Bratislava, Slovakia",20
