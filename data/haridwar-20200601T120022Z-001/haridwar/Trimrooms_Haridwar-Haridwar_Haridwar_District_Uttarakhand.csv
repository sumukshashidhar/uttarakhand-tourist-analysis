haridwar,"Average hotel, about 5 Kms from Har Ki Pouri, rooms spacious and clean, no restaurant ar the hotel.... a makeshift arrangement on the terrace and that too very costly. Checkout time is 12 noon, if you overstay by 2 hours or so, hotel will charge you full day's rate. Overall average, you can get better options at lesser cost.

haridwar,"We were supposed to spend 2 nights in this place but we quickly changed our minds and decided to shorten our stay.  First the hotel is situated far from any interesting places. Then many things indicate that the hotel is still under construction : no WiFi, no common area : we had to take our dinner (order from what the hotel called its “restaurant”, clearly not a good value for money) in the bed of our tiny room... At first we thought the room was clean : it was before we took a look under the bed and realized it was full of rubbish (cf picture attached) We were also tricked because the pictures of the rooms when we booked showed one window behind a curtain : it is nothing more than a window to a dark internal area ...  We also were suffocating in the room since too many power",RomGal,/Profile/RomGal,"Paris, France",20
