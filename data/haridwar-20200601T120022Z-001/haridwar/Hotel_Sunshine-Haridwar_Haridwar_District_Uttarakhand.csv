Strictly NO for those who can not climb up stairs, because this hotel doesn't have lift service.

It was old model, the box size which the temperature setting wasn't working well and it was noisy. Balcony was small but good.   The hotel doesn't have restaurant but do provide room service, kitchen situated at top floor.

They took our reservation while they were doing the remodelling. The two room we rented did not have window door and it was freezing during the night. Hotel did not disclose any of this. Bathroom was not well maintained. Lot of leaking pipes were noted . It appears that the hotel management do not review the room thoroughly before they hand out this room to us.

The owner doesn't own the responsibility - it is laundry's responsibility, or staffs, or customers...  I called it quits in a day (though I had a booking for 3 days) and they insisted on me paying for 3 days. The staff and owner tried to trick me with 'good cop, bad cop' act.

haridwar,"The city is full of lodges ranging from poor to bad. Sad infrastructure, poor hygiene is the hallmark of this pilgrimage centre. The nonstop influx of tourists means that those who have property are the rulers. Sunshin Lodge is located right in the busiest part of Haridwar. If you are here on a pilgrimage, you are well served. The handicap is that the hotel is on a non-motorable road. If u have luggage that is heavy, u have a problem. If you are in your own car, keep away from this hotel. Rooms are run down, but not filthy. When the whole city is terribly short on hygiene, your standards of expectation fall.

The sheets were visibly dirty, the window didn't even have a glass, so we could hear everything in the outside (there was just a grid for mosquitoes, and there was only a small window for the whole room), the food wasn't great, people entered our room without even knocking on the door, and we saw two huge cockroaches (one of them on a bed, luckily they gave us a triple bedroom for two people, so we didn't have to sleep there).

haridwar,"The hotel is very internally located in congested lanes of Moti Bazaar. The hotel's location has both pros and cons.   Best part of this hotel is - It is conveniently located near Har-Ki-Pauri (5 mins walk-able distance). One can reach to take a holy dip at the Ganges or take a holy view of the Aarti at tha ghats in no time. The ropeway station of the Mansa Devi Temple is also at a walk-able distance.  We took a 4 bedded family deluxe room which had AC, Geyser and TV etc. The room and toilet were averagely cleaned. Though little congested but manageable.  Staff were very helpfull and cheerful.  They have a kitchen aslo and food quality and price is too good and economical.  We hired a cab to visit Rishikesh and Haridwar local site seeing through the hotel travel desk.

haridwar,"I booked this Hotel through online Inquiry, Trip Adviser review. I booked Three bed Single room because I came with my mom and wife to visit this Holy Place on Kartik Month. No doubt it is good hotel. But when I reached there then luckily I couldn't get my room which I booked. I said 'Luckily' because really that three bed room was very congested. Any way that room was occupied by another tourist , and they extend their trip. So Hotel management offer us one double bed Room witch was more bigger then three bed room :). But Hotel Guy Krishna who was soft spoken provided us an extra mattress on floor :(. Any way we adjusted because we don't want to get into any argument. I was suffering from fever. Hotel Cook was very good. I like the cook service. trip was going good until we",arun_sh,/Profile/arun_sh,"Mumbai, India",30
haridwar,This is a pretty neat and clean hotel with a very good service. Though we stayed only for a night but hotel staff was very courteous and helpful. Never expected such good quality rooms in haridwar so this was a pleasant surprise for us. Though the approach is not so great but once you are in hotel then you are away from the hustle and bustle of Haridwar. Lift in the hotel was a boon as my parents cannot climb stairs. Very good hotel at the price it charges.,anoopjain72,/Profile/anoopjain72,"Bengaluru, India",40

haridwar,"The hotel is well situated, no doubt. But that's about all actually. Prices are far too high for what you receive in cleanness and servis. The manager is unfriendly in every concern. The staff is like a bunch of monkey that don't know how to behave. When I wanted to close the door of the roof, because I did't feel comfortable by having FIVE guys standing outside to bring me my passport, one of the pushed against the door, so that I could close it... Roomservice not available and manager just hung up the phone when I asked what time the cook would be back.  Very disappointing experience!",travelforgood10,/Profile/travelforgood10,Delhi,20
haridwar,its a clean budget hotel with good service. very near to ganga. situated within the main bazaar. can be a little tricky to find out. over all a good value for money. we went at the time of kumbh mela with elder members of the family. front desk was very well behaved. everybody liked it. don't expect anything fancy. this is a very basic but comfortable place. plus u can reach the har pauri in no time at all.,silva s,/Profile/s_sarkardas,"Kolkata, India",40
