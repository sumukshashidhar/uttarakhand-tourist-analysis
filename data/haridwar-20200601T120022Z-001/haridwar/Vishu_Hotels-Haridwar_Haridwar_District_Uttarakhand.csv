haridwar,"I stayed in this hotel in July 2015 in AC room. The bed were full of BEDBUG, even we didn't slept whole night. When we told staff to change the room, they said you can leave the hotel, on that day the time was at 11 PM (Midnight). I have very bad experience. Bigggggggggggg no to stay in this hotel. My Suggestion: Please check the bed condition physically before select the room in any hotel except 5 star hotel. Don't compromise with cleanliness. It may ruin your trip experience",Sagar404,/Profile/Sagar404,"New Delhi, India",10
