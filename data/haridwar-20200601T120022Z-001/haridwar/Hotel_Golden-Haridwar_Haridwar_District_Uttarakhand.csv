haridwar,"Booked it on go ibibo for 300 rupees for a non AC room. Since it's cold ,so no need of a fan or air conditioning. Rooms are good size and neat and clean . Only issue hot water not available. Staff is co operative ",Vipin Arora,/Profile/vipina776,"Lucknow, India",40
haridwar,"I had a bad feeling from the moment we arrived but decided to ignore that because of it's location. The guy who was operating the reception failed to acknowledge me, staying in his phone and when he finished his phone call still didn't acknowledge me. Another younger guy came in and I asked him about my booking but he didn't understand. I asked the first guy and he didnt give me a clear answer about whether there was a room available for us (we had booked on booking.com) I asked many times, do you have a room and he eventually nodded by I wasn't certain. He finally got some keys and after showing him the booking reference he took me to a room. It seemed OK for what we were paying so I agreed to it. The price was 1000 rupees for two nights and he said, but you give me 1050. We",africatraveller15,/Profile/africatraveller15,"Zanzibar Archipelago, Tanzania",10
haridwar,"The night we spent in Hotel golden was the worst we had in a month in india so far :  - At our arrival, after 14 hours of train, 5 men were sitting in the lobby on their phones which is usually what you can find in any hotel, but in this case one of them stood up to ""welcome"" us and start the check in without a ""hello"" ""good evening"" or anything that would ressemble a proper welcome, the only thing he said was ""booking number"", the 4 other guys stayed there comfortably installed in the sofas looking at my girlfriend like a piece of meat. The manager then came out of nowhere, didn't tell them to go away turned to us and simply said : ""booking id ?"".  - after all that we were acompanied to the room which was dirty, we slept in village hotel down in rajhastan for 300 RS a night",Alan,/Profile/alanaS1398WT,,10
haridwar,"Good experience with Hotel Golden. This hotel is good in terms of budget. Front desk representative behavior was also good. If I visit here again, I would like to stay in this hotel.

haridwar,"Booked 4 BedRoom  AC room, however founded Madhumakkhi Chatta in the room and need to Adjust in 3 Room set. The size of Room is Ok but no view from room and cant see anything out of the room. I read that Har ki Pauri is in walking distance, literally Yes but its 40 mins walk only. No Wifi Facility, market is approachable. But it is budgeted hotel and staff is friendly. Just pay little extra and book hotel somewhere else in Haridwar. The best thing is Parking Facility is Available and nearby to the railway station.",shanky2372,/Profile/shanky2372,"Chandigarh, India",30
haridwar,"We chose this hotel because we want to stay near Haridwar Railway station and bus stand. The AC room was exactly the same as shown in the photo. We faced no problem here. If you want to go to Kankhal, you can easily get shared auto in front of this hotel.",Niya1315,/Profile/Niya1315,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
haridwar,"a decent but old property, though poorly maintained, yet is value for money as rooms are clean, especially AC rooms,  bathrooms also are just acceptable,,,,  Good thing about hotel is that it is just 1 minute walk away from railway station...  and there is lot of economic eating options around it.....  Lack of parking space is another problem....",KrishnAshish,/Profile/KrishnAshish,"Jalandhar, India",30
haridwar,"Stayed here for a day in July, 2016. Had booked this hotel on MMT. Was given room no. 105 which was full of foul smell coming out from the attached toilet. On being pointed out the concerned person came with room freshener but in vain. Then my room was changed to 104 which had indian toilet, it was less smelly and the stench was controlled /suppressed with room spray. The mini TV was hardly operation. Anyhow passed time, left the hotel in the evening. had we to spend for night, it would certainly been a nightmare. Only plus point is its location which is at walking distance from the Rly. Stn. and many more eateries.",Ratnesh M,/Profile/ratnesh045,"New Delhi, India",10

haridwar,Nice stay. Parking in front of the hotel gate. A bit far from Har ki Pauri. But very close to Railway station. Good for those who can walk much and want cheap and best accommodation. Didn't try hotel's food but there are lots of good restaurants nearby.,Harsh M,/Profile/HarshM256,,40
haridwar,"The AC rooms are good, however, the non ac ones are stuffy and unfit to stay. The centralized location is the only plus point. Its just a five minute walk from the railway station. Auto rickshaws and e rickshaws are easily available, so there is no transportation and conveyance problem",ankitachandra89,/Profile/ankitachandra89,"Allahabad, India",30
haridwar,"Nice hotel very close to Haridwar Jn. & walking distance from Har Ki Pauri. Cleanliness is good, only disadvantage is no AC, service during power cuts and no lift in the hotel.

haridwar,"I am a frequent traveller and likes to travel a lot with my friends or sometimes even alone. Recently I visited Haridwar and stayed in this hotel. The location of the hotel was very convenient for us as it was situated at walking distance from the railway station. Coming to the hotel, my friend booked a room through an online portal and we got the room at very cheap price. The room was very neat and clean and the bedding was freshly done. The bathroom n all very also very clean with hot water (I cannot take bath without it :D). The staff of the hotel was also very polite to us and met all our demands satisfactorily. All in all it a really good experience for us at such affordable price and I would recommend this hotel to all budget travelers.

haridwar,the hotel golden was very bakwas and staff member wwere very rude. I would not suggest to anyone to stay there. My expereince was trrible and never to stay this hotel. Staff members behaviour were very rude.,609ashutosht,/Profile/609ashutosht,Mumbai,10
haridwar,I visited haridwar with family last year and booked this hotel for a night. The hotel is said to have 24 hrs power back up.. and to prove the same they have planted a generator just outside hotel. I only required hotel for night stay as I reached there from Delhi in evening and planned to return by next day noon. There was a power problem and we suffered the entire night. They started generator for 10 min and then switched it off for 30 min.. and kept repeating the same till morning. I did book a 2 x double bed AC room for a family of 4 for the sake of good sleep at night.. but hotel's irresponsible and non customer centric behaviour made me drivr back till Delhi with sleepy eyes.  Not at all recommended.,Akhilesh K,/Profile/375akhileshk,,10
haridwar,"Location was good, less than 1 km from railway station. Room was neat and clean. bed sheets and pillow covers were also clean. Hot water was available.  But mosquitoes were there during night, still no coils or mats were provided.              ",Saroj P,/Profile/SarojPanigrahy,Udaipur,40
haridwar,Big USP for this hotel is its location and proximity to the railway station and bus stand along with the ghats of Ganges. Rooms are of decent quality and very affordable. The staff is helpful and they assisted our family to go around in Haridwar.  Overall if you are looking for budget options with proximity to all major visiting places ib Haridwar then would highly recommend this hotel.,Chetan1023,/Profile/Chetan1023,"Bengaluru, India",40
haridwar,Hotel location is very good. Railway station and bus stand are at walking distance. Temples are also nearby.Room service is very good and its a perfect place to stay at reasonable price.

haridwar,"Plus: Near Railway station. Minus: Mosquitoes everywhere in the room! Eventhough we stayed in AC room, it had several holes where Mosquitoes could enter easily. Hotel is very close to the main road and one can hear vehicle honking noise and other noises from the street. We could not get proper sleep. There is no lift, so hard to carry luggage, if you get rooms on higher floor(s). Hotel manager was rude and it was really hard to get towels/soap or any other support from him. I do not recommend this hotel.",vprasad_k2k2,/Profile/vprasad_k2k2,"Bengaluru, India",20
haridwar,"Its good Hotel, i stay here several times almost once in a month, this hotel has very close to Haridwar Junction, Hotel staff is also very Good, Rooms are neat and clean , Food quality is not very Good, it is also Walking distance from Ganga Ghat, Lots of Shop , Tea Stall is available near by. In simple word its a Good Hotel, But one thing i want to suggest never book any Hotel from Clear Trip, although i am regular customer for Clear Trip, but this is most non cooperative and rude customer care, this time i was unable to reach this hotel due to an serious accident, i made a request to Clear Trip, that please cancel this booking and return atleast 50% amount, but they did not help me. take this thing in mind always. wish you a happy journey.",Subodh K,/Profile/SUBODHK447,Bareilly,40
haridwar,It was totally different from my expectation and what I have seen in clear trip. It was too far from the ghat. Tavelling to the ghat cost the same if I book any other hotel. There was only two persons in the hotel              ,Vimlesh K,/Profile/VimleshK,Noida,30
haridwar,"As i had my return ticket to delhi booked in Janshatabdi which leaves Haridwar early in the morning i preferrd to book a hotel near railway station and that ultimately lead me to hotel golden..i booked one 4 bed ac room @1200/- for 2 nights which was cheap i thought... At a distance of hardly 5 minutes from the station the hotel looked ok from outside, the reception area was small, the stairs to the 1st floor were narrow..the room was ok, walls were not well painted, a little more illumination was what required, didnt use the ac so cant talk about that, no intercom, dont have restaurant so if you want food they will get it for you from outside, we didnt try that..room service was also not upto the mark...in addition to this the attitude of the hotel staff was very irritating..we",Som_D82,/Profile/Som_D82,"Haldia, India",20
haridwar,"Very decent place, clean and comfortable beds, TV, AC, friendly and helpful staff. The only bad thing is windows and AC don't fit very well so it's a bit noisy from the street below till late at night. Location is great if you have a train to catch - station is 4-5 min walking distance. Otherwise if you plan to visit central part of Haridwar is probably 30-35 minutes walking through nice areas near the river :)",Ivo D,/Profile/IvoD_11,"Sofia, Bulgaria",50
