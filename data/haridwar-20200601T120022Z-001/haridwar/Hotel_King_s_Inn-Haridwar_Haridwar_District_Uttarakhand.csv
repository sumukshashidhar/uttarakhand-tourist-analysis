haridwar,This property is good for friends and family. It may be little bit far from the city but it is very much peaceful. Staff is very good and friendly. They can give you all the information about the city and place. Food is really good.,garhwaliya,/Profile/garhwaliya,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
