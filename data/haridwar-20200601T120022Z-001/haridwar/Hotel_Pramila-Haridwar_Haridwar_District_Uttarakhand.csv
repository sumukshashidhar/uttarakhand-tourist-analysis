haridwar,Worest service.  Worest quality of food. Food was cooked several hour before and kept for buffet which was difficult to be taken. No further action was taken even after repetitive request and esclation to manager. Behavior of staff and manager was not convincing towards customer.,Saurabh,/Profile/Shivansh1104,,10

haridwar,"Nothing good nothing bad all things are average in this hotel, staff is polite and location is good, easy to locate on the main national highway, they can also serve food in late hours on demand but not very tasty.",ananyafrp,/Profile/ananyafrp,"Jaipur, India",30

The rates are also reasonable.  I would recommend this hotel for better stay.",badri,/Profile/badri4819,"Noida, India",30
haridwar,"To be honest, i can Â´t believe any of the previous commentary, this hotel is just horrible and worth no more than 300 rps for a night ( i paid aroud 20 usd).  Rooms are very old, beds are hard, sheets contains stains, bathroom was totaly moist with mold spore everywhe on the wall, no hot water at all (exept on a bucket), tv was not a flat screen at all but a big old crt tv with really bad quality image and so many interference it make it totaly unwatchable. Also no internet at all even on reception floor, i mean no wifi network! Also at first the wire from AC were hanging on the ground... There was also a no working fridge in front of the terrasse door but better not open it anyway cause they throw there all their garbage.  When I said on the night manager i was totally unhappy",Yann54,/Profile/Yann54,"Bruxelles, Belgique",10
haridwar,"I along with my family arrived this hotel on September 29th morning around 8:00am. There was an excellent welcome, upon arriving we found ourselves in a valley of smiles and the hotel allowed us to check in early without additional charge. The stay was really nice and so is the staff, in the end I was almost sorry to leave. It was a nice & clean hotel. Basically there's not a lot of choice for hotels in HARIDWAR, so this one offers a pretty good all round service for the price. The best thing about Hotel Pramila is its location. It's in a really good location for getting to the HARI KI PAUDI, MANSA DEVI TEMPLE, CHANDI DEVI TEMPLE & RAILWAY STATION.   These are the things that made me enjoy my stay at this hotel, but my warmest congratulations to the hotel for their choice of",DrAnand Pratap S,/Profile/DrAnandPratapSingh,"Lucknow, India",50

haridwar,We stayed at Hotel Pramila for 2 nights in this june. The hotel staff were extremely pleasant the rooms were clean and the food  in the restaurnt was good specially the Indian dishes were great. Tge main reason for our trip wad the evening ganga aarti at HarKi Paudi and the hotel is conveniently located for this. They also provide your Driver's accomodation and his food. We also got to usr the free wifi internet as it was setting up at that time not sure if it's free now or not. Overall I would recommend staying here as it offers a good clean standard of accomodation and at a reasonable price of 2500 rupees a night with a discount of 20%.,dinesh_chd,/Profile/dinesh_chd,,50

haridwar,"Room was too humid, noisy, cold. Not enough parking spaces at the hotel. Room service was saying 24 hrs. but there was no room service early in the morning for coffee or tea. Room was not clean as per international travelling standards. There is much other choices for same price. The place is also away from Ganga and Har Ki Pauri - the main attractions of the city",shokar,/Profile/shokar,"Vancouver, Canada",20
