haridwar,"There was no room available in Haridwar on the day of our visit and our room was arranged by a noted influential person.  The Manager, Mr. Manish is a wonderful person and whatever help he could provide was provided during our stay.  They have large double bed rooms with AC and attached bathroom.  The hotel is just average and is OK for just a night or for transit stay.  There are lot of eating places like Ann Jal or  chotiwala to eat food and snacks nearnby. HarKi paudi is just 10 minute by auto at a very small price.",aggarwalrka,/Profile/aggarwalrka,"Chandigarh, India",30
