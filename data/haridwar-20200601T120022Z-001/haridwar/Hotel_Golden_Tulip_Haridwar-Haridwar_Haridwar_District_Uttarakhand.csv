haridwar,Visited here for two nights at end Feb 2020. Location is on main road and so can be noisy with trucks driving by.  Bathroom and room was good. Bed sheets were not clean.  WiFi was not reliable at all and very frustrating.   Food in restaurant was good. Hence three stars.,Sanj46,/Profile/Sanj46,"London, England",30

haridwar,The hotel is good and the rooms are spacious. I went to the hotel as part of a package on a business trip. The staff is OK and could be better trained. The food is fine and needs to be improved.

We cancelled our booking from another hotel as regenta had pool n spa and we were accompanied by children but upon reaching we were rold pool is not functional .

haridwar,"Had been there with family but shocked to find out swimming pool & gym was not operational. I was in constant touch with Mr.Himanshu for booking since last 7 days before arriving the facility,but he never mentioned that pool & gym is not operational. My child was very excited about swimming and take swimsuit along with her. I also thought of using the gym but both are closed. I had highlighted the matter to Mr. Singh (General Manager of the hotel) but seems they are more concerned with business than client's satisfaction. My simple question is, if the hotel is publishing certain facilities and we are paying accordingly, isn't the responsibility of the hotel to inform client that certain facility is not available? They don't even offer any discount for the same. Is that not",joydeep8,/Profile/joydeep8,"New Delhi, India",20

They were really well prepared however the the South Indian cuisine in breakfast was saddening.  The rooms were good and big. We had a very traumatic experience taking bath. The outlets were chocked and the bathroom turned swimming pool, aargghh...they were not swift to address the situation. Not happy. ",ShankhaSubhra,/Profile/ShankhaSubhra,"New Delhi, India",30

The pool area is peaceful and beautiful and a great feeling to relax and chat and the staff leave you alone and don't intrude.

haridwar,"It was a short stay for an unplanned visit. The hotel is located in very peaceful setting on Haridwar - Dehradoon road, about  5-6 kms from main city. Rooms were clean and spacious. Although clean the bath rooms weren't well maintained. The taps, shower  etc. were not functioning as they meant to. Basic stuffs like dental kits, comb and shaving kits were not offered.  Breakfast was OK, this may be because of very low occupancy at that time due to lean season (a day before Diwali) the items were very limited but taste was reasonably good.

To my horror on the first morning waking up my brother saw a rat the size of a cat going through our snack and disappear in a gap in the closet...yes a rat!  We complained about the room and we're given another which was nicer reason we didn't leave immediately was because the surrounding environment is like a zoo anyway with cows, dogs, monkeys, goats anyway so gave the benefit of doubt. Best thing about this hotel was the food. Hats off to the chef who seems to be carrying this hotel on his shoulders. Food was amazing.

We arrived on a Friday afternoon and found the hotel essentially empty of guests.  The staff are wonderfully trained and are very helpful and courteous. After check-in, we went dined in the hotel. The food here is made to order and was seasoned to taste ( low salt requested) and the five lentil dahl was wonderful with the ghee rice.  Our room (305) faced the road--as is the case for most roads in India, there were the occasional honks of horns. However, as we are in India a great deal of the time, the noise was not at all an issue. We were able to safely cross the road numerous times as it is often empty.
