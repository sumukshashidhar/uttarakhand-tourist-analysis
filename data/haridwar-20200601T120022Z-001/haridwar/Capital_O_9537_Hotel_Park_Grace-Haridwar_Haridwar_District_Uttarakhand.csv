haridwar,We had very comfortable stay. The room was very good so was the room service. The hotel is well located and view from window was scenic. Food quality was great both during dinner and breakfast. The staff was friendly and helpful. I will recommend the hotel with confidence to my friends.,sridipha,/Profile/sridipha123,,50
haridwar,Bathrooms were disgusting. Hot water was not available. Cupboards were not cleaned. Service is very slow. Didn't prepare the breakfast which was agreed. Staff wasn't available to carry luggage while checking out.,shriram k,/Profile/shrink1002,,10
haridwar,"During our visit to haridwar and rishikesh we stayed in this hotel, Actually Hotel, Property, Rooms, Reception, Restaurant, etc made very good but the main problem is they are not maintaining it properly because of non availability of good staff. Careless in maintenance of Electronics items, cleaning, service etc.",Manish D,/Profile/manishd315,,30
