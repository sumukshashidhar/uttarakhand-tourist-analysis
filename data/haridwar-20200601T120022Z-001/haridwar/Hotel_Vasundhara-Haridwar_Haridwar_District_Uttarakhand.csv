haridwar,"I visited here in Oct 2019, I booked my rooms in advanced but when I reached there rooms was not clean. After my request sweeper cleaned the room. It was not a good experience. But staff members were polite.",Richi S,/Profile/RichiS65,,50
haridwar,"Avoid if you are planning the trip with your family. Manager is illiterate and don't know a little bit about management. Some others pending bills will be added in your account and you will forced to pay that before leaving the hotel, otherwise they will threat you........",Faruq,/Profile/Faruksheikh91,,10
haridwar,Try to avoid if you are booking online. Demand 500rs for early check in. Also added 2000rs for stay even after pre payment through yatra.com without any reason. Also charged for food without even order anything (fixed price). Worst experience ever. Also harassed in front of others if argue with them.,Krishan,/Profile/KrishanMondal,,10

Spacious & clean rooms & bathrooms.  2.

Staffs are polite & decent and know how to talk to customers. Very well-behaved & friendly 4. One can book this hotel by paying a minimum amount.

haridwar,The hotel is very near to Mansa Devi temple roapway. On the main upper road. Only drawback is you can't reach by vehicle as it is on the main market road. Staff are very helpful and rooms are neat and clean. Very near to har ki pouri. Can give 4.5 stars,Srikanth R,/Profile/SrikanthR334,,40
haridwar,"We stayed here with family for 2 nights and were impressed with the value for money that one can get.  Pros :The deluxe AC rooms are spacious and clean. The staff is very friendly and always ready to offer help. The corridors are large enough for kids to play around. The rooms are big and interior furniture are well maintained. The location is very close to Har Ki Pauri, one can enjoy wlaking upto Har Ki pauri through main market shopping.  Lots of north Indian and one south Indian food joints and restaurants are nearby.  Cons : The common parking area of cars is about 400 metres from hotel. On Har Ki Pauri road, the vehicles are not allowed between 7am to 11am on most of days. But one can bring car upto this hotel by offering to keep license with Traffic police for about 15-20",Napoleon K,/Profile/NapoleonKhandelwal,Pune,40

haridwar,"I am amused that Cleatrip is asking me to review this property , a booking for which I apid them in advance and had a confirmation!!!! When my guest reached there, the Hotel had received NO INTIMATION or email from Cleartrip. Not just that, Hotel confirmed that this is teh second time in a short while Cleartrip is doing this blunder. Good lucj if you wish to plan your travel through Cleartrip. Recommend that please call the Hotel few days before you check in!!!",Guy N,/Profile/guyn223,"New Delhi, India",30
haridwar,"Hotel Location is the plus point, just 10 min walking distance from Haur ki pyari ghat and opposite of Manasa Devi Rope way. D block Super deluxe rooms were very well maintained. We visit the place at winter.  Rooms were big spacious and hot water was available for 24 hours. Roof top restaurant was good, pure vegetarian and price was cheap. True value for money for the travelers.",Jeet m,/Profile/Abhijitz_kolkata,,40

haridwar,Hotel Is ok the service is good and Manager Mr .Negi is nice and provides service pretty well. But no hot water is provided in the room you have to order then to take it in bucket.
