haridwar,"Beautiful peaceful place just on from Barkot. Welcoming, helpful and a little bit of an English speaking host.  My father and I mountain biked from near yamamoutri to Dehradun Over four days and stumbled upon this gem!  The family are respectful and humble. Mr Rautela sat with us and conversed in good English. He also showed us a great walk up the hill to the apple orchards and nearby village. The food was super well prices and good quality. Fun family who take great pride in their hotel in paradise.  River and valley views. Great clean spacious rooms with fans.  We would definitely stay here again as it was nice to be out of Barkot and the main villages.
