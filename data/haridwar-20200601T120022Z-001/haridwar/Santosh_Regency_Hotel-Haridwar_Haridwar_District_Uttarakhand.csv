haridwar,"Hotel is located at one of the best location at har ki paudi itself , 5 minutes walk from govt parking.  Booked 2 rooms at  reasonable price , a lot less than what was showing on hotel finding apps.  Rooms arent very large but ok enough.  2 type of rooms are available , ganga facing and not facing .  Try and take ganga facing rooms , view is good during aarti time.  View from room attached in pic",fireonwheels,/Profile/fireonwheels,"New Delhi, India",30
haridwar,We stayed at this hotel for a night. They provide good rates if you bargain hard.The location of the hotel is amazing with great view of the ghats and the Ganges. It was off season and room service was unavailable. Rooms were average sized and clean. Hot water was available from 6.00 am to 11 am. We enjoyed our stay here.,Rulerofsun,/Profile/Rulerofsun,Mumbai,30
