haridwar,"Great location on main street and walking five minutes to main gath for aarti in the evening. Noisy and busy town, maybe you wont relax that much, but for sure exciting experience to be here a couple of nights. The room is quite small but well organized with closet for luggage. A/c, TV, drinking water, Hot water for bath, good WiFi. So everything we needed. All very clean! Would come back.",vitosm2017,/Profile/vitosm2017,Argentina,30
haridwar,"Last month i.e March we planned Haridwar trip and wanted to stay nearby ghat , so after a lot of research found this place.   We wanted a Non Ac room but when I tried to book in the present property it was not available but still the owner ( Rahul Pandey - is very cooperative & considerate and polite too ) gave us an AC room in his other property but due to some family issue had to cancel it.   When again i planned  Haridwar trip this month (April) I called the owner to book because of his such nice nature. But our bad luck Non AC was not available so the owner gave us an AC room (making it Non AC for us) in the present location only. So crux of the matter is there was absolutely no issues in booking.  Now about the property -   Ram Lodge as the name itself explains - 'LODGE'  ",1111asd,/Profile/1111asd,"New Delhi, India",50
haridwar,"This is such a staying option where you can get everything near you except the view of River Ganga. But River Ganga is just 5 minutes walking distance. This hotel is cheap and best for them, whose traveling schedule is tight and who can stay into the market place. But not for those whom need to calm and quite place. But overall the hotel is very good to stay. Hotel stuffs are very cooperative.",Ranajoy S,/Profile/ranajoys990,"Kolkata, India",40
