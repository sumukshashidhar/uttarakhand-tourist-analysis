haridwar,This was our second visit to this property after one year.Though the reception staff was different this time but rest of things remained the same. Staff were very courteous and check in was very fast.   Just like last year we had amazing time in Haridwar and a big thanks to Ganga Lahiri and its dedicated team for the same.Property is very clean and the food served at its restaurant is delicious and hygienic( one thing that we miss at other famous joints in Hadidwar).

The room was good and quieter than we expected (given the common area right outside the rooms). The hotel includes special little touches including musical entertainers in the common area, and chocolates and fruit in the lobby.  Food in the restaurant was very good - we found ourselves eating most meals there.  Note that cars can't reach the hotel so they organize a cycle rickshaw to pick-up/drop-off guests from the other side of the bridge where there is a parking area.

haridwar,"Ganga Lahari Leisure hotel in Haridwar is just a home away from home. Highly personalized facilities with the warmth of their staff members made us writing this review.  The accommodation, food and warmth of their staff members are remarkable. We have stayed in at least ten best properties in all over India from North, South and East in 2019-2020 trip, but the experience in Ganga Lahari significantly differ from all of them. In the comfort of a star accommodation in Haridwar, Ganga Lahari is bound to create a very different impression in your mind that perhaps you won't get in most of the five or six-star properties in India. It is a mystic environment that connects you with the past and future, just like the river Ganga. It gives you a feeling of continued Indian tradition",Prof Bagchi JP,/Profile/bagchiss,,50
haridwar,"The best thing about the hotel is its location. It is located on the Ganga river and everything is very close by - walking distance. I was accompanied by my mom who could not walk much and hence the place was perfect. The place does not look very nice from outside and because of the location, one has to go through a crowed road, but once we were inside we found the place modern and clean. Rooms are big. We sat in the  balcony and watched the Ganga go by and the life along with it. The food is good though we think the service at breakfast could have been better. A point of improvement could be to add new towels in the bathroom. The towels in my bathroom were very old. The staff at reception were very warm and friendly specially Lucky. The special escorted Ganga aarti is a bonus",parinita b,/Profile/Parinita2015,"Nairobi, Kenya",40

A unique way of transfers by Cycle Rikshaw (customized and personalized by the hotel)   I wud say it's a hidden gem in the heart of Haridwar city, you will not able to judge from outside this hotel it got an old heritage rustic look but once u enter in the hotel it's really feeling- nice fragrance in the small lobby, courteous staff (especially Ms Raveena - guest relationship) she was outstanding.   Food quality was really nice - one should try their Thali ( Thank u chefs for making our anniversary and stay special)  Housekeeping and room - The size of the room were really nice and the housekeeping team done their best to keep making us comfortable.

Location - 5 Star  Right on the bank of the river, what a great view from the corridor. Brilliant. And walking distance from the Har ki Paudi and old market. Unbeatable.   2. Rooms - 4 Star Very clean opening to a corridor. Missed windows in the room, but they are spacious and the AC doubles as a heater. The corridor with the chairs overlooking the Ganga makes up for the lack of windows.   3. Food - 4 Star  Superb. Unlike my brother who chose to eat at local eateries, we had the buffet at dinner and at breakfast. Extremely good taste. Local delicacies were really well made at both meals.

The approach to the hotel is through a crowded bridge over the river. Cars are not allowed there. So, you need to get down from your vehicle near a parking lot on the other side and the hotel sends hand driven auto rikshaws to fetch you and your luggage. Its a very short distance and one can walk it down too.  Upon arrival, the check in was very smooth. The lady in charge - Raveena - was very efficient and gave us a quick overview of the facilities at the hotel and the timings of the aarti etc.  The rooms are quite spacious.

It is a small, neat clean hotel with good rooms and good bathrooms too. The food is a delight. Good choice for bfast, great choice for dinner. The bhajans during dinner time were splendid. Turn left and you get many food options outside. Turn right and you are in the bazaar. The ghat is a 5 min walk. The only thing was that the pandit, who though very nice, puts you in an awkard situation at the arti, to donate something to him. That put me off. I was happier feeding poor people outside.

haridwar,Grt location and very helpful staff. If u want to stay on har ki paudi then its the best hotel to do so.   Only disappointment is that the ganga view is not from the suites or rooms. One has to step out of room and come to the aisle and then u have ganga view. One might get an idea from booking sites as if the ganga view is from inside the rooms while it is in reality from outside the room if u sit in the aisle where chairs r provided.

The room was very comfortable - we did mention to one of the chief managers of the hotel that the air conditioner and ceiling fan is making too much noise and he was very emphatetic about it and suggested that we change room but we were about to check out so it had no reason to do so. The room is comfy, shower is great. One of the 4 days there was no hot water - we didn't exactly understand the reason why and it didn't come back until the next day. We found it odd in such a hotel.

The trip was two-fold: as I also connected with a friend who had come to meet me and for Ganga darshan; we had two adjacent rooms and a relaxing time at the hotel. The staff was friendly and special mention to Lucky and Ekta. The welcome was very warm. The food was excellent and the staff accommodated my dietary needs - am grateful for that!

We started getting phone calls and emails from Swati, Guest Relation lady of the hotel a few days before our arrival to confirm our arrival details and also advising us on the best route to take to reach the property. On arrival at the hotel everything worked almost like clockwork, welcome, check-in in adjoining rooms, lunch arrangements, tour of the place etc. etc. Having stayed in most of the best hotels in the country, I was very pleasantly surprised to see that this hotel can embarrass most of the 5 star hotels in the country in the way it handles guests.

Sit in the verandah and keep observing the waves of ganges and be mesmerized by its beauty. The famous bramahkund aarti is hardly 100mts away and the moment you get down from the hotel you can sit at the banks of ganges and enjoy the waves.. immerse flower boats or take a holy dip.

The food is good and they have a lavish vegetarian spread. The only problem is that the meals are are buffet at fixed price which seems steep if you are not in the mood for a wholesome meal.

haridwar,"A fine choice for a Haridwar stay. The location is great - right on the Ganges and all staff have been exceptionally helpful. The restaurant is good but the best feature of the hotel is the hallway with a great view of Gau Ghat - one can people watch for hours, from the comfort of the hotel.",TravelMasala,/Profile/TravelMasala,"Seattle, Washington",40

Well laid out breakfast with good attendants..One should keep in mind that this hotel is on the Gau ghat..so no car can reach till the hotel, they have a rickshaw to ferry across the bridge..overall a good place for family / solo stay.",Shibaji_Majumder,/Profile/Shibaji_Majumder,"Kolkata, India",50

Visiting from U K where we settled 26 years ago, our children were mesmerised by the experience. Very courteous staff, excellent food, the Manager was excllent. The staff helped us in navigating our way through the crowds too. Great photo opportunities too.",mol161,/Profile/mol161,"London, England, United Kingdom",50

I am thrilled to say this place is a total find! The prices are very reasonable, the staff is friendly & helpful and the rooms are spacious & very clean.  With the rushing of the Ganges just outside the windows (on the river side) and the frenetic atmosphere of this town, returning to my suite was a pleasure and a place of calm.

haridwar,"I happened to visit Haridwar recently. Someone suggest Ganga Lehari Hotel to us. In fact I was booked there. With a lot of doubts in mind we reached the parking lot next to the Har Ki Pauri next to the Police Control Room. You can not drive to the hotel. Instead, the hotel sends you a rickshaw for luggage and transportation. Parking and the hotel are separated by the mighty Ganga and a 100 metre bridge over it.  We chose to have a leisurely walk to the hotel and were rewarded by the most beautiful views of the ghaats and the Ganga.   The hotel is right on the Subhash Ghat. Once you enter the lift, though small, you are transported to a different world altogether - tastefully done up rooms, clean and well stocked bathroom, a verandah with chairs from where you can watch the Ganga",Somesh G,/Profile/S0meshG,"New Delhi, India",50

I must admit, initially I was worried if I have made a right choice considering that I was travelling with my one year old daughter.  Trust me once I reached there, I felt that this was much more than expected.   Room are done beautifully in a contemporary way to exceed all expectations.  Excellent service by a team member - Deepak. Genuine and ever smiling.  Breakfast spread was good and best thing - it was not repetitive both days.  Location wise, I don't think there will be a better hotel in Haridwar of this standard near har ki pauri. Beautiful view from the corridor.

Located just meters away from Har Ki Pauri the hotel is a quiet haven in the middle of the hustle and bustle of haridwar. I wrote an email to the manager but did not get a reply for 3 days. I followed up with a phone call and after that the hotel swung into action. Not only did I get a detailed response but they accommodated my request for a delayed check out for one of the rooms so that my elderly parents could rest. No where else in the world have I had the experience of delaying check out by several hours at no extra cost.

haridwar,"The best thing about the hotel is location. It is right on the bank at Gau Ghat. Rooms are spacious and toilets very clean an well provided 9an acid test for quality of hotels in india). Their site make you believe that there is a private balcony over looking Ganga but actually it is a comon corridor. In absence of privacy you may desist from enjoying the view from here. There is a restaurant at the hotel which is quite good. The south indian dishes (idli, Vada) may be far too hard for their authentic versions but rest of the stuff is quite good. Staff is polite and very helpful. They help you with a priest to help you offer or witness Ganga aarti at Hari ke Pauri every evening, This place is about 100-150 meters from the hotel. the river bank infront of the hotel is not very",sanjay sharma,/Profile/sanjaysanjay10,"New Delhi, India",40

Very nice furniture, and very comfortable bed; breakfast foods were delicious, dinner also very good, and the staff was very pleasant mostly; why not 5 stars? a bit noisy with other guests staying at the same place, the cheap looking toiletry (we are so reliant on hotel toiletry now because of the airline restriction so this will make or break the rating for us), highly recommending this place for this location :)",liket0g0,/Profile/liket0g0,san francisco,40
haridwar,We stayed one night here on 21st April 2012. The hotel is at excellent location. It is right on the Gau ghat which is 100 m away from Har-ki-pauri ghat. Parking is exactly at the other side of the river. There is a over bridge for pedestrians and rickshaws which is crossing the river and it brings you from the parking place to the hotel. Exactly Back side of the hotel there is the gali for shopping. The Gali also takes you to the Vishnu Ghat. Bengalis may note that Dada-Boudi hotel is close to Vishnu ghat which may be around 200 m walking through the Gali from the hotel. Ganga view from the terrace is fantastic. The hotel is neat and clean. Quality of food and service are very good. Don‚Äôt expect any garden for this hotel. Highly recommended.,PrasunMondal,/Profile/PrasunMondal,"Mumbai, India",40

The hotel is sold as a heritage property but beleive me it is truly a boutique hotel the real heritage property is its sister property haveli hari ganga which is about 4 mins walk in an even busier street of haridwar both properties are absolute gems in the mayhem called haridwar.

Our room, which was on the second floor, was beautifully furnished with a super bathroom. Outside the rooms there was a corridor with seats, tables, pretty carpets and huge picture windows looking out onto the River Ganges. I sat here for almost an hour watching the pilgrims from all over India walking past - fascinating!  My husband was not well, so I took the buffet dinner, and he had a plate of plain rice and a plain naan at no extra cost. We were very  impressed by this thoughtful treatment.

We booked 'Haveli Hari Ganga' through our online booking system at work. It all appeared to go through successfully. A day before we were to leave, I had someone call the hotel to arrange a pickup. And lo behold the hotel had no clue of our booking. But, to their credit they managed to find rooms for almost ten of us - between two of their properties - Haveli Hari Ganga and Ganga Lahari. I firmly believe that mistakes do happen, and what separates great hotels from others is how they handle it.

The staff were excellent and uniformly helpful and went out of their way to help with getting to the hotel ( no cars , need to arrange a rickshaw) ; the rooms are very good with good hot water , good beds, sat TV , writing desk, tea making facilities etc. More to the point the hotel is in an excellent location right on the river and within minutes of all important ceremonial ghats etc. One step outside and you are in either alley life or riverside life with plenty of good cheap restaurants and good food. As Haridwar is a holy city there is no booze ( 5 km exclusion zone ) but we alcoholics managed to survive this . Possible only negative comment is there",BirdsEye,/Profile/IguanaSydney,Sydney,40
