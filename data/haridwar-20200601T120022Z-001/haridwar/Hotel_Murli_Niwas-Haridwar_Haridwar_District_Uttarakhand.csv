haridwar,"I checked into Hotel Nurli Niwas cos they had a room available in the busy month of June, when the hordes descend upon Haridwar for the char dham yatra. Well!the hotel is okay for one night. Their housekeeping, cleanliness and customer service leave much to be desired. Just okay for a night if other places are full!",Anjali P,/Profile/798anjalip,,30
haridwar,Should hangover once when you visit at Haridwar it’s very innovative with economical price . Just love to stay there for a week more if you want to watch ganga and many more temple you can watch from there and it’s near by railway station.,@raghav,/Profile/raghavsoni1134,,50
haridwar,"As we staied in Haridwar only for one night the location was very important to us. Hotel Murli Niwas is located very near the train station in a peaceful street. The Bara Bazzar is just a few minutes walk away. We have chosen a room with fan as we don't like AC, especially not in the hot season when the temparature difference is to big . The room was small but cosy, with good bed and OK bathroom, allthough I somehow missed hot water. The check.in process could be faster . Don't show up before noon as the start cleaning the rooms when all the guests have left. The manager is a very nice man, very friendly and helpful and made us feel realy welcome! All in all: if you are looking for a comfortable no-fuss room, I recommend to choose Murli Niwas.",bernarda69,/Profile/bernarda69,"Maribor, Slovenia",40
