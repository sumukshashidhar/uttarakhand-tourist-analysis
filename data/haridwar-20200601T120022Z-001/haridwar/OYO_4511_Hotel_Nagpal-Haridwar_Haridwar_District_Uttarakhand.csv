haridwar,The hotel is at a very prime location and the access from bus stand and the railway station is very easy.  The pictures shown on the website were very good based on which I booked my stay. The actual was a ditto copy of the pics and that boosted my confidence on the web booking,trilochansaini,/Profile/trilochansaini,"Riyadh Province, Saudi Arabia",50
haridwar,"The first thing I want to say is that if you have been to India before, you should expect the broken sidewalk construction rubble, low hanging powerlines typical of some areas. Despite outside appearances, the area itself is a good area of Haridwar, and a little less chaotic than staying near the train station.  On the inside, the hotel is fine, quieter than one would expect. The room is quite nice, clean enough, the bathroom has a hot water shower. And in early winter mid November the hotel room is warm and comfortable. The staff are non invasive.  The wifi is only the symbol, there is no actual internet connection.  I paid less than 20AUD per night. At that price I canâ€™t fault the hotel. ",aidaiablaze,/Profile/aidaiablaze,"Katherine, Australia",30
haridwar,"21st Mar'18 I had visited a Hotel Nagpal, it was my very good experience with the hotel. I was reached at early morning at 4 AM, staff as arrange require things. I very satisfy with hotel staff and location also, its just closed to the main highway.",bpsingh92,/Profile/bpsingh92,"Faridabad, India",50
haridwar,We apeared there in early morning 4 am. It was very kind of staff to accept us in such time. The room which we have choosen in one click just to sleep after night bus journey was good enough so we decided to stay there one more night. In my experience OYO provids neat and clean rooms in small hotels such as this one in low price. That was a good luck for us. I would reccomend this hotel for travelers who are visiting Haridwar with the purpose to explore it.,Perwana,/Profile/Perwana,"Moscow, Russia",40
haridwar,This hotel is on the main road and the hospitality is quite ok.  The place is very near to the bathing ghats (nearly half an hour drive).  But those who are really old will find it difficult to climb the stairs.,Sowmya M,/Profile/sowmyam2014,"Chennai, India",30
