haridwar,"Receptionist is hardly present. The rooms are dusty, and bathroom are even too small. Moreover, sanitation systems are also not working. Overall, my experience was the worst there.Kindly avoid this hotel whenever you visit to haridwar.",Ramvir Solanki,/Profile/ramvirsolanki7875,,10
haridwar,"I like to stay here because of behavior of owner Mr Gagan madan.It is centrally located near shiv murti in front of railway station.Rooms are good but bed sheet and kambals are needed to be changed.In 700-800 per night you can get a.c.room here but before check in confirm the rate.Infront of this guest house you can get best  raghuvansi gujrati bhojnalay,and very close agrawal bhojnalay.If you do not expect high then only, choose this hotel.",athelbc,/Profile/athelbc,"Lucknow District, India",30
