haridwar,"Had stayed with family for 1 day and room we're very clean. All basic necessities like Car parking, food at genuine rate, Holy environment as temple inside Bhawan and proper maintenance of room as well as washroom.",Ashisham6,/Profile/Ashisham6,"Mohali, India",50
haridwar,"This is hotel more like a dharamshala. There are many rooms and can accomodate very large groups of 300 people. The rooms have attached bathroom and have mostly a sharing of 2- 4 people. The amenities are very basic, bed, plastic chairs and a closet with mirror. This is very good for large groups as they provide a separate space for cooking for large groups by their own caterers. It is located off the main road and the approach road is in poor condition but the main road is merely 20 feet away so access for transport is easy.  The rooms are in very poor condition and the bathrooms are unclean. The bathrooms are not equipped properly so there is no water supply in the wash basin or no hot water available, depending on the room allocated. The cleanliness of the rooms and bathrooms",Nilma S,/Profile/nilmas2017,"Mumbai, India",20
