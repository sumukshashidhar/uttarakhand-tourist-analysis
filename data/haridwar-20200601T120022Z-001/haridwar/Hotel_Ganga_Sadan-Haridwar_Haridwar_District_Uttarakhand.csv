haridwar,"Stayed for 2 nights with family. It’s an excellent place to get the feel of Ganga. The hotel has a small ghat to take a dip in Ganga as well. Food was homely and reasonably good. Improvements can be the housekeeping services like better quality linen, towels and regular up-keep of the coffee bags. Tariffs are high compared to the room size. Still I would recommend it primarily because of the amazing view the rooms have.",Randeep,/Profile/Randeepbora,"New Delhi, India",40

haridwar,"If you are visiting Haridwar and not staying near any Ghat, it does not make any sense. Ganga Sadan is nice place to stay with family, as it is adjacent to Ramgaht it gives very nice feeling. Though approach to the hotel is from bit narrow lane but dont get dejected by that, hotel is good, clean and good staff. Food quality is also very good safe for even child. roof top restaurant and the view thereof is awesome. But keep in mind you are in Haridwar hence, even three star hotels are bit like two star only. The key thing is proximity to ghat and market. Enjoy Haridwar.",Hiten Sheth,/Profile/hmsheth,,40

The hotel sent their staff Arjun who guided us through an alternate route to reach hotel. I was impressed with their customer service.

haridwar,I visited on 17th April.we were two families  with 4 kids. The hotel provides amazing view of the Ganga. Also it has private that and also changing room available.  But this is the only thing I find good about it. Firstly it is overpriced. Very small rooms ...we were in need of extra bed...which we took only in night as there is no space in room to even roam after that extra bed. Staff is very slow in responding.  The worst part is it's food menu. Very less options available for dinner. However breakfast has variety. But the staff is so slow in refilling..that u might get irritate. In two days stay we were struggling for even bread n butter.as my daughter eats this only. Overall ok ok experience. ,Shubhra03,/Profile/Shubhra03,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30

Staff carried our luggage the short distance to the hotel. Being off the street turned out to be a bonus, because we had no traffic noise. Our riverfront room was excellent with the Ganga rushing by our window. It had the feel of being on a houseboat :) The hotel has its own private bathing platform, which was important to us. The bed was really comfortable with spotless linen. The amenities could have been better, we couldn't access Wi-fi without going down to the lobby & our TV didn't work.",Amanda R,/Profile/AmandaR759,"Byron Bay, Australia",40
haridwar,The hotel is located in an obscure location; one has to enter small lanes to get to the hotel which pretty much doesn't give a good first impression. But it is very good hotel with decent food and view. Although I personally find the menu is extremely over priced as per the standard offered.  Tandoori items are usually not available but yellow Dal tarka is too good and I will recommend a must eat item. Rooms are also comparatively over priced they needs to rationalize the rates both area F&B and Rooms. I liked there terrace restaurant (open air) it is too romantic at evening. Mostly staffs are courteous and helpful all though a bit professional touch is recommended but not much of it. If you want to enjoy river Ganaga then it is certainly one of the good place to stay.

haridwar,"We zeroed in on Ganga Sadan post going through a number of hotel reviews on Tripadvisor as we wanted a hotel on the banks of the Ganga. We were really apprehensive as this was not a known property. We reached Haridwar from Mussourie and took a long time to find the hotel.  The hotel is situated in between 2-3 shabby buildings and there is no car parking or access road. The hotel GM sent a bellboy to carry our luggage and even after reading the reviews we were rethinking our decision to check in. However, the minute we entered the hotel all our anxieties were put to rest. We were welcomed with a traditional thali and tikka. Our room was quite spacious with a beautiful view of the river Ganga. The welcome drinks were sent to us immediately along with a fruit basket. The room had",ReshDC,/Profile/ReshDC,Mumbai,40
haridwar,"A very good hotel with decent food and view. when we started toward hotel after reaching haridwar, crossed a very narrow street and  thought was , did mistake boss. But when inside hotel, it was good. We had dinner and breakfast there and both were good. Specially they have good terrace with ganga view, which  was awesome.

haridwar,"The hotel is located in a obscure location, one has to enter small lanes to get to the hotel which pretty much doesn't give a good first impression. However, once you go inside the hotel, it's not too bad. It's situated right at the banks of Ganges so you have a good view of the majestic river from your room. The room was clean, with a flat screen and pretty comfortable beds. They provided portable heaters since we went during winter. We had some issue with hot water and they brought down a pail of hot water for us to bathe! I guess the  hot water in the hotel had a delayed reaction cos it was only working after some time. We endured a long drive and just wanted to take a good shower n rest. The food was good, the staff were polite and courteous.

haridwar,"We stayed for possibly the shortest time there, but the room, food and hospitality were excellent. The hotel was probably an old haveli on the banks of the Ganga. Difficult to imagine how one would have made it the way we see it today. Staff was extremely courteous and helpful. we had decided to check-out early in the morning, they helped us with some sandwiches as the breakfast was not ready by then. The tariff is slightly on the higher side and so is the food ( a single roti costed INR 45/-), but i really did not mind paying for it.",RBM0307,/Profile/RBM0307,"Bombay,India",40
haridwar,"I'd recommend this hotel very highly.  It's a little pricey, but if you don't have a problem with that, you'll be very satisfied.  You couldn't ask for better Ganga views, both from the rooms and from the balcony restaurant, which serves excellent food.  Probably most notable is the exceptionally helpful and gracious staff.  We really felt welcome and well taken care of here.  I'd stay there again for sure.  TIP: Nobody around the area seems to know where this place is (for example, the taxi and rickshaw drivers), so make sure you take a business card with you with the address on it whenever you leave the hotel, or it could take you a long time to find your way back.",Dennis L,/Profile/DennisL574,"Vashon, Washington",40
haridwar,"We stayed at this hotel in September 2011. Hotel arranged pickup from train station so finding the location was not a problem. The hotel is located in a narrow lane and after entering the hotel everything else was very good. Rooms are quite beautiful, modern. Welcome drink was offered upon arrival. The rooms provided to us was Ganga Facing. Hotel has a private bathing area so you can have have a dip in Holy ganges just after checkin at the hotel. Terrace restaurant was good. Evening was quite relaxing watching Ganges from the roof top restaurant.  Ganga Sadan is a good place to stay in Haridwar. The only drawback is the narrow lane while entering the Hotel, But after that everything was very good.",Vikas R,/Profile/Vickyrai,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
haridwar,"It was an onorous task to first locate the place and it is a scary to even imagine that I actually drove in the narrow lanes of Haridwar and that too a sedan. Car parking was a downer - the parking is a public parking place about 200m away from the hotel. We commuted from the parking to hotel by cycle rickshaw, though the rickshaw's were easily available and pretty cheap (Rs20/- one way). Once we reached the gully in which the hotel is situated, I got a shock of my life. The buildings in the lane (not the hotel building !!) looked dilapidated. I was cursing myself to have chosen this hotel through the net. However, once I took a turn in the gully to the hotel, I was greeted by a brightly lit hotel reception which looked as modern as any good hotel should be.

haridwar,I was going to Haridwar with my in-laws /Husband and my 4 yr old son. This was our first trip together so was concern about the staying and food etc as I wanted to make them feel special without getting into hussle -bussel of Haridwar.  I saw many reviewes about Haridwar hotels on Trip Advisor (which was VERY helpful). I narrowed down to 2 hotels which was offering the same deal. But one hotel had almost 60 reviews (good and bad both) and Ganga Sadan had only 1 review. I decided to go with Ganga Sadan and I am glad I took this decision. Private Bathing ghat was greatt- without worrying about our belongings we all could enjoy for hours. Both Ganga facing rooms were absolutely great view. Roof Top was amazing and gives beautiful view of Ganges.Staff was very nice and helpful.  We,Shelly V,/Profile/Shelly_vrm,"New Delhi, India",40
