Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Had a late night check-in at the hotel, as it is the nearest to the railway station and we wanted to avoid going to the city in extreme winter conditions. The surroundings are scarcely habituated with large open spaces. The hotel room was not spacious but was comfortable enough for an overnight stay for a business traveller. The service was very prompt and the food was good. The attached bathroom had 24-hour hot-water facility, which had to be verified due to lack of evidence found. Even though we took two blankets each & the room was visibly sealed, the chill made its presence felt all through the night.  Overall, a less than a ideal comfortable stay, but good enough for a short one.",AdityaK,/Profile/AdityaK,"New Delhi, India",30

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Good comfortable hotel to stay with It is the perceptive and friendly service that makes it worthwhile staying in this small family-run hotel. The owners and staff are social at just the right level and they go to great length to make you feel at home. In the afternoon, the staff would bring out snacks and coffee for guests who had opted to spend the day in the shade of the palm trees in the little garden. At no charge.",sanjev,/Profile/sanjev,"Dehradun, India",40
