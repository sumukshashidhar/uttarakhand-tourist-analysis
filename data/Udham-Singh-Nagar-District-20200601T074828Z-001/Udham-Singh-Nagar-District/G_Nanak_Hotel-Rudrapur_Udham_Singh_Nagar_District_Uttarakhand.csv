Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Had been going to rudrapur  for over 10 years but this place has lost its old charm. The service continues to be ok, a change in manager as well as management notwithstanding. Overall  a good place for staying due to its central location and low price.",Alok S,/Profile/aloks961,"Mumbai, India",40

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,I used to frequent this place about 5 years back. At that time the management was different.Had recently been to this place. It has changed a lot. A new large restaurant with great variety has come up in place of a limited variety restaurant.  Overall a decent place to stay.,Alok S,/Profile/aloks961,"Mumbai, India",40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,The hotel is slightly away from the main road but in the heart of the city. Location is good. room service is also good. The restaurant offers a large and tasty food variety. Staff at the hotel are very warm. Overall a good place to stay.,Alok S,/Profile/aloks961,"Mumbai, India",50
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,I have frequently visited this hotel and always admired the cosiness and warmth the place /staff offer. Management has changed hands but the quality remains reasonable. Rooms and service are good. Food is served in room as well as their restaurant but is equally good at both. Value for money place i say. ,Alok S,/Profile/aloks961,"Mumbai, India",40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,I have been staying at this hotel for the last 7 years and initially it was a very good hotel with great personalised service . Then with a change in management the quality of service dipped drastically. Of late the service has inched up slightly and i would rate the hotel as average.,Alok S,/Profile/aloks961,"Mumbai, India",30
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,I have stayed at this hotel for 3-4 days on a few ocassions and the stay was ok. The plus point is that the hotel has a restaurant on the ground floor which serves good food.  Another plus point is that it is situated bang in the middle pf the city and the pricing is OK considering that.  Overall it is an OK place.,Alok S,/Profile/aloks961,"Mumbai, India",30
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,This is a B&B that is suited for business travelers on short stays in Rudrapur. Only 2 rooms on each floor have windows. The mattresses and blankets are not as clean as one would like it to be. The bathrooms are quite clean. The options on the food front are quite limited. Minor consolation is that it is within walking distance of the market. Would never suggest taking the family there.,AbhishekAntony,/Profile/AbhishekAntony,"Chennai, India",20
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"This hotel is now called Hotel Gravity. Let me start with the room. It was horrible, we changed the room, immediately after finding no sliding glasses for the bathroom. Also, there were some odd stains on its walls. The worst part no HOT water. Specially, after travelling the entire day. The bed was big and ok. The staff (total staff 3) were kind enough to allow us to move to the next room. The next room we were put up in was without any windows but okay, given what little option we had. Keep in mind room numbers ending with 1 and 6 have a window with the view of the street. That is the best room with a view. Now the service seriously was not even up to the mark. With 3 staff working round the clock its a crazy festival. 1. You order beverages up. There is a mix up with what was",Cianthonydelima,/Profile/Cianthonydelima,,20
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"I have stayed at G Nanak a few times and this place has its fair share of surprises and mostly disappointments. We by nature tend to let it go and deal with it. The hotel is very average, rooms are ok (could use a good mopping up), fairly clean bathrooms and sub-par service. There is always some issue to deal with whether it is the linen, plumbing, Air conditioning or TV. The restaurant is ok and serves good food options. The staff are friendly and try to go out of their way to help but mostly incompetence is the barrier. Sometimes they have noisy parties on the rooftop without any consideration to the people who stay in the hotel. Most rooms don't have windows so they are perfect for sleeping in, you will never realize the time of day unless you look at a clock. The major plus",Shankar V,/Profile/453shankarv,"Chennai, India",30
