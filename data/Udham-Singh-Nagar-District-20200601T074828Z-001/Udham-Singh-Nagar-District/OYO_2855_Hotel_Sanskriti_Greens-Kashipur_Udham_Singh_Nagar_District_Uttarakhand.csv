Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Excusite place for stay in Kashipur. I was taking my parents to pilgrimage. Had a one night stay in Sanskriti Greens. Marvellous rooms, exceptionaly well maintained property and very well behaved staff. Even the room service boy was very well mannered. Loved the stay, although stayed there for only one night. Good parking for cars, well sanitized washrooms, clean white Lenins and very tasty food. I give it 10-on-10 rating.",girishanjhim,/Profile/girishanjhim,"Ujjain District, India",50
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Well, it was a quite a night. I booked the hotel via oyorooms at 4am and got the confirmation within 10 minutes that room is available and I can check in. Although it was quite a task to find the hotel as it's not easy. Finally, I reached the hotel and room boy showed me my room. This was more of a marriage spot with rooms available but I didn't regret it. The Room was huge and bathroom was fine. Free wifi was available and breakfast was good too. Overall very good experience in a very small city. Got more than what I was expecting.",Piyush K,/Profile/sirfpiyush,"Hyderabad, India",40
