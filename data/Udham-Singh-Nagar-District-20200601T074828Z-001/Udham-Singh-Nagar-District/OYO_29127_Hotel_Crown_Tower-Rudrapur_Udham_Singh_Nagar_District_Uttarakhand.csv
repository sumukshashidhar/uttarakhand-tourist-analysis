Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,This one is close to the SIDCUL indutrial area which is the nerve centre of business activity in rudrapur. The hotel itself is neat and clean and offers value for money. For short business stays at a very economical price this place is recommended.,Sureka S,/Profile/SurekaS11,,40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"If convenient and central location is your priority then Hotel crown tower is the place to be. The hotel is conveniently located in the town square and has reasonably OK amenities as far as room service , food and room cleanliness is concerned. Very economical pricing is also its plus point. Overall a decent place for short stays.",Sureka S,/Profile/SurekaS11,,40
