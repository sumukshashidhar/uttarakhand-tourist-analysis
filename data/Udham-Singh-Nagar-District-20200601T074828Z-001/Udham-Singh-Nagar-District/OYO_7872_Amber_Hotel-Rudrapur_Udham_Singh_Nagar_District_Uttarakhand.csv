Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,Came here for a night stay with family over the weekend. Hotel rooms were good and clean. Shall be my first preference if I'm on a budget. Also the hotel is centrally located and markets are nearby. Could not try their food options as we had short of time,Sahil,/Profile/Sahil2701,"Noida, India",40

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Stopped for break journey on our way to Nainital. Had a strong recommendation from a close friend already and Amber did not disappoint.  Courteous staff, modern & plush luxurious rooms which looked so fresh as if renovated yesterday.  The restaurant was cosy and food out of the world.   A must recommend for a break journey night stay if you are going from Delhi to Nainital. Start at 1600 hours, break journey at Rudrapur and leave all rejuvenated after a sumptuous breakfast the next morning to reach Nainital. Cheers",ALM,/Profile/thesaint2019,"New Delhi, India",50
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,Excellent stay on our way to Nainital. This hotel is more than 20 years old. Don’t go on the looks at the outside. Once you go inside it is all newly renovated. Great food. Comfortable stay. Hospitable staff. They also have a Tanishq jewellery showroom on the ground floor and is at the prime location of Rudrapur. ,Beenu Malik,/Profile/beenumalik,,50
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"I had visited Rudrapur last month for some official purpose and stayed at hotel amber and I must say that my stay was extremely comfortable. The hotel is centrally loacated and has an amazing restaurant which services a variety of cuisine. Their butter chicken is simply delicious, the perfect blend of sweet and spice. The staff is extremely helpful and courteous. The rooms are well built and bathrooms are very neat and clean. I believe it’s totally a value for money experience and I shall definitely make my booking for this place every time I visit Rudrapur.",Deepanshee,/Profile/DeepansheeBhugra,"Noida, India",50

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,This was probably tge first hotel i stayed at when i first went to rudrapur a good decade back. Th hotel continues to be as good even today. Bang on the main road the rooms face the road and therefore the hustle and bustle of the city ensures you do not have a single dull moment when you stay here. Room and food quality are good.,Sureka S,/Profile/SurekaS11,,40

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Hotel Amber is situated in the middle of the busy Rudrapur Market and in that sense there is never a dull moment in case you stay in the room for long. I say this because i had gone on company work and ocassionally if i came back early i could afford the luxury of going to the busy market in no time.Being right in the middle of the market helps because you get a variety of choices for eating out-be it lunch,dinner or timepass snacking.Overall a good hotel for its location.",Alok S,/Profile/aloks961,"Mumbai, India",30
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"I happened to stay at hotel amber on a business visit to rudrapur. The hotel is at a very good location, has easy access to market etc., parking space is available and was highly recommended to me by the locals and office colleagues and I was not disappointed. I was welcomed by the staff and guided to my room which was booked for me by a colleague. The rooms were very spacious and washrooms were quite hygenic. Since it was lunchtime and I was starving, I immediately decided to order for lunch. The food was very very good. I would highly recommend the butter chicken and paneer lababdaar to anyone visiting the hotel. At dinner time, I also ordered the chicken Kali Mirch and was mighty pleased with my decision. The food was truly the highlight for me. I don't know if it was the",mayanknayyar,/Profile/mayanknayyar,"New Delhi, India",40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Hotel Amber is located in a prime location of Rudrapur. Hotel is not so lavish/modern but it offers good rooms at decent price. Manager and higher management is good and very helpful, but serving staff is not so qualified for hospitality. Staff were recruited among local workers with less knowledge of good hospitality, but they serve there purpose. Food quality was average, only few Indian dishes were good , better to have dinner outside. safety and security is there,no need to worry.  They offer discounts as well on Room Tariffs as well.  Over all experience is OK",Ashutosh M,/Profile/567ashutoshm,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
