Udham-Singh-Nagar-District," A comfortable three star hotel in Kashipur, enroute to Corbett National Park ( 30 mn away) or while visiting IIM Kashipur. Reasonably good value for money. Has most facilities you may need. Large sized room, king sized bed, TV with satellite cable , good sized bathroom with comfortable water pressure in shower,etc. It has frer Wifi in room but did not allow for more than one device, which is unusual. There is a nice garden area, which is pleasant for evening gatherings or cocktails/dinner even in late March. ",arvind1000,/Profile/arvind1000,"Pune, India",40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"We chose this hotel as we have stayed here before. We were here for a night in the month of October, on a pleasant night. We asked for extra bed as we were 3 adults, the extra bed was just a bedroll; to be laid on the floor. That wasn't something I was impressed with. The room on the ground level/ ground floor could always have the possibility of  insects creeping into the bed on the ground. Fortunately , nothing of such things happened. The room was small but clean and had a functional bathroom attached. The room that we had in our last stay in 2017 was definitely bigger and better.  The food in the restaurant was good, we chose vegetarian options.  We were planning to checkout and drive further to Nainital at 6.30am, the hotel offered us packed breakfast.

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Manor Hotel , Kashipur. Date: 1/12/10 The room was booked by the client as this is the best hotel available in the town.  The food quality is quite good, however the cleanliness of the rooms needs improvement. Although it says 24 hours service, however when I reach there at 03.00 am, the gate of the hotel was closed and the gate keeper & receptionist were sleeping. Breakfast is ok as no continental food served.",saching21,/Profile/saching21,"New Delhi, India",30
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"We booked this hotel during our Nainital - Corbett trip - a colleague had a local acquaintance who suggested this place to be good for a family stay. The ambiance of the hotel is very nice with good service and hospitality. We reached the hotel at 9:30 pm and although we left at around 2 pm the next day after a good night's rest, we had a very good feeling about this hotel. The stay was very comfortable and the food was also great. When leaving, they arranged a taxi for us - we had a check on the fares by comparing with other operators and found it to be competitive. We were extended all the help we needed to make our trip comfortable.",S0URAV_R0Y,/Profile/S0URAV_R0Y,"Mumbai, India",40

It gets very cold in January. the rooms are provided with heaters.  The rooms are very good.  The buffet spread in the restaurant is also very good.,smsomani,/Profile/smsomani,"Pune, India",30
