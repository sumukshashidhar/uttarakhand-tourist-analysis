Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,The manager has no way to talk. He behave like a fool . The services are very bad . I suggest to take your contract from this hotel because the business is very bad and its effect your business also . I suggest all the booking sites to do the same,Aniket M,/Profile/AniketM153,,10
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"This is a good property to stay for short stays. Located in the heart of the city it offers decent amenities like clean room, convenient location and very helpful and courteous staff. The market, bus stand and  commercial area are all located close by.",Sureka S,/Profile/SurekaS11,,40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,This hotel is as good as my second home because I stay /go there frequently. The staff of the hotel have become very friendly due to my frequent visits and therefore do not hesitate to go out of the way to offer me services which are not part of their regular offering. A very good hotel.,Alok S,/Profile/aloks961,"Mumbai, India",40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Had been to this hotel a week back and chose a different room than the one i usually stay in. The room, to my surprise was quite spacious and had a very lovely view. Food though has become a concen since the hotel does not have a full fledged kitchen and can serve only limited meals for breakfast, Lunch as well as dinner. Otherwise an ideally  located good and reasonable hotel.",Alok S,/Profile/aloks961,"Mumbai, India",40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"I had recently visited this hotel last month and found it have undergone some changes. While there is nothing more to add to my view about its excellent central location, neat and clean rooms , etc. the one-two changes i noticed are   a) It has stopped its kitchen or rather its converted its hitherto kitchen into a very limited variety kitchen. You will get a Thali or very limited offerings during breakfast , Lunch or Dinner. But this may not still hurt since there are plenty of eateries nearby.  b) The second change is that they have ties up with Oyo.  I still continue to recommend aroma as a decent hotel for regular / repeat stays.",Alok S,/Profile/aloks961,"Mumbai, India",40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"The Hotel is Located bang in the middle of the busy market and walking distance from the Bus Stand.The rooms are neat and clean and the service is decent. For short trips of 3-4 days as i go for, the food variety does not hurt -else the variety is slightly limited.The view from the road facing rooms is great as they open on the main road. Staying at this hotel has never given me a dull moment.The pricing is also decent.",Alok S,/Profile/aloks961,"Mumbai, India",50
