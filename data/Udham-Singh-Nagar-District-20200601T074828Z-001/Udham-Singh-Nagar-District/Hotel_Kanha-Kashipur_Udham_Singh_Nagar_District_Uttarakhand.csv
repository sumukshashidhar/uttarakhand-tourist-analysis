Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"It was a good experience with Hotel Kanha. We stayed at this hotel for a short period during our visit to Moteshwar Mahadev Jyotirlinga, Kashipur. Rooms a bit small but sufficient for two people with cleanliness. Bathroom also equipped with basic facilities like geyser etc. Hotel staff was also good and humble. Location was excellent it just opposite the Kashipur Junction Railway Station.",Viral Arya,/Profile/ViralArya,"Trimbak, India",30
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,Very bad experience with this hotel I will specially suggest not to visit I was staying for 4 hours and they charge me 1400 but in online when you check it's only 750 or 980 for 1day  And then they don't have any backup for electricity I and than thiet AC they switch off after 5 am very bad experience after that if you are staying in any hotel they include breakfast in the tariff but I paid that breakfast bill too  Staff useless Rooms are ok but too hot  Very bad experience  Never gonna visit again,Akash G,/Profile/AkashG695,,10
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"For our two days stay at Kashipur we for family booked this hotel, it was nice hotel but some amenities were we could not find. its not luxury hotel but staff were very co operative as well as they were helpful at us every time. Hotel room had enough facilities we had found it were all in working condition and ready to use. nice sleeping quality made us so happy and they arranged extra services for old age people too. hotel has good enough space in the front of hotel to park vehicle and for entertainment for kids. Overall enjoyed the stay.",Dhruv_Touristor,/Profile/Dhruv_Touristor,,50
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,Hotel Kanha is situated just opposite to Kashipur Railway station. It offers average quality rooms and food. This is recommended for low budget stay or very short stay for tourists or business groups. Food quality is Ok. Staff is cordial.,Vadlapatla,/Profile/Vadlapatla,"Pune, India",30
