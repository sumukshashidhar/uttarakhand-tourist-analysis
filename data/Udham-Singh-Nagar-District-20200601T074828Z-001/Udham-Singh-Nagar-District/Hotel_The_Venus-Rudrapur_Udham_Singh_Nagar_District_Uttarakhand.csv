Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"The hotel is situated on the right hand side when u are driving from Delhi, its a new property and an impressive one, ample parking space for cars. The rooms are good, the furnishing is neat and tidy, A.Cs are chilling. Breakfast buffet is not very impressive but their restaurant menu is awesome we had ordered both veg and nonveg dishes and also with some changes to it and they were mde to perfection as per our demand... At time of power cuts it takes some time for the backup",ToothForTaste,/Profile/ToothForTaste,"Ghaziabad, India",40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"The hotel has come up recently and has very impressive facade. There are very few hotels of this size in Rudrapur i must admit. The rooms are clean and good and the food variety is very large. The clean,large and well maintained restaurant is a plus point of this hotel. The only small negative is that it is slightly away from the city.",Sureka S,/Profile/SurekaS11,,40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,This hotel provides worst food just save cost. Do not go to this hotel just to save company cost.  It will damage ur health because these people provide stale food. Rooms are spacious and average but food is bad. ,prashant s,/Profile/673prashants,"Wakad, India",10
