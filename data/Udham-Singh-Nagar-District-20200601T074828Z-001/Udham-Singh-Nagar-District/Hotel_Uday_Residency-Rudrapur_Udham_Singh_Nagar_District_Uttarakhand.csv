Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,I visited the restaurant yesterday (22/08/2016) with my 14-15 friends to celebrate a small get to-gather. But I really felt ashamed of before my friends for choosing this restaurant. I had requested the hotel Management to improve on following at the minimum-  1. Dirty table cloth and napkins. 2. High delay in service of food. 3. Illiterate waiters. 4. Very poor AC cooling for which we had to request to put a pedestrian fan. So that we can eat without sweating.  The environment is not at all conducive. I am not sure about rooms since I didn't saw them but occupancy seems to be very low.,maujiKanpur,/Profile/maujiKanpur,kanpur,10

The hotel is situated just opposite to Radha Swami Satsang Ghar, a Community Service Center and offers a beautiful look. The restaurant was big and I must admit that the food was equally good.

In such cases, attendants generally assure guests that some one from maintenance team would fix issue, and these things take time....however, not in case of this hotel.  Attendant took onus and changed fridge immediately to ensure that I dont face any issue.  Such instances rarely happen. Privacy is also another USP of this hotel.

Had dinner at the hotel everyday as there was no other restaurant nearby but the food was pretty good. The hotel is quite spacious just like the rooms are. There is a small swimmiming pool which is situated in the centre of the hotel and can be viewed from the hotel corridors, reception and restaurant which makes it a bit awkward.

Rooms are nice, with hospitality stepped up since it has been acquired by 1589 CLARKS group.  I do want to mention that the branding does not seem sufficient, within the hotel; and more importantly in web pages (tripadvisor, google maps etc), as it leaves a huge impact for searchers.
