Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"It was amazing to stay at Hotel Sonia. It is a nice big property with sprawling lawns, banquet hall, spa, swimming pool etc. I stayed with my family in presidential suite. The room was clean and big with all modern day amenities. The restaurant serves great food and fulfilled our taste buds. No doubts it is one of the bests in Rudrapur. Anyone travelling by Rudrapur must stay at this resort.  The owner Mr Anand himself makes sure that his guests are comfortable and have a great stay at this property.",Anuj Bansal,/Profile/anujbansal05,,50
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Hotel Sonia is the best hotel/resort one can find in Rudrapur area. I was travelling beck form Nainital and booked this resort for overnight stay. I had a pretty experience. Its a very big and very well maintained property. We were attended by the owner himself,  Mr. Anand Rungta. He is a pretty nice gentleman.  Even the food/dinner was quite good and the restaurant was full with local resident. My kids enjoyed the pool in morning which was of decent size and water was clean. I spend my time in gym and taking spa and massage which was also a good experience.",VivekKanda,/Profile/VivekKanda,"New Delhi, India",50
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Hi,  The stay at Hotel Sonia was different from other hotels as I normally stay in Business hotels. It has lush green garden, serene and peaceful ambience with a good maintained swimming pool. Restaurant and food is good, will like to give special thanks to Sachin Kumar (server) in restaurant for extra care and courtesy. Only negative point is nearby temple with loudspeaker in early morning. Overall very economic as rooms are big. Don’t expect too much luxury as it is budget hotel.",Gaurav_Garg82,/Profile/Gaurav_Garg82,Gurgaon,40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,We had dinner at Hotel Sonia. Some of the friends opted for drinks so had to go on the first floor. The facility at first floor doubles up with bar and restaurant. Whereas the ground floor facility serves only as restaurant.  The service was average perhaps the staff needs some grooming. Food was also average with limited options to choose.  The outside view of the hotel is more appealing than any thing else.,Natureinabundance,/Profile/Natureinabundance,"Bengaluru, India",40

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,Excellent ambience and location .There is lots of greenery and open space and gets one close to nature. The quality of food is great especially in the restaurant.  Staff if pretty helpful and sincere. Excellent place to take a break for night stay or transiting to and fro from Nainital especially if one is driving down . Well equipped fitness centre and swimming pool are added attraction. Good open parking available and one need not enter town or congested market to reach the place as it's just on the highway. The Banquet Hall is sufficiently away from the guest rooms and  does not cause any disturbance to in house guests. Great place .,rohit c,/Profile/rohitc1065,"New Delhi, India",50

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Though I have visited this hotel umpteen times on my way to the hills, I wonder why it never occurred to me to add a review to this hotel. In the thick of the crowded Rudrapur city, situated bang on the highway this property has it's own sprawling space with lawns and mango groves. It is an ideal stopover for people travelling to Almora,  Kausani, Munsyari etc etc. especially when they have started late. It has large comfortable rooms with all amenities, a restaurant, a bar, room service. Food is very good. Rudrapur is almost midway if you intend to go deeper in the hills.",dilipgupta,/Profile/dilipgupta,"New Delhi, India",40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,Probably the only person writing review while in the hotel. I stayed in 103 room - there is no hot water. Yesterday it was supplied in bucket. Then water supply went off. Today again no hot water ! Wi-fi in the room is not reliable at all.  Breakfast was average and despite asking for no chillies in omelette it was loaded. The poori was cold too.  Last night had to ask for extra mosquito replellant as there are too many of them.  Not worth staying for 3000 INR per night.  Avoid staying if possible.,Vaibhav D,/Profile/VaibhavD221,,10
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"My first visit to Rudrapur this summer. We chose to stay at this hotel from the other two 5 star properties in the city, even though its not a 4-star hotel in the true sense. However the hotel is very well-managed.  I was very pleasantly surprised, perhaps partly because I wasn't expecting much. The whole place is very airy and open. with a nice big lawn in the centre of the property.  There is medium size swimming pool which I used.   The spa is great as well, mainly due to the excellently trained personal who knew a lot about the way muscles and never should be pressed.  The winning point of the hotel is the Food, its absolutely top notch Indian food for Lunch and dinner which you could expect at any of the best restaurants in India.  However they should change the linen and",avinash s,/Profile/avinashs440,"Nyon, Switzerland",40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,A good old hotel in the foothills of Himalayas. No high rise buildings no artificial glamour...just a old time charm with shades of mango orchard. However once you enter the room..it is one of the finest & oldest hotel in Rudrapur & good/must place for a days halt while going to Nainital.,Prabhat Khare,/Profile/prabhatkhare,"Kanpur, India",40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,Good location right off the main Delhi highway that's the only positive.  Rooms and sheets were dirty they charged for a bowl of fruit in the room which we never asked for food in the restaurant is of very poor quality. also there was a wedding reception being held at the hotel so it was loud and people everywhere so we couldn't sleep. Never again - front desk staff is rude.  Stay at the Radisson blu instead...,barramundi_13,/Profile/barramundi_13,Michigan,10

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,I have visited this hotel on couple of occasions for business meetings. The Hotel is conveniently located and has good facilities. The rooms in the newer wing are comfortable and spacious.   During our meeting - staff promptly arranged 20 chairs in the room for seating arrangements. You can yourself assess the size of the room by this.    Staff is friendly and helpful. We had to entertain some scientists in the room and the staff was very prompt in providing and service and made several rounds to provide excellent service.   The restaurant Menu has fairly good choices and the food quality is also very good. Morning breakfast inclusive with all bookings is fairly good and a value for money option.   I would recommend this hotel for its good value and service to all business,Harsh_Dhanuka,/Profile/Harsh_Dhanuka,"New Delhi (Delhi), India",40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Hotel Sonia is a three star hotel situated at Delhi Road, Rudrapur. One unique thing about this hotel is that it is amidst huge green trees of mangoes. You see greenery all around, most of the rooms when you open up window you face a garden.Swimming pool is fine and food quality is excellent. Hotel has a free pick up service from the Railway station. Bar service is remarkable.",Vikas_1966,/Profile/Vikas_1966,"Pantnagar, India",40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Everything about the hotel is ordinary, the rooms, service and the restaurants. It feels run down and old now.  However the location is good and it is quiet, being away from the city. The hotel has a bar and restaurant & free wi fi.  With many options like Raddison Blu & Ginger available nearby, this hotel should be avoided.",ismad,/Profile/ismad,"Noida, India",30
