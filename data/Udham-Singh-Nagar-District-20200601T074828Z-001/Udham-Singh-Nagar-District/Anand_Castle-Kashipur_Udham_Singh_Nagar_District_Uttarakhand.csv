Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"We stayed as a overnight while travelling upcountry . From the outside the hotel looks nice , even the reception is decent .   However the rooms are dirty with dust all over , there is a smell in the rooms , cockroaches, and the bed sheets were not clean ! And to top it all the walls have some kind of drip marks ( like soft drink or something ) .  Really sad and poor cleanliness.  ",Uday T,/Profile/udaythareja,"New Delhi, India",10

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"First up, if I could give this hotel a zero rating I would. Was supposed to be 4 star but way off the mark. First thing was that they stuffed the booking, all of the rooms smelt like mould and were all dirty including the sheets. Aircon and TV didnâ€™t work in any room. We had to ask for towels and toilet paper. The towels they gave us were damp and smelly. Two of the rooms had no hot water.",Troy H,/Profile/troyh262,,10

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"We'd decided to halt at Kashipur on our way to Pangot and despite being in a rather crowded and dirty place, the hotel was nothing like it. It was a very quiet hotel, with wonderful rooms, resembling those of a 5-star one.  The stay at this hotel was a lovely experience, all thanks to the friendly and diligent staff. They had the most comfortable beds ever, and this was frankly the best sleep I've ever had (trust me, I sleep a lot).  The food was gobsmackingly delicious, they had a wide assortment of foods to choose from. They even offered us arrival drinks! The washrooms were hygienic beyond belief and you couldn't spot a speck of dust. Even the water tasted good, somehow.

Those being winter months, it was bitterly cold in the evenings. The hotel took special care of my kid's comfort and placed blowers to warm up the room before we returned. I was very happy with the gesture. The room size is good  and they were generous to upgrade me to a even larger room. Thank you.",Bhargavpd,/Profile/Bhargavpd,"Jaipur, India",50

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,It was a great time to stay in Anand Castle. The service is really good.

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Writing this review in the mid of our business trip and we are currently staying in this hotel.   This has been so far the most pathetic hotel with terrible services ever. The quality of mattresses, bed linen, housekeeping services, cleanliness is completely below any minimal standards. The bed cover and pillow cover were torn, no complimentary water was provided in the rooms and when we asked the reception, we had to wait for half an hour to get the tap water. The bathroom was also very small with poor bath fittings and without shower curtains. We had to spill 2 buckets water before we could get warm/ hot water.The hotel is totally in the poor state with no cleaning done. The housekeeping staff does not empty the dustbins on daily basis. The rooms in this hotel are extremely",mohitsachetee,/Profile/mohitsachetee,Jaipur,20

Slightly odd that you can't drink alcohol in the restaurant but have to go to the 4th floor bar, where there are a couple of private rooms as well as a open bar. No cocktails were available despite the long list though- beer and vodka only for some reason. Still, we had a good time. ",Anita G,/Profile/724anitag,"London, United Kingdom",40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,I stayed for 1 Night at this Hotel. We had booked the Superior room. Overall experience was quite good. The room size was comparable to a suite. Food was tasty. Would recommend you to try their newly opened Bar and Chinese food. Hotel location is on the way to Nainital and Corbett National Park. This makes it a good pit stop to recharge your batteries for the long trip to or fro.  I would recommend this hotel for Families and business travelers. ,Shantanu L,/Profile/shantanulavania,"New Delhi, India",50

I requested for changing the room instantly but was denied saying no other room is available in that category. Finally i stayed in the same room for a day .
