Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"I recently stayed here while on a group outing.  The property is seemingly tucked away from the main road so it does not appear inviting from the road yet that feeling changes once you enter.  The lobby is spacious and welcoming.  The staff is helpful and accommodating.  The rooms were comfortable with the amenities we needed.  We did use the dining services on multiple occasions, and the restaurant staff also were eager to help us enjoy our meals.  I especially liked the breakfast buffet where the chai tea was excellent and the options suited everyone.  I would recommend the freshly prepared omelettes.  Overall this place suited our needs.",Fleishum,/Profile/Fleishum,"Gaithersburg, Maryland",50

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"First and foremost the team is quiet accomadating, I have been staying here from the last 2- 3 months consistently and not much to complain.. Breakfast is not very huge spread but a decent one.. tasty.  Bar is also quiet okay with necessary drinks and nibbles  The point of improvement is on the noise levels in certain rooms where you have the A/c Generator or the chiller plant noise coming into the rooms(I had to change my room on account of that)... the rooms were immediately changed on request.  A very good thing is that they do also provide accommodation and food for the drivers who come with the guest a very nice positive gesture",shashi b,/Profile/897shashib,"Chennai, India",40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"The exterior of the hotel is grand, even the entrance, lobby, common areas look great. The rooms are also huge in size. But the downside is despite staying in a superior delux room, the bathroom provisions were very limited (no toothpaste or brush), the bathroom itself was stinking when I entered the room. I needed a queen size bed, which they didn't have (they said all such rooms were booked, but I had sent a request well in advance), there were mosquitoes in the room, no hand towel was there - I had to ask for it. Pillows were not up to the mark. Despite asking for a mosquito repellent refill (as the one in the room was already empty), they didn't bother to provide one. Very limited and below average breakfast spread. Thus the room tariff is steep compared to services. Food",femdel25,/Profile/femdel25,"New Delhi, India",30

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Stayed with my husband for two nights as we were planning to go Nainital for our Honeymoon but we got bit late and chosen the option to stay at Hotel Rudra Continental. A great property to be in for ones who love to spend some quality time with your loved ones as you feel Home away from home over there. Distinctly located in the city center so one can easily rome into the market, with easy approach, it's a perfect place to sooth your mind. In my personal opinion,hotel staff is too professional and too cooperative those take care with full dedication and dont let any stone unturned on your way this is what one looks for, when visiting for honeymoon.

The staff is very warm and friendly, the place is neat, service is quick, what I admired most is how the chef took special care of my meals. Then again, there is a flip side to everything, and this hotel is certainly no exception. While I conducted my training program, the staff in the background very very noisy, they laughed out loud, had their cell phones go off every once in a while, move utensils... and all of this just added to the noise.
