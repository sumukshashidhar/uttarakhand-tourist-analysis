Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,We stopped at Ananya for a night's stay prior to our visit to Jim Corbett and we weren't disappointed for our choice.  This is a big property primarily which seemed primarily for big gatherings or marriage functions. Our need was to have a comfortable bed & nice breakfast for which the hotel & the staff exceeded expectations.  There is a railway track very near & wakes you up every time train passes by.

Housekeeping is good. Restaurant has Indian and Contental style food. Good and safe. The breakfast is sober and limited and after 9 days not very exciting. Free WIFI in the room, but troublesome on some days also due to power outages. Next to that the hotel is noisy due to the fact that for the construction of the corridors and hall only stone and marble. Especially when there are aprties in side the hotel.

We were on our way to Jim Corbett, which is about half an hour drive from this place so can't review the accommodation facilities but can surely throw some light on the food that they serve. On our way we stopped at Ananya, to get refreshed and grab some breakfast. They have the buffet for Rs. 250 per person and it was worth every single penny.
