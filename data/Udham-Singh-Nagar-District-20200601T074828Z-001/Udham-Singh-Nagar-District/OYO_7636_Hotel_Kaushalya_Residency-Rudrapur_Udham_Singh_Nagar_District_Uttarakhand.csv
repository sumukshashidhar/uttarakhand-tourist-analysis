Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"This hotel is bang in the middle of the busy market place and has all attractions nearby. The hotel itself is good to stay with a restaurant on the ground floor which is just about average. The staff and management are very courteous,",Sureka S,/Profile/SurekaS11,,40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,This is in the bang of the city and there is absolutely no dull moment because of that. The restaurant on the ground floor is neat and nice and the variety it offers in veg and non veg is decent. There is bikanerwala bang opposite this hotel and the food there is great in case you dont want to eat at kaushalya.,Sureka S,/Profile/SurekaS11,,40

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Located bang in the middle of the market this hotel has average rooms and average food. The biggest advantage is its vantage location. You can step out of the hotel and have access to umpteen restaurants, the market ( in case you need anything). Unless you are looking for luxury this is a perfect restaurant.",Alok S,/Profile/aloks961,"Mumbai, India",30
