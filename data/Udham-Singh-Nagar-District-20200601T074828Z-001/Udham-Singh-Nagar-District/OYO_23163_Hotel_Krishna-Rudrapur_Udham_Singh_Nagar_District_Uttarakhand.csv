Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"This was one of my first hotels when i first visited rudrapur a decade ago. Rudrapur has since come a long way with many more hotels that have come up in this period. Hotel krish is on the main market road but except for the suite no rooms face the road which is a slight negative. Staff , service and food are all good. Overall there will never be a dull moment when one stays here.",Sureka S,/Profile/SurekaS11,,40
