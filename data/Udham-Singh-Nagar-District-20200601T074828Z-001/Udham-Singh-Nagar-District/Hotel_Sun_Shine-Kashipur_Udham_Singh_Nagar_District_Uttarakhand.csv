Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"The word says it all. Its a terrible hotel with no cleanliness or hygiene. I would say avoid avoid avoid. The rooms were pretty small and not at all well maintained. You can easily spot the wall being red(people have spit on the wall), and I feel it has not been cleaned for ages. Terrible washrooms, terrible beds. Checked in at night 9 30 and checked out the very next morning. Avoid this at any cost.",Shashank G,/Profile/241shashankg,,10
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"A very generic hotel. I found the prices to be fairly low (which is a positive aspect), and the hotel had decent service with staff that conducted business professionally. Location is convenient, and accessible. The rooms are spacious and were well made before checkin.",bsaurabh,/Profile/bsaurabh,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",30
