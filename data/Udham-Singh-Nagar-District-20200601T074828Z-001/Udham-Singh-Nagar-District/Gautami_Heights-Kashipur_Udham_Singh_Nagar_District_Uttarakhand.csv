Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"not a bad hotel but not so great either. 1. the rooms are decent but nothing great. 2. the rooms are not attended daily unless you specify/remind. 3. house-keeping is not upto the mark, since there are no standards/procedures in place. 4. the internet is deceptive, and you need to re-login after every few idle minutes, not to forget that the login expires/inactivates every 24hrs. 5. the restaurant is not bad but nothing great, the cuisine in the menu has to be reconfirmed for availability (sometimes even depends on availability of the cook). - there is no guarantee that any item will be the same on the next day, even rotis/nans.  the staff tries to handle the situations but with no system in place there is hardly any result.",Jitesh Talpade,/Profile/jeeteshtalpade,,30

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"I have stayed at this hotel many times but this was first time to stay with kids. as usual check in was through. room and bathroom were neat and clean. food was tasty and decently priced. everything was ok as usual. but when the kids wanted to use swimming pool in the evening, the coach there asked them to come after 7 pm. Reason being they had swimming classes from 4 to 7 pm. WTH? they are charging and allowing local people to come and use swimming pool for three peak hours and disallowing room guests to use the pool.   Spoke to their GM- Marketing and he said he will speak to the coach but all in vain. the coach again refused and said it disturbs his students. it was when i got a hot conversation with the front office manager and the coach and then he allowed the kids to use",Anurag,/Profile/anuban1977,"Muzaffarnagar, India",40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"We stayed there only for a night as we took halt there while enroute Dhanachuli. It is a new property so that's a plus point. But there bed linen was very dirty , literally stinking for extra beds. Even towels were also dirty but at least not stinking. If they improve their housekeeping then it's a good place. Breakfast was also okay.",kiran b,/Profile/kiranbirla74,"New Delhi, India",30

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,Pathetic hotel. Gloomy place. Reception as if staying in village. Would never like to stay again. Really a bad place. The reception was as if they did not care.  A better place to stay is the Manor Kashipur,Sanjeev K,/Profile/SanjeevK1282,,20

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Stayed in Gautami Heights for 2N/3D for a business trip. Hotel is nice with big rooms.Bathrooms are clean but need maintenance, tiles broken etc. Restaurant is good and food is awesome. We had Indian and Chinese and both cuisines were great. They need to rectify the wi-fi as its very poor with no connectivity even if you are standing under the access point. Hotel has a swimming pool. Hotel staff is helpful and courteous. Over all a nice stay. Food was a hit.",deepak k,/Profile/DeepaKaul,"Delhi, Delhi, India",40

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Located on Bajpur Road in Kashipur. With ample car parking and a huge lawn, swimming pool, gym and restaurant/bar. Check-in was through and the front office Manager was experienced and professional. Room was decent in size, neat and clean and came with complimentary breakfast and wifi. there was some issue in wifi which they resolved in minutes. Room service was quick and efficient and the food served was very tasty.   Morning breakfast was a buffet in the restaurant and was again upto the mark in terms of taste, quality and variety. check out was a bit slow and the FOM forgot that my room was prepaid and charged full tariff in my bill. Had to get it rectified and then paid.   Overall a very good hotel in a small city like Kashipur.",Anurag,/Profile/anuban1977,"Muzaffarnagar, India",40

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,There are less choices of Business Hotels in Kashipur. This is one of them. The Rooms are quite spacious and Bathroom are Clean. The Toiletries in Bathroom are not all good. The restaurant is a small one. The Rooms didnt have keys. everytime we had to call staff from reception to open our rooms. they it was an after effect of marriage party where lot of keys were lost.,smsomani,/Profile/smsomani,"Pune, India",30

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Everything about this Best Western looks good if you're looking for western style. Rooms are very nice and staff too. But once settled, not a single thing went right. The elevator was broken, the boiler was broken, it took 2 hours to deliver a bucket of hot water, the wifi wasn't working and neither was the cable. It could have been just bad luck, I hope so, I really wish I didn't have to say all this but this is actually what happened. Plus we were promised to get some packed parathas for our early morning departure and when we went to get them the staff was still sleeping in the restaurant and no one had heard about our order. It was so ridiculous that I wrote a letter detailing all this and told them I would pay less than half the price. To their credit there was no",mercy999,/Profile/mercy999,"Haridwar, India",30
