Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,I say this after having stayed in almost 6-8 hotels in the last 10 years in Rudrapur. It has recently come up and one of the reasons i like it is because of the large variety it's restaurant offers. The location and the room quality are great.,Sureka S,/Profile/SurekaS11,,50
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"The place would have received all the five stars if the two things that bothered me would have improved this third time that I was there.  1.The room service is really slow. 2.The arrangement for hot water during winters is questionable.  I tried having dinner in the restaurant this time and the service was not only faster there, but also, very personalized. I would still recommend this place because the staff is relly helpful and goes through great pains to make your stay comfortable. Do stay there.",Neelu222,/Profile/Neelu222,"New Delhi, India",40

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"This is a recently come up hotel about half a kilometre from the Rudrapur Railway station. There is a restaurant on the ground floor which has a large menu of items both veg and non veg. Such a large variety is  available with very few hotels / restaurants in Rudrapur.  The rooms are also very comfortable, brightly lit and well laid out.  The pricing is very reasonable.A much better hotel than Ginger.",Alok S,/Profile/aloks961,"Mumbai, India",40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,It's usually difficult to find a hotel which meets high standards in this area of India but Moti Mahal stands out as it was one of the best hotels we stayed at during our trip to India. We stayed at the King suite. It was a bit of a splurge for us but it was worth every penny. Food is really delocious and is recommended for anyone who enjoy North Indian cuisine. There is also a rooftop restaurant and bar if you have a idle evening want to grab some drinks.,shantanubhadoria,/Profile/shantanubhadoria,"Singapore, Singapore",50

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"I stayed here with my family for two days. The hotel's rooms were good, affordable and clean.  The best part about the hotel was the food. I believe their main USP is the food.   It was a good experience for us. We will definitely visit again.",Abhay K,/Profile/360abhayk,"Noida, India",40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,I stayed here in King Suite.Though the room was new and food was good But light problem in the night.There was no hot water.You cannot even use shower as there was no water pressure to use it.You cannot compare the hotel in 3 star or 4 star category.Budget hotel no need to spend much on this hotel.,GurinderPal,/Profile/GurinderPal,"Chandigarh, India",20
