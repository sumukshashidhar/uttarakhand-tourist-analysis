Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"The location of the hotel is good but unfortunately the service of the hotel is poor. Despite reaching out to front desk, in-room dining and house-keeping, they will service by taking their own sweet time.",amanvij09,/Profile/amanvij09,"New Delhi, India",20

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"The ambiance is beautiful, cozy, food is flavorful but sad to know that the staff is so unprofessional that they even don't bother to answer their customers with some courtesy. Further, the service of food is much much late that you have to spend at least 20-30 min waiting for your main course. The staff is not trained.",nikita,/Profile/nikki4718,,30
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"I stayed in this property for two nights along with my family. We had 4 rooms booked. This is a nice property however little did i know that the services will be far too poor and slow. We reached at 10:30 AM while the check in time is 2 PM. The only good thing , on request, was to arrange a room for all 12 members (kids & adults included) however the real fiasco started later on. For the other three rooms we checked in at 4 PM which is a delay of 2 hours, that too, with regular follow up.  In the meantime, when we went for lunch where the food was taking ages to come to the table and that too with a lot of follow up.  Next day we went out to do some sight seeing, nobody told us about the lunch timing. While we were on our way back, at around 3:30 PM I called up the hotel to",Gaurav B,/Profile/gauravb43,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",20
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"In one visit, you're told about poker/card room and how you're allowed to play there if you bring our own cards. But in other visit, you won't be allowed because some other manager doesn't even know what's poker/card room for. In his opinion, poker/card room is for kitty parties. And if you ask them to provide soft drinks and snacks near pool, they'll think you're asking for liquor. Although place is nice but service and management needs to be improved by a huge extent.",LoveTravel820670,/Profile/LoveTravel820670,,10

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Had a great weekend with friends staying at Bliss Hotel situated between Kashipur and Ramnagar approximately 45 mins drive to Jim Corbett National Park.   Four of us friends spent our first night in Room 310, which is the best room in the property in my opinion.  Room is very well made with luxurious interiors and state of the art facilities. The rates are also very reasonable. Since property is new staff is still being trained hence take some time for room service.  Food is very good and tasty and plenty of options are there. Breakfast served at Kesariya Restaurant has good taste and decent spread.  Best part about this property are the Gym, swimming pool and the Spa facilities which we used and found them to be best in class.
