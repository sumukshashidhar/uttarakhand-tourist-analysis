Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,I love the place for its food. The variety is awesome and the taste great. The location of the hotel is close to the sidcul industrial area and if you need to go to sidcul this is a reasonably priced good option. Stay is cosy and warm since the owners are punjabi. ,Alok S,/Profile/aloks961,"Mumbai, India",30
