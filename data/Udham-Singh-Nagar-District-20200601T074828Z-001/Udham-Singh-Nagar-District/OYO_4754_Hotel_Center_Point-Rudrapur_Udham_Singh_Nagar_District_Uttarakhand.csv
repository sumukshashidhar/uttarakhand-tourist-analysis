Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Pathetic hotel .staff behave like they are working in a dhaba. person at the reception who don't know how to speak to a guest.zero ethics. When I ask his name he replied to me that ''nam btana jaruri he'' . Then he told his name Govind. I was with my girlfriend and the staff of the hotel including Govind were straying at us. It was so weard. Staff was very unprofessional. Nice property but owner of the hotel should have work on the behaviour of the staff and should change the staff if possible . Not a single person in the hotel staff know how to smile, behave,how to talk.if the owner of the hotel don't change the staff oyo should have stop doing business with this property. I booked the room for two nights but I cancelled one night and book another hotel so u can think that I",ravi mehta,/Profile/216ravim,"Pithoragarh District, India",10
