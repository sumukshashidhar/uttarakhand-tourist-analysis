The whole hotel area is well maintained and they have a lovely pool area. Last but not least the rastaurant is very good. We had a dinner with customers and all what we ordered was super delicious. Small minus, because no local Kingfisher beer was available - which should be a standard item in such a hotel category.

This time I wasn't staying in the hotel but went to their Restaurant with family and friends for some snacks & beer. Well to begin the service standards have fallen here, as to what it was earlier. Although the food was good here as the kids also enjoyed their snacks.  The most disappointing thing here was the staff's cunningness to slip the bottle of beer, without providing proper information to the customers. As we were there between 5-7 pm and they have Happy Hour during that time, but no one informed us.  So we had 2 bottles of beer and when the bill came they charged us for 3 bottles. When asked they told us that we have given you the discount for the 3rd bottle and 3 bottles billing was due to",Yagvendra Chaturvedi,/Profile/yagvendrac,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",20

Radisson Blu, Rudrapur, is comparatively cheaper when compared to that in Delhi. You can go with the Carlson membership which probably would help you in getting discounts and free stay on point redemption. Membership is useful for frequent stays only. When it comes to room, size is pretty good for normal rooms and business class rooms are next level and the ambience is simple, elegant and a class apart. You would find the quality of food exceptionally good and there is a minibar in the room. You would find ceiling shower which I personally find amazing.

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"A good option for short stay considering the size of Rudrapur. It is situated on the main road though in a remote area. Its is an upcoming area where development has just started so you won't find anything of interest nearby at present.  Rooms are spacious, good, clean but washrooms need maintainence, which was clearly visible. An average pool is there. Food was ok but nothing great was there, a usual stuff. Staff was good but not very attentive. They cleared the luggage from the room of one family of  our group due to some confusion. Everything was safe, however surprisingly they did not try to call that fellow for the entire day when they were away despite having their numbers.",Raj-K-Arora,/Profile/Raj-K-Arora,"Ghaziabad, India",30

I have to say it turned out to be a great experience for our entire group of 15 people and we enjoyed their splendid service and comfort. I have had some mixed opinion about the Radisson brand but this place really was world class and would compete with some of the top hotels.   The incident that blew me away happened the next day after i checked out. I accidentaly forgot my laptop bag and some other valuables at the front reception while checking out and realized this only once i had reached Corbett.

Nice spread but could have been better. The lunch and Dinner was a disaster. Ate the same menu for all meals had here. May be bcoz I was part of a group booking at this hotel.

The other big problem is mosquitoes which were in the bedroom, corridors and main reception areas. Which makes you wonder if they have ever heard of pest control?

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"I am giving this 4 stars for effort. To put a hotel of this quality in a small town,and be able to provide the service and comfort of a Raddisson Blu is very creditable. Besides having stayed there a night in August 2011, we have now made it the mandatory pit stop for lunch or early dinner in our monthly drive up to Nainital. The food (avoid the buffet at dinner unless you are in a hurry) is pretty good, if you stick to Indian food. Lunch buffet, when on, is great value and quick. Rooms are well appointed.",Dsareen,/Profile/Dsareen,New Delhi,40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,If you are driving towards Nainital via Rudrapur this is the best place to break journey and stretch your legs. The hotel is situated just on the main road making it extremely convenient for road travelers to drop by. A small sign board conveys the message one is welcomed with open arms. That was exactly how we were welcomed by the reception staff.  Surprisingly enough the food was not as expensive as one might be led to believe and there was absolutely no compromise on the quality.The service was quick but not efficient and practiced.   There were too many waiters and every one was falling head over heels to please the diners. I would not say this is a disadvantage to the diners. May be an inconvenience to the waiters themselves.

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,It was a pleasant surprise to find a Radisson in a small town like rudrapur. The hotel was still not fully operational when we stayed there. But still it was quite good. They were holding a Punjabi food festival at the time. The staff was very helpful,Sanjana41,/Profile/Sanjana41,"Noida, India",40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"When you enter Rudrapur, it is surprising to hear of a Radisson in that town. But the real surprise awaits when you enter the hotel itself. The hotel, now almost completely constructed, comes as a wonderful surprise for a business travel to such a town. In fact so pleasant was my experience in the hotel, that I stationed myself there itself while visiting nearby towns like Haldwani and Kashipur  The hotel is present on the main road itself and looks like a typical Radisson. Though it is away from the main town, it is quite nearby to the airport. While entering the hotel, I expected to find down a stripped down version of the normal Radisson from the fact that it was in a small town and had very economical rates. All my apprehensions and assumptions were soon to be found wrong. ",AbhishekChandraGupta,/Profile/AbhishekChandraGupta,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",50
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,We were staying in this hotel during October first week of 2011 and curfew was imposed in the city. Hotel staff took lot of care of us and did not let us feel any difficulty despite shortage of food supplies etc. Entire team especially the Chef was very friendly and cared for our choices and tastes. Very nice bouffet for breakfast and dinner. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay for 5 days here.,jyotirmay,/Profile/jyotirmay,"Jaipur, India",50

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"I was stationed in Rudrapur for a project, a total period of 6 months and was eagerly awaiting for this hotel to open up. It finally did, with one month of my time remaining in the project. Though at the time of opening, not many services including bar, gymnasium, swimming pool were not availble, the rooms were well furnished.  Although rooms were not exactly spacious, and the corridors clustered, the overall look and feel is great. The best part is the lack of a open garden otherwise all other hotels host marriage parties in the gardens and its difficult to get a good night sleep starting November.   For a business trip, it gets a 100% recommendation. It is the best in Rudrapur.  While the menu items were limited initially, the food was pretty good, for a Radisson Chain Hotel.",Kartik V,/Profile/801kartikv,"New Delhi, India",40

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Having just opened their doors and with construction on the upper floors still in process, the employees at the Radisson went above and beyond the call of duty. The chef, especially, accommodated several of our group members with special requests and graciously came out personally to do so. The IT/wireless service needs some work as it went in and out of availability and guests choose the Radisson over other local hotels partly for this service. All in all our stay was excellent.",janmariec,/Profile/janmariec,"Indianapolis, Indiana",40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"I was staying at the Ginger hotel, when I decided to check out the restaurant at the Radisson Hotel. It is right across the road from Ginger Hotel and pretty close to the entrance for the Industrial Area. We found out that there are 124 rooms in the property, but only some are open for guests. One look at the rooms and we decided to check out of Ginger the next morning.  Currently they have a Coffee shop and a restaurant called Kumaon Cafe open. I had dinner at the Kumaon Cafe across 2N and the food was fabulous on both occasions. I actually had the courage to order Continental fare and it was on par with food you will get at Delhi or Mumbai.   The rooms are pretty spacious with great beds. The shower area is pretty large and everything is bright and shiny, which is expected a",Ketan M,/Profile/kemo0910,Gurgaon,50
