Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,The rooms are okay but I felt that the tariff was little bit high. The food is good and really enjoyed non veg. Electricity is a problem but they have DG for that. But you won't be able to enjoy the Air conditioning. It was okay stay,Mohan Raj,/Profile/MohanR1078,,30
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Slightly away from the crowded market area the hotel offers good ambience, clean room and good food. All amenities one would need on a short stay are at a stone's throw from this hotel.   This hotel is a good place to stay overall. ",Alok S,/Profile/aloks961,"Mumbai, India",50
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"To me the hotel location is very important. And this hotel is very centrally located in rudrapur.   It is close to the market, the bus stand and the industrial area of SIDCUL. Even malls and restaurants are very close by.   Stay at this hotel will never give you a dull moment.

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,If you have to work in Sidcul which the Industrial area where most factories are situated then this hotel is ideally located. The Bus stand and the market are very easily approachable.Food at the hotel is good but there are lot of options of eating out in nearby vicinity in case you want to try out.  Good hotel overall.,Alok S,/Profile/aloks961,"Mumbai, India",30
