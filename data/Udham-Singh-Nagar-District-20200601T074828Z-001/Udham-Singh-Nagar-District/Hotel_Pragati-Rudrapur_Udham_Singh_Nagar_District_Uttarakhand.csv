Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,For the price that they offer their rooms it is a very good hotel. The rooms are clean and neat and the staff is very courteous. The location is slightly off from the main city and this is a very small negative. Else  a good place for staying.,Sureka S,/Profile/SurekaS11,,40

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,The pricing is very cheap and therefore my expectations  of this place were not very high.   Surprisingly for the price they charge the rooms are neat and clean and food is also ok.   Overall a must stay for somebody who has a low budget. ,Alok S,/Profile/aloks961,"Mumbai, India",40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Well Hotel is situated close to the Rudrapur Bus Terminal and is a budget stay who comes to Rudrapur / Pantnagar for Company work . I stayed for a night , hotel was empty but room was big , ac was working and toilet was clean . Hotel food not very good so I would recommend you to eat at Bikener just few minutes away . The Sipcot industrial area is close by , staff was good . I would recommend this hotel for business stay for 1-2 days.",ROYKALYAN,/Profile/ROYKALYAN,"Mumbai, India",30
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,they have good infra but not well kept.  Water heater was not working properly(despite of telling 2 times) . i won't suggest for couples. although i liked the food very much and it was less expensive on pocket. Hotel is having access to market and location is good.,rks1985,/Profile/rks1985,"Jaunpur, India",30
