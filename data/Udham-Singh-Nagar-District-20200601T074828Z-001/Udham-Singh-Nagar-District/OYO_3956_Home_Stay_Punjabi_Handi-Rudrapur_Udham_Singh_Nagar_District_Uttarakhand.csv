Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"The SIDCUL industrial area is a stone's throw from this hotel and all daily amenities- market,busstand, mall etc . are very conveniently located. You will never feel bored at this hotel. The food is awesome especially in winters.   I recommend this as a good hotel for short business stays.",Sureka S,/Profile/SurekaS11,,40
