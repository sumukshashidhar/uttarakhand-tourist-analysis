Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"I often visit  this city.  This time I thought to stay in Rosewood,  I was surprised  to see the kitchen in my room. Now I was not interested to eat or order from outside , I had enough time in evening, so here i got apportunity to cook my tasty food.  I had never seen kitchen in any hotel room in India. This was amazing to cook yourself. This is a unique facility in this hotel. Neat and clean big rooms, helpful staff and Management.  A memorable visit.  Thank you",M Srikanth,/Profile/jlsrikantH,"Moradabad, India",50
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"I visited rudrapur last month with my family. We never felt that we are staying in any hotel, this place is actually a home. You don't have to struggle for milk of your infent. You can purchase from nearby shop, room is equipped with all basic utensils, we reheated not even the milk but also our food.  A decent breakfast is served at restaurant.  Management is very helpful. Overall a good service and a nice hotel with neat and clean rooms.",Msharma,/Profile/manijbpsharma,,50
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Rosewood is a hotel comprising of studio apartments and is located in a nice residential complex. The room was large, comfortable and had a furnished kitchen with microwave etc. The breakfast was decent and the service was good. Small gripe was that the washroom smelled slightly. Prices at the hotel are cheaper than online. ",Keshav A,/Profile/KeshavA73,"New Delhi, India",40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"My experience at the Rosewood Hotel in Pantnagar was astounding to say the least. The service and attention to detail was very personalised. I loved the environment and vibe which was pleasant and comforting. Checking in and out was a breeze. The property was brilliantly designed and furnished beautifully with all amenities on hand from the swimming pool to the gym and mini home theatre. The property was also in a prime location and conveniently located from SIDCUL area. The food was delicious and I was left feeling wholehearted and more than pleased (You have to try the dal and naan, it is simply outstanding!). The rooms were spacious and orderly. It was like that they were designed for your comfort and hospitablity. The staff were so friendly and welcoming. The room service",Smita V,/Profile/SmitaV54,,50
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,I visited with my family this time. I found this hotel the best in town because I am fond of eating self cooking food. Here I got this opportunity to cook. I think there is no hotel in town with this type of setup. Even they allow you to order your food from nearby restaurants.   Staff and managers are helpful to find out the nearby places. Good service with smile..  Wish to stay many more times in future. Thanks,Vinny,/Profile/Vinny01dli,,50

Breakfast menu as very limited.",himadrinayak,/Profile/himadrinayak,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,We stayed here on our Enroute journey from Pantnagar to New Delhi. As we were heading towards New Delhi and our flight was in the morning we decided to came back and stay here one day prior. It is really a nice place if you are a business traveller. It is a complete apartment in itself only the problem is of convenience. You cannot move around without A vehicle which is not easily available. That way it is very close to airport & with fully functional kitchen as well. Definitely a worth stay with a right price.,polvineet,/Profile/polvineet,"Nashik, India",40

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Having lived here biweekly for last 1.5yr has completely spoiled me, The quality and finesse the management maintains across levels is exceptional, service staff shows brilliant level of responsibility and courtesy when dealing with guests.

Staying here feels almost as home. Looking forward to their growth and presence in many more cities.",SAMEER G,/Profile/930sameerg,"Haridwar, India",50

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"Staying in Roosewood apartment hotel is the different unique experience. I always used to stay roosewood than Raddision and others. This is really different than staying the monotonous hotel rooms.  Ambiance is excellent. Food quality and taste is very good.  Room service is excellent and  Staff are very helpful and cheerful. Rooms are big and have all Home like facilities viz Sofa, Dining, Kitchen having Microwave, Induction, Crockery, Big fridge etc. all this at very low room tariffs.",maujiKanpur,/Profile/maujiKanpur,kanpur,50
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"I chose Rosewood as my original reservation in Ginger did not have accommodation for my chauffeur. The apartment charged extra for the same, but it was worth it. The rooms are very well furnished and maintained given the poor quality of construction of the flats. The furnishing allows entertaining guests in the room. The service is OK. The premises are very clean. There is ample parking space for the service apartment. The location is also near to the industrial area, in case business travelers to Rudrapur may be wondering. The food in the restaurant is good. But you have to drive out of the campus if you want to dine outside. The service apartment is suited for business travelers, who have got fed up with blande offerings of budget business hotels in the town.",FAHIEN,/Profile/FAHIEN,"New Delhi, India",40
Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,Room was good and spacious. Equipments were working properly. Good Ambience.   Swing facility of AC did not work. I think this does not work in most of the room.

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"This is a serviced apartment. Has a good restaurant which serves delicious vegetarian food only. No non-veg food is available. Has a free wifi but no swimming pool. Since Rudrapur does not have good public transport, connectivity to this place is poor. No access to market also which is almost 3-4 kms away. A small shop outside the Omaxe society provides tit-bits.Malls are coming up near to this place but till they start, no options to go out. If you have a vehicle, then you can go around. Ideally situated to travel to Industrial area nearby and Radission Hotel is a stone's throw away.",Ashwani_1in,/Profile/Ashwani_1in,"Ghaziabad, India",50

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"I have spent couple of nights in Rosewood appartments. My rating and evaluation is influenced by several issues that shall be mentioned here.  The food - restaurant (breakfast) is strictly vegetarian. Well, I can live with this. The problem is hygiene. Few examples: The staff touches food by hand despite of being asked from our side to use the tools - which is not acceptable. Opened packagings of butter had been mixed with not opened and served as okay. Restaurant and its cleaness does not match world´s standards. Staff of Rosewood shall visit hotels even in neighbourhood to see how clean room looks like.  The rooms - the biggest problem is cleaness and hygiene. To be fair - bed was okay. But. Issues can be find in restrooms - they really not clean. Warm water was not",Spotter S,/Profile/Sp0tterS,Prague,20

Udham-Singh-Nagar-District,"I have stayed here a few times on business trips to Pantnagar and have found this is a great place to stay for short term and long term stay. Priced very reasonable for the business and holiday traveler, the rooms are well appointed if you choose to use the kitchenette. Rooms have cable tv, comfortable beds, air conditioning and hot water geysers so it has all you need. The bigger rooms also have a balcony but not much of a view with all the construction around. The place is kept spic and span by the efficient staff. There is a room that doubles up as a gym - equipment is very sparse and could do with some upgradation but nonetheless it is there. Mobile phone signal is very weak and even datacard connections are a problem in this place sometimes but Wifi connection is available",Shankar V,/Profile/453shankarv,"Chennai, India",40
