tehri-gharwal,"We stayed at United 21 for a night over the long weekend with family - about 17 people. The views from the place are stunning - Himalayas in all directions, even though it is a bit difficult to get to- there is just a small path really which requires some treacherous driving skills to get to the resort. We didn't have advance booking, but even though the hotel was empty the manager denied us rooms because they had a big group coming the next day. After a lot of cajoling he relented but then obviously charged us much more than he otherwise would have. Anyway, so the rooms were very comfortable and they had plenty of extra bedding in all rooms for 4, even 5 people if required to share the rooms. Meals were just average, nothing great about them. They didn't have any amenities in",psachdev10,/Profile/priyankasachdev,"New Delhi, India",30

tehri-gharwal,"its a New place and is well build, has great views from each room, Rooms are spacious and well done.Food Services need to improve as they don't have much of the things mentioned in the menu available, so most of the time you will have to tell them in advance if you want to have a particular thing, but the chief and the staff are very cooperative and Good.  Its far from the main road , so either you have your own vehicle or call the resort to get one, as you wont find local convince.",Sudipto J,/Profile/sudip2j,"Lucknow, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"I had recently stayed at this resort, along with my family, that is about 2 km from the main road, on way from Chamba to New Tehri. It is small property with not much to do for kids. The rooms are newly furnished and look nice. However, the bathrooms are pretty basic and do not match up with the rooms. Though it is understaffed that affects service time, the staff is helpful.For its small size, it has a nice restaurant with a good chef. Tip: First floor rooms provide a good view of the New Tehri town.",Amit S,/Profile/amits771,,30
