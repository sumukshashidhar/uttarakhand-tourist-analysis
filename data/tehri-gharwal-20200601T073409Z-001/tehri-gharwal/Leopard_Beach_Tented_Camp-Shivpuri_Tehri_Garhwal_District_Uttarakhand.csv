tehri-gharwal,"while not much to choose over the other river rafting camps in terms of facilities (i have tried Aquaterra, Log out @work etc.), snow leopard is slightly pricier so that rules out random college groups joining in. Which is a blessing.   Also they seem to be very safety conscious so in the standard kaudilya to rishikesh stretch they didnt run a couple of rapids like Golf Course, etc. because the water level was high (though the other groups were doing them) - thats a good or bad thing according to whichever way you look at life.   they have a nice proper resort just up the road from the beach camp - all with swimming pool etc, but it seemed full of mosquitoes - anyways in case proper washrooms are required, those facilities are available at the resort.

tehri-gharwal,"This camp was just wonderful. The location was perfect, the accommodations were great, and the food lovely.  They took care of everything, we did not have to worry about a thing. It was total relaxation. When we went rafting they were fantastic as well, as they took us to the best spots, and made sure safety was first.  The guides were great and so was everything else. We were 20 of us and we all had an amazing time.",Avinash Thadani,/Profile/Thudput,"Mumbai, India",50
tehri-gharwal,This place is awesome for someone who is interested in spending time along the beaches of ganges and seeks adventures in the rapids. The hospitality of the staff is amazing. And better than that is the food which they prepare here. Evenings are pleasant when u can enjoy a  game of beach volleyball. This place will be more fun in a large group of friends,Anamika0Nitin,/Profile/Anamika0Nitin,"Kochi (Cochin), India",40
