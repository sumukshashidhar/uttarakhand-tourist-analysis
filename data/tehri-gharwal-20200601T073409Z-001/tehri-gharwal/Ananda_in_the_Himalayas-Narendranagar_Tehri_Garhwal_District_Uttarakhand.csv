tehri-gharwal,"For a perfect getaway, or to recharge your healthy habits, or to incorporate some well-being into your life, or to get energized, or for a pure, indulgent, pampering trip...get yourself to Ananda in the Himalayas and you might easily achieve it all.  Set against the backdrop of the smoky Shivalik range with the snow-capped Himalayas in the majestic distance, the hotel is strategically located behind the beautiful Maharaja's palace.  The spa boasts of a multitude of treatments performed by therapeutic and skilled therapists. The treatment rooms invoke a zen-like atmosphere further enhanced by the gentle and professional masseuses. The food is fresh, flavorful and healthy.

tehri-gharwal,We decided to go to Ananda for celebrating my Birthday in April this year. I was going to stay there for 14 days and my wife was with me for 7 days. I was on a Weight Management program and my wife was on Detox. Our first impression of the property was WOW. The entrance is Grand and extremely well maintained despite it being a Heritage place. The highlight though of our trip were two ... 1) The awesome treatments Ananada has to offer with some of the best trained staff in the business and 2) AMAZING HOSPITALITY... I have to specially mention Chandan Purohit who was in Restaurant and how helpful he was throughout our trip..It was indeed one of the best holidays we had since long and we would certainly go back next year.,Nisarg Trivedi,/Profile/NisargDubai,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",50

The massages were very good and so were the spa saunas, gym and pool. I did not believe in much of the verdict regarding my ayurvedic body type, but I still enjoyed my stay there. One huge minus was that the hotel tried to force us to eat according to our body types, which meant a very (very!!) limited menu of food choices. The menus were also contradictory to the ""doctor's"" verdict, so it all felt like bogus to me. We did not enjoy that part and it was not",jesshornell,/Profile/jesshornell,"Mumbai, India",40

Besides the guest rooms, one can opt for a suites or villas. The pool is open to the sky. The spa building houses a lovely souvenir shop.  A host of massage options are available at the spa.

Lastly, carry your own white clothing... its a nice experience for once to mingle in as opposed to stand out. YOu will understand the meaning when you reach there.

I eould really recommend this place if you want some peace and relaxing time with your wife/husband.  Conference facilities good and service of staff good. However...  In their restaurant the serving are really........... Slow......... If you are a group as we are you eill after a while feel a stress due to the very very slow servings. They served the pre-drink at the dame time as the pre-course and the wine. The light was so low lo so you couldnt actually see the food you are. Understand that is is part of their concept but would still prefer a more rapid servings and also some more lights around the dinnenr table.,UlfRud,/Profile/UlfRud,"Stockholm, Sweden",40

If you walk down to the town, just below Ananda you can coordinate with cheap transport.  What I recommend the most however, is take the bus with the locals - probably would avoid in hotter seasons though. Less than a dollar and a cultural experience.  I also received a great $2 haircut and a straight shave in town - used aftershave with alcohol for sanitary purposes.  Great experience.

tehri-gharwal,"stayed at the ananda over new year - what a truly amazing place! rooms were great, food fabulous (healthy, tasty and great variety) and the service could not have been better.   the spa was one of the best i've been too - and i've been to many!   the only complaint would be the spa reception - despite booking a package we had nothing booked when we arrived and trying to get appointments scheduled was a nightmare.   it all settled down after the first day or two and the frustration became a distant memory - the treatments themselves were incredible, every single treatment was done to a really high standard.   can't recommend the place enough.   stunning setting.

tehri-gharwal,"Agree with all the reviews, a little retreat far away from the hustle and bustle of aggravtating India!   FOOD: excellent, really surprised me.  I had been told no drinks but they do serve alcohol.  SPA: I just had one massage, because the prices weren't that cheap compared to other excellent treatments you can find elsewhere in India and in Asia (Thailand, etc).  But the massage was good.  The single-sex pre-spa treatment areas were also very nice, and free, with a large jacuzzi, steam/sauna and best of all, chill our sunroom but the in-house music system appeared to be off or not working, a shame.  ENVIRONS: Lovely. Nice grounds, and not many rooms, so you won't get overwhelmed by crowds.  A bit of an older crowd, no kids allowed. Plenty of activities, lots of them free.

Just WOW, the whole experience was incredible - service was exemplary, great food, fantastic treatments - the whole 3 days were spent in a state of euphoria.  Ananada certainly lives up to it's name.

tehri-gharwal,"We visited Ananda during the Diwali break. This was a very busy time for them and that resulted in an almost torturous process to get any spa appointment because their computerized reservation systems are so slow it would take anywhere between 15 to 30 minutes to make an appointment or to be told that there isn't any slot available. As a result, after two days we dropped the idea of getting spa treatments and decided to envelop ourselves with the stunning natural beauty and surroundings of Ananda. As a result there was no need for any treatment. Another plus is the heated pool. This is great when the temperature drops. A rafting trip organized by the hotel is must.

tehri-gharwal,"All the comments made by other reviewers were correct and absolutely reflect the reality. But all these travellers have been either very lucky or not travelling by plane to Ananda.  Our stay was great. The landscape and views around the hotel were magnificent, the room very confortable, the food in the restaurant excellent, the spa very good (although I have experienced better spa massage and facial in Asia - Thailand and Palau in particular)... everything was perfect except the last day...   So the review is only aimed at warning future guests to Ananda that they should check with the hotel and with the airline staff (better double check) if the flight is cancelled or delayed before they leave the hotel => Don't believe the hotel will do it for you although you pay and reserve",Sophie_In_Taipei,/Profile/Sophie_In_Taipei,"Taipei, Taiwan",40

If you  want to escape from indians and india but still love them, then you have to go to ananda spa on the hymalaias. You will get great treatments, perfect meditation and hata yoga classes. wonderful fatless food, in special environment. enjoy ananda.  take low cost flight form dehli and reach deradun. over there you will find a car and then ... the paradise.

tehri-gharwal,"I stayed at Ananda for just the one night following a trek in the Himalayas. All I can say is I loved this place. The rooms were stunning. The food excellent. And the scenery was spectacular. I had a room overlooking the golf course.   My only criticism was with the day spa. I had prebooked treatments before I arrived as I was only staying one night. Upon arrival I was told by reception that my treatments had been booked in for later that afternoon. However when I arrived at the day spa I was told that they were unable to perform my chosen treatments. They did however offer alternatives, which I chose to decline. Instead I hung out by the swimming pool, and with scenery as pretty as this who can blame me (see attached photo).   I did order an in-room milk and saffron rose petal",JAK035,/Profile/JAK035,Sydney,40
tehri-gharwal,"I recently returned from a 2 week Detox & Weight Management package at the Ananda - it was fabulous. The reviews it has had as an international Spa destination, are well deserved. Under the guidance of an Ayurvedic Doctor (as I did it using the ancient Ayurveda system), I lost weight, felt much more energised and went onto Goa, feeling so much better than when I arrived. I travelled out on my own, and felt very safe; it is worth the long journey to get here. The people who work here, really want their guests to feel looked after and nothing was too much trouble, including my list of foods I needed to avoid, to make the most of my changed eating habits (which I have maintained since coming home). I had such fun with the guys in the Gym, who again looked after me, and made sure I",azs07,/Profile/azs07,"High Wycombe, United Kingdom",50

This property is dedicated to rejuvenation with an all round focus on health and wellbeing.Perched on the side of the mountain with spectacular views over the River Ganges and valleys below.Although quite a trek to get there, once you do there is plenty to keep you occupied as long as you enjoy activities such as Yoga, meditation, spa treatments(The Ayurvedic ones are great)and I also highly reccommend the consultation with the resident Ayurvedic Physician who will diagnose your dosha(or Body) type and prescribe accordingly.An outstanding restaurant menu with plenty to choose from.

tehri-gharwal,"we stayed at he Ananda after a two week trip through northern India. After visiting New Delhi we arrived  there and though we were not in India anymore. The air, the clean surroundings, the views from the balcony and the bathroom, everything seemed perfect. The people are really great there, try to help. But we'd some problems: it was hard getting an appointment for a treatment in the spa, the steambath was nor working during our stay, in the restaurant the buffet with the starters was not satisfying and most of the wines on their list were not available. We had a pleasant stay, but we also think for that price, they should do some more. If staying there, do not forget to do that walk up to the temple they do every thursday - it is absolutely great.

tehri-gharwal,"I wanted to travel on my own for once. Im a journalist an had a pretty tough year. I wanted mental and physical relaxation, away from everyone and everything. I surfed through the internet and came accross ananda spa in the himalayas. Ive always wanted to travel there as i considered himalayas as one of the most mystical places on earth. So i decided to give it a go. I had no references but something was telling me it was exactly what i needed. Well, it was much, much more than that.  These place is heaven on earth. Up in the mountains surrounded by all sorts of green shades. The rooms spacious and comfortable, with large windows. the view is magical. The food is great even if you follow a weight control program. I think that their chef is a jackpot.  I booked the 8-day",339Angie,/Profile/339Angie,Athens,50

There was a driver from the hotel waiting for me and when I got to the car, it was running with the air conditionning on...and 3 little bottles of Himalayan spring water..The minute I saw those two little details, I just knew that I had made the right choice and that I would not be dissapointed in this choice of hotel.  When I arrived after a 40 mn drive up in the mountains, I was greeted with the most refreshing drink I have ever had and was then taken to the grand living room to fill out my guest card...none of that waiting at the counter stuff here!

The Ananda is heaven on earth.    A bit of a trek to get to (I flew from London to Delhi International Airport, then crossed the city to a smaller airport, from where I took a smaller plane (12 seater) to Jolly Airport, and from there a one hour drive into the mountain in a 4x4 - on the way back, similar but a 4 hour train drive to Delhi instead of the 40mins small plane flight), but once there it was worth it.
