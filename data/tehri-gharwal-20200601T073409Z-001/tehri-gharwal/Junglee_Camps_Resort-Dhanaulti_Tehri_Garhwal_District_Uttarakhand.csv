tehri-gharwal,"It was an amazing stay with the Junglee camp and resort. We booked some another property and just went for lunch there, however the property was so good that we all decided to stay in the camp only. Service and hospitality was so pleasing that have decided to visit here only whenever in Dhanolti. The behaviour of manager was also very nice and helpful. We had a wonderful stay. Thanks for the memorable service.",Pathfinder791522,/Profile/Pathfinder791522,,50
tehri-gharwal,We all came for a 4 day trip. We went to various places even before ranging from masuri tehri maclodganj and many more places.  But it might sound overrated but the reality does remains that we had the best experience with jungle resort. Junglee resort have good people who caters to all your need.  Everything at your command.  If your a camping person plus who needs clean environment junglee resort is a must destination for you.  With amazing quality food and best views.,Kush,/Profile/Iamkush,,50
