tehri-gharwal,"Set in the heart of the Indian Himalayas and surrounded by dense Pine, long wooded slopes of Deodar, Pine, Oak and Rhododendron forests, Jayshee Camps & Resort offers tranquillity seems to be straight out of some romantic classic. Wild Iris, snow capped peaks and heart filling peace embraces you here. The beautiful and picturesque 180 degree view of the snow clad Garhwal Himalayas will fill you with a romantic charm.  Beautiful and captivating environment and camp life will make you feel like the love and pleasure of lying in Nature's lap and what's more, it is the highest destination nearest to the city of Delhi - the Capital of India.  The place is almost perfect for an adventure holiday packed with Rock Climbing, Repelling, Valley Crossing, Trekking & Snow Walks or a quiet",SahilChrungu,/Profile/SahilChrungu,"New Delhi, India",40

tehri-gharwal,I went with my friends in the 1st week of June to jayshee kanatal camp post having spoken with the owner Mr girdhar who claimed the best of services and ambience. What they show in d photos and what it actually is..it's a sham. They hooked us one last tent left with them.  On having reached..the tent provided to us was ghastly..unkempt..all dirty muddy linens..it looked as if the tent had not been used in ages with all sorts of mosquitoes and spiders on d bed..walls. in the water bucket..dirty toiletries..nd on speaking with the boys there ..they claimed to have made the camp ready. On complaining since the camp was in a pathetic shape we were moved to a cottage which though again dirty was a shade better ..it took us almost 2 hours of trying to sort things out and settle down,Shal21,/Profile/Shal21,Delhi,10

tehri-gharwal,I traveled to this place through a group.....the pictures shown were very different from what the rooms were like.....the sheets were soiled and seemed they had not been washed for months.....i understand that it's a camp but it's important to maintain some standards.It was very cold the day we were there but got hot water after 1day of waiting only. Food is just tolerable.Some of the staff members are helpful.....but some are really weird. The only good thing .....about this place is the view and what a pity that even after having such a good location the owners are not doing anything to maintain their property.,V29A,/Profile/V29A,,10

We also had adventure sports. The best thing is the awesome experience in camp. Camp is very good condition with attached bathroom. So overall very good experience wid jayshee camp.

tehri-gharwal,"Hi,  Well this also known as Kanatal Camp. So, you will definitely get confused while you are searching for Kanatal Camp like I did.This is one of the Camp in Kanatal.  You can call on the no. and check if it is by Jayshee group or not.  Cons about the camp are as below:  -> This way deep in Kanatal area.So drive on till the end.This is the last camp as per me in the Kanatal route. ->This camp is not so lively and well maintained like other camp. -> So much was mentioned in Adventure Activity but they only let us do 2.  To be honest when I reached this camp I was pretty disappointed. As it was not green and it doesn't look anything like Kanatal Camp I saw in reviews. :( But the good part is the camp care taker made everything right for us.   The good part: -> Ask for hot water",sweta g,/Profile/luckyswe,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",40
