tehri-gharwal,"Horrific and terrible experience. I checked out in the middle of the night of the first day of booking itself. I don't even know where to begin. I checked in in the afternoon - the host Avirjaan was nowhere to be found. In fact, no one even knew anyone with that name there. Initially I didn't read much into it.  The room was decent but shabby with torn bedsheets and only a few working lights and the door was very difficult to lock. I was traveling solo and as a solo female traveler I did not feel comfortable there at all. In the afternoon everything was okay but as it got dark the vibe of the place just changed. There were unruly drunk men ( friends of the owner ) in the room right next to mine. The place was run by no official person just servant boys who kept pestering me with",Jay,/Profile/J0279,,10
tehri-gharwal,"For our stay in Rishikesh, we researched quite a bit and decided to give a try to hostel stay. After going through lot of reviews and extensive search we narrowed down on Indian Culture hostel. We felt that it is quite recent in hostel list of rishikesh. It is behind the laxman jhula taxi parking stand. Hostel premises are welcoming, rooms are neat, we stayed in a double room with attached washroom. There is lot of area for movement. Dedicated places for relaxation and social chatter where you can meet fellow travellers from all across the globe.  One of our nights during our stay though we had a little unpleasant experience. There is a dedicated yogshala in the premises. It was exactly opposite our room no. 103. We had had a tiring day and went to sleep around 2230hrs, few",Jhalak,/Profile/jhalak2019,"Kochi (Cochin), India",40

tehri-gharwal,"This Hostel is unique. All the rooms and dorms, comun area, kitchen, reception are in the ground floor. The rooms looks like villages all with big windows and a small varanda. Everybody met everybody, but at the same time you feel totally free. Staff 5 stars. The food delicious. The location it's super convenient, close to the bridge and to all the best restaurants, but it's in the quite side of the river.  They even have an amazing yoga class every morning for 1,4$ three times less than everywhere else and really good and complete. I loved to stay here so much that this will be always my home in Rishikesh.  Definitely recommend it.",liza martins,/Profile/martinsliza,"Lisbon, Portugal",50

tehri-gharwal,"More than one month I stayed in a mixed dorm at my Rishikesh home the Indian Culture Hostel. Located behind the car park on Laxman Juhla Road it is a hidden gem. Ilona and Sankalp, their staff and four dogs are going to be your family while you stay there and help you enjoy the stay! The chef is amazing and cold evenly well! You hey better did than in the local restaurants. Let them  serve you breakfast, chai, or dinner at the room or wherever you are on the property for a delicious and nutritious meal. In the common area there is plenty of space to hang out or follow the sport on a big screen. And something is always happening! You will make friends and have a great time.
