tehri-gharwal,"I with my sis and mom stayed at Kanatal club mahindra for 2 nights in Nov last week.. Its a huge property with a good location. It has ample amount of space for Car parking, huge entertainment/fun/activity zone with Karoke (which we enjoyed a lot and hence started expecting it to be at all CM properties) , badminton, TT, chess,ludo, cards etc. The activities carried out in the evening by the hosts were fun and interesting. It has a gym with basic amenities and superb view. Food as usual is over costly at CM properties and hence we always hogged at the small adjacent eating joints. There are not much options nearby but just two small eateries to sit and eat. Monkeys are a problem in the entire of Uttarakhand and so was the case in kanatal as well. So u cannot enjoy the balcony",rmarkar,/Profile/rmarkar,"Thane, India",40

tehri-gharwal,Uttrakhand has natural beauty and hence many lovely places to stay. But Club Mahindra Kanatal was beyond horrible. Let me start with the rooms the paint is peeling and there is leakage thru the walls which has been left unattended. The rooms and property are old hence don't feel fresh.  All room balconies have to be kept permanently kept locked as the place is infested with monkeys this problem does not exist in other properties in Kanatal. However as Mahindra guys leave  their left over food in tbe open near the property they have a huge monkey menace. The bathroom plumbing stinks hence has an odour at any given point of time. All the linen is atleast 35 years old and rough with wear.  The bathroom has hot water for a few hours in the morning and evening rest of the day if you,Nishbee,/Profile/Nishbee,"Mumbai, India",10

Good bar too. Cleanliness 4.5. Extraordinary cultural performance by the staff was a great bonus.  Cons- Hot water only from 7-10 morning and evening due to environmental constraints.

tehri-gharwal,We were a family of 2 adults and 2 kids. Stayed for 3 nights. The property is not very huge which is understandable given its on a hill side. Just opposite the resort is a nature walk. It made our stay completely worth it. About 1.5 km ahead there was lots of snow! Kids had a fab time. Other than that there is not much to do. The resort staff is great and put in a lot of efforts to make your stay worth while. But one disturbing trend I am seeing is the charges at these places (all Club Mahindra Resorts). Every activity is chargeable. Hardly anything for free. It's becoming a money spinning machine. They need to review this urgently at all their resorts.

Just outside the property is a forested area that can lead to quite a few delightful walks that are quite safe. You can easily go on your own though if unsure, it may be worth paying 300 INR per person that the resort charges for an early morning two-hour walk. There is ample free parking. Open space is a bit limited but that is understandable considering that it is on the hillside. The cons: 1. Poor maintenance of the rooms and the property: It looks worn out.

tehri-gharwal,"Monkeys are a ‘big menace’ here as has been clearly stated by the resort, but there are no preparations against them. One cannot step on to the room’s balcony due to the threat of monkeys barging into your rooms. Due to this, the balcony door has to always be shut. There is no ventilation system in the room, which makes it very suffocating throughout the day. Grills can be placed around the balcony to not only prevent the entry of monkeys, but also get fresh air for someone coming from a polluted city.   The food is very expensive. For two days, our food bill touched Rs 12,000. It can be made cheaper, knowing that taxes are being added to the bill. One has to eat at the dhabhas outside.

Only drawback that I found was that the rooms do not have any grills or metal mesh for the doors and windows. Due to menace of monkeys, that means the balcony is useless. Can't open the doors and the rooms become dingy due to lack of fresh air.

A couple of caveats: Firstly: the time taken for reach the resort from Dehradun/ airport is about 4-5 hours and the road through Narendra Nagar is very bad due to lane widening(an ecological disaster). If you're planning this visit as a circuit along with Mussoorie please remember that in winter the direct road does get blocked due to snow which may throw your schedule out.    Secondly:  Not much to do here - one can make a visit to Tehri dam or Surkanda temple but otherwise tough to spend more than two days at best.

Monkeys attack you. They try to snatch things from you.  2. if you are going on your own vehicle then you have to take care of it of your own.

Our trip got ruined as I was clawed by a monkey on my forehead as I sat in my balcony in the morning enjoying the sunrise and I escaped being bitten as well  .

Actually we kept thinking let’s first get out of this jam and then make a stopover however the jams was never ending.  Kanatal in itself is a nice place and Club Mahindra Kanatal property is also fine however the journey is not worth it and should be avoided if possible. The route is heavily congested – it’s bad then the Delhi traffic jams during peak hours and stresses you too much – one can hardly take the feet off the clutch and the breaks– the problem starts from Mangalore (a small town before Roorkee).",Bhawna2001,/Profile/Bhawna2001,Delhi,30

Having said this, the property does carry typical Mahindra resort signature albeit scoring low on trained personnel, be it food, hospitality, other facilities or entertainers.

The staff members were extremely courteous and attentive but the floor of the room was dusty and bathroom floor could be cleaner. I tried the spa and the masseuse was very good.

If I remember correctly, the towns closest to the resort are Chamba and Dhanaulti, which are both between 15 and 17 kms away. As a result, there is clear seclusion, but the environment is pristine.   It is a tiny resort in comparison to the others I have visited (Kodaikanal-Hill Country, which was an overall disappointment, and Coorg). Therefore, I found it more homely. The service at Kanatal has been top-notch, more personal and attentive.    Our trip lasted 3 days in the last week of Feb ’14, and we found some snow in Kodia jungle and on our way to Mussoorie.

It is a small resort (37 rooms in total) and the drive in the mountains from Rishikesh is 2.5 to 3 hours long. The resort is clean and well-maintained and has all requisite amenities.

They were ever willing to accommodate our requests - be it change of rooms, special meal requests, access to the kids facilities after routine hours, and small complimentary services.

tehri-gharwal,"Before I begin let me warn you, dear reader, that Ihave a long list of complaints and am taking the liberty of being more cynical than normal.  To begin, it is located about 92 kms away from Haridwar up in the hills at around 6000 feet.The drive is beautiful and it was a refreshing 32 degrees in the peak of summer and the property is located right in the middle of beautiful hills with pine trees. As in you walk into the lobby which is designed to be a Swiss chalet, you will be quite impressed and find yourself looking up at the large Deodar wood panelling, And after checking in, find your room modestly comfortable. But the mini bar is VERY EMPTY there isn’t even water. Alas, the goodness stops here.  The lobby and rooms are in separate blocks of the property and as I made my way",roshangupta1,/Profile/roshangupta1,"New Delhi, India",10
tehri-gharwal,"The month of November and the pine forests of Kanatal, with a distant view of the snow covered Himalayas. The perfect romantic setting.   The Kanatal resort actually advertises itself as a SPA resort, and they do have some nice SPA facilities in there, with a very relaxing ambiance. All we did, as a trial, was a foot massage, which lasted for about 30 mins, but the experience was worth the trial. Not only was the masseur good, but the combination of soft classical music and the beautiful interiors with dim lighting, was lethal! I think I did catch a nap while the foot massage was on! And, my parameter says.. that if you fall asleep during a massage, then it was GOOD!  But it was not the SPA treatment that fascinated us at Kanatal.. we stayed there for 4 days, and what we loved",Ruchi_S,/Profile/Ruchi_S,New Delhi,50

tehri-gharwal,"We stopped in here for 2 nights when travelling between Mussoorie and Rishikesh. We just passed it on the road and decided it looked pretty good. There are some other properties around, but they are pretty run down, and the other 5-star place wasn't nearly as friendly as these guys so we decided to stay at this one.  It is 5-star quality in terms of hardware, but still with nice touches of India throughout in terms of friendly but not quite switched on staff, strange room allocations, ie put all guests in 5 adjoining rooms instead of spreading them across the property,  and general noise from workmen at strange times, ie early in the morning. but these are minor points, we really enjoyed the stay here.  one tip: we asked for the lowest category and they bumped us up to middle",shannon66,/Profile/shannon66,Hong Kong,40
tehri-gharwal,"The tariff charged does not match upto the food quality. The food was horrible and some dishes were repeated daily. The promoters have spend good money on the interiors of the hotel but they need professionally trained management to run the hotel. The website shows heated swimming pool and depicts a big size pool but the sign board outside the pool says ""no swimming only relaxing"" in a very small area.  Very small open area for kids to play. Jaypee is anyday better.",dabbu_1Delhi,/Profile/dabbu_1Delhi,Delhi,20

tehri-gharwal,"Kanatal Spa and Resorts is a newly opened resort in Kanatal, India. Kanatal is an offbeat place and a nice place to go and spend weekend with family and friends.  The resort is made in a very artistic way. Its a new resort and opened 2 months back only. The rooms are done in a very nice manner. The toilets are ok. The entrance is nice and warm.  What I didnot like about the resort is that the hot water pool is open for only 4 hrs in a day. Thats real bad for the price you pay. You are paying 5 star rates and getting 3 star service. The food is also not upto the mark. Some food items are good and some are not. The staff needs proper training and needs to be equipped to handle customers in a fair manner. The toilets were stinking during our stay. Next day another lady complained",Prashant,/Profile/prashantgarg78,"Kolkata, India",20
