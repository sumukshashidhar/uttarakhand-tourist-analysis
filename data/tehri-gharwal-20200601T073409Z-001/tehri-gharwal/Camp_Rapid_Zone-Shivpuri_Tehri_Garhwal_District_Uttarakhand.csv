tehri-gharwal,"I was in camp rapid zone last week e4nd with my friends. we are  a group of 15 girls and we book it from Delhi office. The camp location is very good on river Ganga. Beach of the camp is very huge. First we we are very affraid about the security reason beause we are only girl but after reaching there we get rid of our fear. tents are neat & clean, food was very good. As the reservation staff told we got all the things. We was on our adventure trip and camp rapid zone made our trip life time memorable. We was there for 02 nights & 03 days. In short if you are going for camping & rafting than this camp was excellent for girls. The best part of the trip is evening, bonfire, beach games & rafting. I also advice to all my friends to go there once there and feel the nature .",Maddy0003,/Profile/Maddy0003,"Delhi, Delhi, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"Stayed here with my Husband  .It was very comfortable and of very good value. Camp were beautiful and the staff at  camp  ground were very courteous and i would surely stay here again  This was the first  rafting experience for my family and me- couldn't have asked for a better experience. We travelled with few friends and their families with children. It was an amazing camp where children had a ball..food was great and safety / precuations by being riverside was top notch. With very experienced guides / safety kayaks / safety rafts, our rafting experience was amazingly thrilling and safe at the same time. Wow! i would be strongly recommending this place to everybody and its also just a great place for corporate offsites/ team building activities.  evry1 should visit",vandanasharma12,/Profile/vandanasharma12,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",50

tehri-gharwal,"I would second the reviews shared by Nikunj. The camp staff needs to drastically improve on 'hospitality'... it seems they have either not heard this word or don't know its meaning.  There was a total failure on commitment... as whatever was promised at the time of booking was never delivered during the stay.. the worst part was a wait of 3.5 hours in harsh sunlight for rafting to begin... simply torturous...   This was my second rafting trip... and based of my good experience of some other camp (I regret remembering the name of that camp) around 10 years back, I was thrilled at the idea of going to a rafting camp along with my family.... but camp rapid zone played a spoil sport....",SachinAsri,/Profile/SachinAsri,New Delhi,10
tehri-gharwal,"Location: The camp location is near Shivpuri (about 15 minutes), they have a board on the road side clearly indicating that you have arrived. The road is at a high level compared to the river bed, hence you need to climb down the hill side and reach the camp. Staff from the camp should be available to carry luggage for you.  Our bad experience begins once we've all reached the camping area. The place is run by half a dozen teenage/early-twenties boys who obviously do not know what they are doing. To get thinigs done, you have to frequently speak on mobile phone (did I mention poor signal reception in the area) to their boss. So as soon as we reach the camp, the first thing the boys ask us is for us to make remainder of payment. We ask them to show us our tents and place our",NikunjShrivastava,/Profile/NikunjShrivastava,"New Delhi, India",10
tehri-gharwal,"This is the perfect palace for hang out with friends. we went to this camp last November for 2 night & 03 days. Location of the camp is very good on beach of River Ganga. Best part of the camp is very big beach side & total private beach. Food is good, They provide us bonfire and snacks till 1100 in the evening. We enjoy for 03 days very good as we wish.
