tehri-gharwal,"First the good points.  This newly built hotel is staffed by a young friendly (albeit untrained) team; management were also friendly and helpful allowing us to check in early.  The hotel is located about a 10 minute walk from Laxman Jula (there is a pleasant short cut at the rear of the hotel thus avoiding the necessity of walking via the congested and dusty main road).    Our bedroom was decorated to a good standard and tastefully furnished.  There was a comfortable bed with clean and good quality bed linen (unfortunately my partner found the bed a little short being over 6 ft tall).  Wi-Fi was fast.     Importantly, the hotel has 24 hour back up generator which certainly comes in handy in Rishikesh!  Our problems arose before check in.  We had booked via booking.com and was",the-marmite-kids,/Profile/the-marmite-kids,UK,30
tehri-gharwal,"Vishla Palace is located in a serene setting right in between the majestic mountains of the Shivalik range. The rooms are comfortable and pleasant. The chef prepares mouth-watering meals that are a treat for your taste buds. The staff are really friendly and helpful.  Overall, an enjoyable stay. Highly recommended if you are in Rishikesh and are looking for a place to stay!",Adi,/Profile/TripDthy,,50
tehri-gharwal,"Set down a quiet lane, the views from this hotel are incredible, especially from the rooftop terrace. The room was one of the nicest we'd stayed in in India with modern clean decor and comfy beds. Staff were lovely and food was very tasty - although options were limited. There is a large yoga hall which was always very popular also. Overall we had a lovely stay here and would recommend.",AvidTraveller546,/Profile/AvidTraveller546,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",50

tehri-gharwal,The hotel is surrounded by hills 360 degrees and that too quite close. Amazing panoramic view from the rooftop. You can hear the sound of Ganga river flowing near by the hotel. Staff is courteous and very helpful. Peaceful atmosphere Only bad part of our stay was the food. Food quality is very average. No salt no spice and no masala in the vegetables. Felt like eating boiled food.Few items were good but few were pretty average. Otherwise a very pleasant stay indeed!,PPriyadarshi,/Profile/PPriyadarshi,"New Delhi, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"Courteous staff, located close to the tourist attractions , good rooms , average food. Free Wifi & yoga hall.

tehri-gharwal,"Stayed with group of 14 students.Very convenient location, near Laxman Jhoola, Clean, hygienic rooms with air conditioning and amenities. Friendly staff, good service.

tehri-gharwal,"My First time visiting India and staying at Vishla Palace Hotel! Got really lucky! Clean, cozy, with great mountain views, only 15 minutes walk to Ganga. The staff is friendly, caring and was always ready to assist with any of my requests. The hotel has a restaurant with a combination of Indian and European food. There is also a great restaurant just a few minutes away with a great selection of healthy organic food. Vishla Hotel is located next to Anand Prakash Yoga Ashram which has a variety of activities such as yoga classes, meditations, Agni, kirtan. I had an unforgettable trip to India and part of it due to a wonderful stay at Vishla Palace Hotel!!!",Tatiana S,/Profile/Y7720LWtatianas,,50

tehri-gharwal,"I had the pleasure of staying at Vishla Palace for almost two weeks, just a week after the hotel had opened, and I had a wonderful time here. I highly recommend it and will definitely stay here again next time I visit Rishikesh.   My room was extremely nice, with new and beautiful furniture at a level that I hadn't seen in other hotels at this price range during my travels. The bed was one of the most comfortable ones I've slept in in 3 months of travel in India. Everything is very new and clean, and rooms have everything that you need - hot water, tv, wifi. I had a great little balcony with a view to the mountains. Everything is very clean and comfortable.   The location is perfect - It is in a quiet area in Tapovan, which means you are 5 minutes walk from some of the best",GreenwellIL,/Profile/GreenwellIL,"Tel Aviv, Israel",50

tehri-gharwal,"Everything is quite new in the room. Price, internet and location very good. Hot water on shower! Most importantly, they're kind and respect reservations (I also got a discount!). I tried 2 hotels on Tapovan and noone was better than Vishla. Thank you guys!",Eduardo F,/Profile/B191QGeduardof,,50
