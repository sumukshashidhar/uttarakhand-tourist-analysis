tehri-gharwal,"Stayed a couple of weeks. In this time received no fresh bed linen EVEN after requesting. No fresh towels either. The staff pretended they‚Äôd run out. Water heater didn‚Äôt work at all so cold showers the whole time. Cafe is mediocre. Not open all the time. Sometimes they didn‚Äôt have change when I paid for food but never got reimbursed. Staff hung around smoking weed. Evenings are hellish if you‚Äôre trying to sleep, due to the constant parties that happen on the roof.",Hughdunitt,/Profile/Hughdunitt,,20

tehri-gharwal,I've been traveling for some years and this is definitely the grandest most amazing hostel I've been to. 5 floors plus a rooftop cafe coming soon. You don't even have to be a guest to participate in the activities. Come see for yourself and if you'd like to stay try and book in advance.,Ziggy f,/Profile/242ziggyf,,50
tehri-gharwal,"I stayed here for one week, and gosh, how I enjoyed it! The hostel is brand new, so everything is pretty shiny and new. Every room comes with a balcony with an amazing view! It's totally worth it. And the staff, they were so wonderful and helpful. Planning to return to Rishikesh and definitely will stay in this place. Thumbs up!",DanielaVasiljeva,/Profile/DanielaVasiljeva,"Almeria, Spain",50
tehri-gharwal,"This is my third time staying at Into the unknown and i will most probably be back. Not only is it the cheapest place to stay in Rishikesh but the quality standards and cleanliness are the best. Located in the heart of Tapovan but tucked away from the noise, its a perfect place to call home. With an amazing rooftop view, also perfect for doing morning yoga, and the super friendly staff that are always available to help out in any way. Throw in the free water points, delicious food and easy services makes this is a place hard to beat.",J√∫lio M,/Profile/572j_liom,,50
tehri-gharwal,"It was a short stay with the purpose to regain my energies and peace at Rishikesh and was searching for a perfect stay and somehow got into this property. I can say that it was one of the best experiences with their fully ventilated rooms, good view to river Ganga, proximity to Laxman jhoola, supportive staff and large parking space. I recommend this property for perfect stay.",Pramod Y,/Profile/PramodY74,,50
tehri-gharwal,"With a 100 beds, Into the unknown is India's largest hostel. Built by travelers and for travelers, this place is literally home away from home. It's surprising how this place is located so close to where all the action is and yet is quaint and quiet. The magic of the hills perhaps. The rooms are spacious and you don't get a feeling that you're sharing with so many. Every one has their personal locker and your things are most certainly safe. From families to couples to friend groups to solo travelers, this place has something for everyone and depending on your availability and how much you want to spend, you get to chose rooms from ac to non ac and attached balcony or without. The huge property has 4 floors and a lift to make life easier and a kickass terrace with a cafe and",utopish,/Profile/utopish,"New Delhi, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"We have been in Into The Unknown Hostel for three days. Is a very new place but the staff is full of energy. They helped us in everything. Also they bought a bus tickets in internet for us. The place is still under construction but I can see it will be a great hostel. The rooms are very simple but has a nice balcony. The location is good, near Laxmi Jula. I reccommend to stay here.",CaminandoPorElGlobo,/Profile/CaminandoPorElGlobo,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",50
