tehri-gharwal,i found no negative point in this property. location best. from here one can see artistic Hills and valley. Manager and staff are cooperative. food is good. there is little open space for kids too. recommended.,Ramesh Rai,/Profile/rameshrrai,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,Very bad attitude by the hotel staff who was there to book my reservation...very very bad experience..I paid 1000 as advance money by Paytm and also confirmed that in case of any issue it should be refundable and staff (Vinod) was agree. But now the staff is not picking my call and not responding. If you choose this hotel make sure to discuss this otherwise u can seriously face troubles. I have very bad experience and I will make sure to spread this feedback everywhere.,Sanjeev K,/Profile/SanjeevK1261,,10
tehri-gharwal,"I would like to highlight the location of this resort - away from the crowd, in the lap of nature. The views from the resort is beautiful. On top of this, I would like to mention the hospitality of the staff. We received good accommodation. The room was spacious with adequate amenities to beat the cold. And if one enjoys well-cooked homemade like food, then this will be worth trying.",Aniruddha D,/Profile/142aniruddhad,,50

tehri-gharwal,"Stayed there for a night in Two Bedroom Cottage. There was a living area in the cottage connected with the two bedrooms. Both the bedrooms have attached toilets.  Rooms were clean and very spacious. Bed was very comfortable as well. Beautiful view from the balcony and room window were very refreshing.  Resort has many more things to offer like Play activities, Camp Fire, Observation Deck.  Staff was very helpful and polite. Food was good and freshly cooked.  Do carry enough cash while visiting these hill stations as ATMs are very far from Dhanaulti (Either in Mussoori or Chamba). The two ATMs in Chamba were empty. Most hotels and Resorts ( Almost all ) accept only cash payment here in Dhanaulti. Thankfully staff on both our resorts was really helpful.",GauravDhaka,/Profile/GauravDhaka,"Noida, India",50

Staff is very helpful. Food is good. Good view of Himalayan range. Suitable for group of 2-3 families.,VijayBansal,/Profile/VijayBansal,Delhi,50
tehri-gharwal,"It is not a luxurious hotel, but, is very calm and fresh. The staff are helpful. A few of the rooms are a bit small, but if you can get a family room, slightly larger, then it is totally satisfactory. The breakfasts are good, and economical, not exciting or a great deal of choice, but enough to give one a good start to the day. Don't forget to visit Eco Park when you stay here, the place is 5 minutes from the hotel. I would visit the place again, it suits my purposes, location is great and it is comfortable.",hemant d,/Profile/936hemantd,,40
tehri-gharwal,"When we decided to go to Mussoorie, we thought of spending two nights in a nearby peaceful and scenic place. We booked Green Forest Resort in Dhanaulti and after staying there we realized that we made an excellent decision. The place is about 3Km from the Eco Park and on the main road so there were not much of problems in locating the Resort. The Resort is simply superb and fairly well organized! It is a very peaceful place overlooking the Himalayan Range. We were enjoying the mesmerizing, gigantic and tranquil view of the Mountains from our rooms and balcony throughout the day. The day we were leaving the Resort, the sky was clear and we could see the snow capped mountain peaks like Trishul, Nanda Devi etc. and all of us were very happy.  We took two rooms on the first floor,",Deb Banerjee,/Profile/DebBanerjee,Bangalore,50

tehri-gharwal,"I zeroed in on this resort after seeing the pics coz this is exactly what i prefer on my vacations, secluded location with great views and as close to nature as possible. Let me assure you the pics do full justice to the place. We stayed here for 2 days (june end) and loved it.  The resort is located 2 kms before dhanaulti centre/eco park and the location is perfect. It has a slight dowhill approach but its easily manageable. Its well maintained and has been planned in a way so that each cottage has its own privacy. It gives you a feel of a homestay with all the luxuries you'll expect from a good resort. The view from the resort is breathtaking.

Its an uninterrupted view. And you also see the amazing valley down below. 2.	This cottage costed me Rs.8K for each night. A little expensive, but still worth it. 3.	The staff is courteous and very friendly. Suresh-Bhai and Mukesh-Bhai were friendly and yet not intrusive. Very helpful with punctured tyre of my car. 4.

tehri-gharwal,We had reached Dhanaulti in the freezing early morning of 24th December 2015. It was totally dark at 5:30 am. Somehow we spotted the board of the resort at the roadside and took the correct turn. The reception was closed as expected. We called up the mobile no. of the manager. Only Vodafone was working. After 3 attempts he picked up. We had to wait 15-20 minutes for a guy to come up. We were huddled inside the car as it was literally freezing outside. They carried our luggage to our cottage and left us. We had no option but to get under 2 blankets with all our sweaters and get a nap till the morning as we had taken an overnight bus from Delhi and could manage very little sleep en route.

tehri-gharwal,"The location of this resort is superb. We stayed at the main 3BHK cottage and the views right outside the door was amazing. probably the best that you can get in Dhanulti. Rooms are below average, with lots of dust etc. The service was good but slow. Food was authentic home cooked pahadi style so 5 points for that. I would recommend staying in this hotel only if you are looking for silence and solitude.

We had occupied all three bedrooms of one unit and it was like living in a private house. However resort is very poorly maintained.

The resort is located at a very nice scenic location. But the walking path from parking to main cottage is very rough. They were provided us the hand towel & hand wash shop after many reminders. Room was clean but bathroom was not cleaned & cigarette remains were lying there. The day we reached at resort it was raining all day so the weather was very cool. There was no hot water supply when we asked the guys they said they will start the hot water soon but even after hours there was no hot water.

The whole cluster of rooms is build on a plateau with no other habitat around for miles. I believe that's the beauty of the place.  We were the only guest at that time. The serenity of the location and beautiful scenic landscape was so engrossing that we spent whole afternoon outdoors. The staff was local yet professional.   The rooms are well architected and inside you'll feel home and warm. The best part is the food. They serve you hot, make sure it stays hot, and ofcourse delicious.
