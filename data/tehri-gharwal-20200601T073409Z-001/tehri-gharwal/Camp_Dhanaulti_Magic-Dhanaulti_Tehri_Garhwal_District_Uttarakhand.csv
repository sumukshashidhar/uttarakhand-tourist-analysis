tehri-gharwal,"Headed to Camp Dhanaulti magic in december second week for 2 days Huawei corpoate team building trip. We stayed for one night two days and had an amazing experience. Location is amazing with a great view of whole dhanaulti. All basic amenties were available. Rooms were basically Bamboo cottages and were perfectly clean and cozy. Food was ok, they tried their best to serve hot food but then it was 2 degrees outside! For fun, we had few games and activities and also a dance party. Overall a great place to visit to rejuvenate. Nice trip",Pranav_agrahari,/Profile/Pranav_agrahari,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50

tehri-gharwal,"Camp Dhanaulti Magic is located about 6 km before Dhanaulti.. But guys what a view from the camp ABSOLUTELY BREATHTAKING.... what else you want when you wake up with such amazing view . otherwise also the food was fine since we came in december so cant expect absolutly hot food. The care taker of the camps were really nice and courtious and always ready to help.. for a day or 2 the place is really nice. camps quality is also very good very clean and neat. in the morning you can take natural hot water from the care taker for wash and change. review will not justify the beauy of the experience do visit and experience,",EktaPathak,/Profile/EktaPathak,"New Delhi, India",50

tehri-gharwal,"The camp is 3 km from Dhanaulti town and is at a very serene location. The bamboo huts are neat and clean and the staff is also very helpful. You will experience a great sunrise here.  Some things to note: - It is very cold here in peak winters. They provide hot water and multiple blankets, but do carry your woolens. - All meals/snacks are included in their tariff. Food is average but feels homely. - The staff is very greedy for tips, so keep that in mind. - The place provides bonfire and DJ for you to have fun in the evening. It's good!  Overall, a good place to be for a weekend outing.",Varitant G,/Profile/varitantg,"Ann Arbor, Michigan",40
tehri-gharwal,The experience was very bad. Here are the things that are poor  1. No heating facility in the Huts  2. No hot water in washrooms  3. No electric kettle in rooms  4. No facility to provide hot water for drinking  5. No soap in washrooms  6. Water ran out in washrooms in the night  7. No view from the huts and tents  8. No entertainment provided  9. No adventure facility  It was a horrible experience. The camp is located at a very average place with no view of the valley at all. It was very cold in the night but they don't even provide room heater in rooms. We were 4 friends in one hut and we stayed awake whole night due to bitter cold.   There was not even a soap in the bathroom. Do they expect the guests to bring along their own toilet paper or soap for toilet?  They didnt even,Naturelover7777,/Profile/Naturelover7777,Dehradun,10
tehri-gharwal,"Its such a vry vry bad camp...  Boring,  useless, unsightly, no Facility,  No adventure, not good food facilities,  Sleeping arrangements is very very bad,  Tents in the rain is dripping... Bla bla bla üëøüëøüëø",khurapati,/Profile/khurapati,,10
tehri-gharwal,"1. ‚ÄúCamp Calista‚Äù was renamed as ‚ÄúCamp Dhanaulti Magic‚Äù when it changed hands from one owner to the next. They are one and the same. I however see different reviews under the two names.  2. All Camp owners have joined hands to raise their prices similar to the hotels and resorts, which have spent lot of money in doing the construction and landscaping. These camps are nice, but do not deserve to be at even half the price. They charged us Rs.2K for each person. So 8K per night for 4 of us. ‚ÄúGreen forest Resorts‚Äù located within the same premises, provide much much better facilities. 3. The beds and the sheets looks shabby to say the least. 4. Water taps and running water available in each tent. 5. Food is average and not bad actually. If you have a car, you may go and explore",Soumen N,/Profile/S0umenN,Delhi,20
tehri-gharwal,We went there on 30th Dec. The first look of the place makes you a bit skeptical about the safety for solo couples but really nothing to worry about. It gets too chilly in the night so opt for some other accommodation if you come from a hot state like Gujarat or South. They do not have many facilities but the staff makes up for that. They set good service standards within limited resources and the place itself is pretty scenic. They have a huge lawn upfront where you can have bonfire and have some pretty decent food. Off season and advance booking can get you better discounts on the tariff.,Shrawan09,/Profile/Shrawan09,"Ahmedabad, India",40

tehri-gharwal,"This was our first experience of camping and was made memorable by camp magic. Location is just awesome, if you want to track or if you want to stay in peace for both this is just the best. They will serve you as if you are their family member. So much warmth and love in their service you really feel special. The quality and quantity of food is so great. I strongly recommended this stay in this camp. They also have arrangement of camp fire and dj. Camps have attached toilet. During our stay it rained throughout the night but camps are totally water proof. Full safty and security. They will accomodate all ur needs to the best possible extent. We ll look forwad to next visit here.",poonamnegi,/Profile/poonamnegi,,50
