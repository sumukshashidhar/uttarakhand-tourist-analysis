tehri-gharwal,"Words to describe the place- Beautiful, Serene, calm and amazing hospitality by Vansh(owner) and Jeetsingh ji.  I visited the palce on 26 Oct 18 and was given a warm welcome by Vansh. He gave me a property tour and introduced me to his staff. The tent that was alloted to me was clean and cosy. It had all the basic amenities and comfort. They grow fruits and veggies and Jeetsingh ji does the magic in kitchen with freshly plucked products. In the evening bonfire was arranged by Vansh and there i came to know how good a singer he is. I was lucky to visit the place during full moon which made my experience even more special. The sky looks so clear and close. The place is also a treasure for bird watchers as there are over 90 varities of birds visiting the vicinity. I really enjoyed",ajaychandra_08,/Profile/ajaychandra_08,"Amritsar, India",50

Its nestled in the jungle overlooking the mountains with spectacular view. The temprature jn the night dropped to appox 16 degrees. The camp is well planned and amenities are really good. The host is very polite,  full of life and oversees all the arrangements. After a bon fire we had dinner with soft music. The night sky was great. We could see stars with background music of night life. We had peaceful and comfy sleep. This place has excellent food, important when you are travelling. Trees laden with fruits was awesome. Overall a good experience. The air was pure and clean- wish I could get it back in a bottle. Spring water was great",Praveen,/Profile/avee99,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50

I was there with my family and my kids enjoyed a lot as they spotted rare birds, flora, etc.; the place is full of fruit trees of astonishing variety. The quality of tents is excellent and the meal offered is really a treat for the palate. Stay at the property has left a permanent mark onto my psyche. The treks are superb and give a panoramic view.

tehri-gharwal,"We went for a family trip to this place in March last week which was a long weekend. It was a newly developed place with great hospitality by the owner. Food quality is excellent and can be customized as per demand. Basically there are Camps on the hillside away from city in the lap of nature. The day temperature is around 20 degrees while night temperature falls to 8 degrees. The camps have electricity connection with attached washrooms. The whole area is secured from wildlife by barbed wire fence. Electricity backup is also there. Lots of group fun activity can be done including Trekking, Bird Watching, Photography, etc. Tehri Lake is hardly 20 kms away (less than 1 hour drive) where water sports can be enjoyed.  In evening there is bonfire with Music.  It's not like a usual",Ankur Agarwal,/Profile/drankur77,"Noida, India",50
