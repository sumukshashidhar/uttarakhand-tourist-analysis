tehri-gharwal,Location of the hotel is excellent. New building rooms are very good particularly T V Room. Good view from Balcony. Food in restaurant is very good. Eco park is very close to the hotel.  Rooms are highly overpriced. Beds are not good. Staff is short resulting in poor service. ,permod c,/Profile/permodc,,30
