tehri-gharwal,"The rooms are neat and good. Its very near to Laxman Jhula. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Even though the bus stand is at some distance, it is en route to Badrinath. So you can get all the buses from near the hotel itself. Would definitely recommend it.  NB: The area is filled with stray dogs at night. Would recommend an early checkin.",Midhun Jayaraj,/Profile/MidhunJayaraj,"Thalassery, India",50
