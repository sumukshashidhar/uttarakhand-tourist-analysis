tehri-gharwal,"We have enjoyed the stayed in Camp Majestic Shivpuri We were group of 8 friends to enjoyed the two days fullest.  Campsite is very beautiful. Big lawn for games, there are flushed loos attached with Camp, some cemented shades for food areas. But it still holds up on the wilderness and calmness, Camp is located just near to River Stream at Shivpuri with a Shaandar valley view & covered by beautiful mountain, evening bonfire & some gupsup with friends was the best part of our camping experience. Food was delicious, riverside trekking with guide gajendra was the experience of life time, The highpoint of the trip was a wonderful raft trip which permitted us to see the unspoiled white sand beaches and stunning nature of the mighty ganga. Also, I would like to give my special thanks",Anuradha_Breathing,/Profile/Anu_19901,"Mumbai, India",50
