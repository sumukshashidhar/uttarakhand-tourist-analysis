tehri-gharwal,"Hello, So we drove from haridwar to apple orchard which is 105 kms of which 55kms of drive is mountain driving which will take you approx 1hrs 45 minutes of driving zig zag. So this hotel doesn't have fan even so u can imagine the temperature of this place at night even in June. The owner and the guy who manages saurabh is a wonderful person who gave us rooms happily even before check in timings. He was super courteous. We visited sarkanda temple and eco Park. The main thing we regretted was only booking room for 1 day and not 2 days. We booked valley facing rooms and the drive and view of the rooms will mesmerize you. So would the ir food quality and quantity at the price. Such nicely cooked chicken hats off to the chef. Definitely will visit here again. Rooms are very nice and",Kshtjsngh61,/Profile/Kshtjsngh61,,40

tehri-gharwal,I stayed at Apple Orchard resort on 18th June'18. As requested to the manager Mr. Rajesh we got the 2 rooms on the ground floor. This was great help since my mother could not climb stairs. The resort is beautiful and has great views of the mountains and the valley. The food is really very good. We had 2 rooms and my kids enjoyed the open space in front of the rooms and we could see the apples hanging from the tree. The staff is very courteous. The rooms were clean but there is scope for improvement. Apart from this everything was very nice and we enjoyed our stay.

tehri-gharwal,"I visited there on mid June with my wife and my kid. To be precise let me state pros and cons of this place directly -   Pros -  1. Nice view. 2. Lot of space.  Cons -  . Poor cleaning in rooms . Intercom were not working - When I visited intercom were not working. If you even have to order tea, go to reception and order it yourself. . Network coverage was poor. Most of the times there is no network coverage at rooms. . WIFI not working. I stayed for 3 days and it was not working for whole 3 days. I don't even know if it works or not. . No card payment - Please carry enough cash as Dhanaulti don't have ATM's. . No one in reception in night to help you - During my stay one guest came to check in at night around 1:00 AM.

tehri-gharwal,"First And Foremost - Please avoid the suites Room number 114 & 115.  The experience has been based on the rooms. The rooms are too tacky and cheesy. More over they are dark, and the beds did not look clean. They also had quite a few insects around.  Another thing is that do get your rates confirmed as per the rooms to avoid any confusion later. There was a difference in the rates quoted and then what asked for when it reached. So better take confirmation before so as to avoid any difference later.  The food was ok nothing to complain about or to recommend. However the speed of service was good.  Probably rooms at the top are better.  View - nothing great to talk about.

I had a chance to talk to the  owner oover the phone who is bright and pleasent to talk with.  I assume he would rarely visits his property amd that is why it is in shambles.. more or less.

A pleasent scenic view of the mountains from this location that made me almost check inn.  6. Clean washroom 7. Smiling staff  Downside 1.

tehri-gharwal,Points to ponder 1. Resort rooms are dirty and not at all up to the mark of 4500 per day.. snaps are self explanatory. May be room cleaning dosent involve the floor cleaning. 2. Promises are made in abundance but just to make it. Mechanism ia missing actually to fulfill the same. 3. Hot water is a scarcity. Management said hot water geyser is of old fashion which do not shut automatically on a set temp so have to keep it close and only to be turned on when asked. Such water geyser were made ages ago.  4. Room heaters needs to be demanded at extra cost of 300 Rs per day. Even the heater given on day one could hardly work as it was just for warm summer and ao tiny in size. They did give us a bigger heater next day when confronted. 5.

Location of the resort is about 1-2 km from main dhanaulti and towards chamba.    The view from the rooms was very nice. The manager Mr. Rajan Bhandari was exceptional. The dinner and breakfast service was very good. The hotel had its own parking facilities and was very safe.   There were some swings for the children and the glass enclosed restaurant was very nice. Rooms were large and airy, the complementary toiletries could have been better.  Overall a nice clam play to stay with family.

The owner & his family hails from royal family and I'm thankful to them for giving an upgrade to a suite. I didn't like the dark/red interiors of the suite initially but having checked the deluxe room, I decided to accept the upgrade. There is no problem with the deluxe room but the suite was slightly better located with a balcony in front. The resort staff is friendly but they need to pay attention to the details. Wet towels in a suite are not acceptable! Food was average. I have one regret that I could not enjoy the bon fire on a",Ras_Baijal,/Profile/Ras_Baijal,New Delhi,30
tehri-gharwal,"I love the APPLE ORCHARD RESORT. I have been many times and never come back disappointed.  Pro's: Location - It's located in one of the most peaceful places in India,  a far cry from the madness of Mussoorie. Perfect for a relaxing getaway. Beautiful property - They do a great job of maintaining the property. It's rustic and beautiful at the same time. It's one of the best heritage properties I've seen. Great food - You would be hard pressed to find such so many tasty options anywhere in Delhi, much less in the middle of the mountains. I always leave impressed with the food. Comfortable beds - The beds are very comfortable, soft with big fluffy pillows. Great staff - The staff is well trained, fast and courteous.  Con's:  You'll have a hard time finding a better value anywhere.",bhandari007,/Profile/bhandari007,bombay,50
tehri-gharwal,"A nice location to stay at. Staff was helpful and friendly, though service and food was average. Rooms were ok. The view from the room and restaurant was very good. There is good parking space. Over all presentation of the resort’s staff and services was average.",Akanksha S,/Profile/Akki0503,"Pune, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"We only stayed one night.  We found the staff friendly but the place is in a poor state of repair and untidy with litter and pealing paint work.  Its still worth a stay for the location but the food was awful, the staff inefficient and the place was generally untidy with half finished repairs and son on.  It needs the owner to visit to check what is going on because there really isn't much going on in terms of quality.  It is a very location for going for walks on the unpaved road through the coniferous forest.  A great place for birdwatchers.  In the room TV didn't work (not that I care to watch but my son wanted to see something).  Its there so it should work.  The rooms had furniture too large for ease of moving around.  The bathroom was dirty and everywhere around the hotel",Lokamitra,/Profile/Lokamitra,"Vadodara, India",20
tehri-gharwal,"This was on the same trip as Chakrata. & Dhanaulti is a much larger town in comparision. We could not travel in this location, we just spent a night at this place. Actually, AOR is possibly the farthest down the road. One of our friends had sprained his ankle, & after asking around & checking many a facility, when we reached here, he was totally exhausted. We had to stay here. There was snow on the cliff walls & on the roofs of the hotel. The restaurant is picture perfect - a glass structure hanging on the cliff at the face of the hotel, all warm-glow-y from its decor & lighting. Food was okay, nothing great. Rooms ARE filthy. Under normal circumstances, I won't sleep on those sheets, nor take those quilts, but I said to myself, ""What the heck, I'm wearing so many layers, I'll",dedestined,/Profile/dedestined,"Kanpur, India",20
