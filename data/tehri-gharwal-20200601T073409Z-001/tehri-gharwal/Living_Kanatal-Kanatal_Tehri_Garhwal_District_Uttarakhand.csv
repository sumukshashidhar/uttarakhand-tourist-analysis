tehri-gharwal,I have been to kanatal for one day trip. Scenery of this place is quite mesmerizing and like any other hill station. Those who have never been to mountains and hill station can surely go to this place. But people belong to hill station will found it overrated.  For me it was ok ok.

tehri-gharwal,"This place is almost between forest, very peaceful, lush green & unexplored. Tent & food is awesome, and tent folks are helping and nice, they try to accomodate all the possible request happily. We have done few activities as well & enjoyed a lot. the view is just awesome and worth to stay.  Mr Anil is highly professional in hospitality and mountaineer too.",Komal P,/Profile/KomalP219,,50
tehri-gharwal,"Cringe worthy is the phrase that describes this horrible worst excuse for a camping site.   We were a couple of friends who booked a dome camp for 1 night after reading reviews here. However, everything was just the opposite in reality. Here are the cons:  1. Location: Location is bad. They claim that they are situated in Kodia jungle but in reality, they are just off-road and you need to park your car on an extreme steep curve.  2. Views: You get to see no mountain peaks or any great views from here. It's a simple location and nothing is great over here.  3. Site: I have camped elsewhere as well but never in my life I have come across a camping site this small. There are just 7 Swiss cottages (that's what they call these) cramped together with no sense of privacy. They can",Dev1213,/Profile/Dev1213,"Noida, India",10

tehri-gharwal,"At the outset, let me clarify: I did NOT stay in living kanatal so i do not have any first hand experience of the camp stay. So why am i reviewing this place ???...will let you know While on a long walk in the kodia jungle around evening time from club mahindra kanatal; i chanced upon this place and believe me i was awe-stuck by the panoramic view that this campground offered. the campground and the camps per se appeared pretty functional but the view of the himalayan ranges was by far the very best The other part was the hospitality i received inspite of not being a guest. one of the owners, vijay rawat shared his insight about the various mountain ranges and i promised to come over the next morning Just before sunrise, i went there and WHAT A VIEW!!!...being a clear day i",Mehul M,/Profile/drmvm35,"Mumbai, India",50

tehri-gharwal,"I was there with my Family  in October-15 and it was absolutely one of the most beautiful places in uttrakhand. Awesome Location,The camp is a very  difficult to locate. situated at 8500 Ft. Bandar Ponchh Peak are visible from here. A must visit Place if you are ready to adjust with food quality.the food is fresh but the cook is not enough mature to cook quality food .  Will visit next year.",Kapil K,/Profile/544kapilk,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
tehri-gharwal,"If you are planning to go Kanatal, this should be your place for camping. Living Kanatal is the only camp site which have best view point in Kanatal because it's on the other side of Hill. You can see all snow capped peaks, sunrise while having a cup of tea in your camp. Anil person who takes care of the place is very nice and helpful. Food quality was decent. Try and wake up early to see the Sun rise it's just a bliss..",Prashant015,/Profile/Prashant015,"Noida, India",50
tehri-gharwal,I was there with my friends last year and it was absolutely one of the most beautiful places in uttrakhand. It was really enthralling experience of living near the Himalayas I liked the most is fun activities.,Amit_Khajuria,/Profile/Amit_Khajuria,"Chandigarh, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"Living kanatal is a perfect place to hangout and spend quality times with your loved ones. The camp is located on the cliff facing the snow peak himalayan ranges. The camps were neat and tidy. Suman and Arjun ( Camp Co-ordinators) guided us well to reach the camp site and were always there to assist us. They also had few activities like flying fox, burma bridge etc, which was the fun part. We we lucky enough to view the sunrise because of clear weather. Overall it was more than we expected. Will plan a visit again..!",Aman_Negi,/Profile/Aman_Negi,"Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"We were a group of 8 people. Not only was this camping site comfortable and luxurious to stay at, but also an experience to remember....in other words 'A Must Stay' property. It is very appropriate for a group of friends with excellent service given by the staff there. The food starting from the morning tea and breakfast till the evening meal was very nice. The manager 'Sumant' who was very helpful took special care of our group and accompanied us while assisting with the beautiful forest trek early morning. Overall, it was a beautiful camping trip, experienced one of their most memorable trips.",SaffronLeafDehradun,/Profile/SaffronLeafDehradun,"Dehradun, India",50
