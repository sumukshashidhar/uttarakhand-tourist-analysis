tehri-gharwal,"  Saur village was this tiny place tucked away for soul wanderers. It's intimate and far away from the world. Mud cottages, green fields, mountains, a few faraway abandoned huts, temples and a tiny village at a distance, winding paths which take you into the being of the forest....it all adds to the mystique. Just the kind of place i wanted to be in. We travelled in a group, a Capoeira workshop, so it was perfect for us. The stay at the cottages was insanely refreshing. The humble home cooked food is something which left us wanting more.. Must mention the excellent service by the staff there. The bonfire, the starry experience... Simply, a beautiful stay. Can't wait to go back.    ",Poushali-Mullick,/Profile/Poushali-Mullick,"New Delhi, India",50

The night sky is nothing like you would have ever seen. The services is great, rooms and toilets are clean and the evening bonfire makes the entire experience complete. String your hammock, get your favorite book and get lost here or take a small trek in the surrounding area for a unadulterated experience.",nkhlsrf,/Profile/nkhlsrf,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
tehri-gharwal,"We were 2 families and stayed at DueNorth for 3 nights. The best part of this place is that is it extremely cut-off and there is simply no vehicular traffic. You are unlikely to hear more than 4-5 cars go by in a day or see anyone from outside the village. The road ends about a km or so after DueNorth and hence this place is so peaceful and quiet - absolutely no tourists at all. Not even the day-visit variety.   This restored property has 2 parts - the old house with a few rooms and 2-3 new rooms. We stayed in the new ones and that was a big mistake. The rooms are tiny, not small. And the washroom was almost falling apart. The sink was about to fall down, the cistern has hanging by a few hinges and the mirror was resting uneasily on a few screws.

tehri-gharwal,"Coupla hours away from D'dun and a sub 8 hour drive from Delhi, Saur Cottages turned out to be quite the hidden gem. We discovered some amazing trails dotted with a rivulet, ate some incredible fresh food cooked (by their staff) with veggies freshly plucked from their very own garden, and absolutely adored the peace and tranquility- which was conducive to some great conversation.     Great cottages- after all the hikes and the food, we slept like babies- only to be woken up to freshly cooked eggs! Staff was fantastic- they displayed the highest standards of hospitality! All in all, a great eco-tourism retreat.",Sambuddha B,/Profile/sambuddhab2014,,50
tehri-gharwal,"Stay in a restored pahari (traditional mountain-style) home high in the mountains of Tehri, surrounded by terraced fields, small streams, and views of pine-covered mountains. Around 3 hours drive from Dehradun, Saur is a village - it's gorgeous, but remote and rustic in the truest sense of the words. Go here if you love being in the midst of nature, but don't go here if you need the trappings of city life to enjoy your vacation. You'll stay in a traditional mud and wood structure that is comfortable, clean, and charming, but by no means is it ""lavish"". Food is wholesome, simple and oh so good - Indian curries, rice, roti and dal is what you'll get. There is no wifi and no tv. When it rains (and it pours), there may be long power cuts. But that's where the charm lies - to watch",Malavika B,/Profile/MalavikaB7,,40
tehri-gharwal,"An amazing place with a view to match. You can go for treks or just sit around in the sun reading with no one around to bother you. Was amazed to see so many different species of birds, if you're lucky you can spot an animal bounding up a hill side oh and the goats are very friendly!  The food was simple and tasty, there are no shops in the village so carry everything you think you'd need. Would definitely recommend the place to people who want to get away from the city and go somewhere without tourists or any sort of commercialization. Also getting there is pretty easy from Delhi.",Varun,/Profile/ShamanGalactic,,40

One can just unwind..be it the early morning trekking around the cottage or having a stroll in the nearby fields. The chirping sounds of variety of birds early in the morning and an air of calmness gives you a heavenly feeling. Friendly staff to take care of all your needs and offering sumptuous food.

I spotted atleast 15 different bird species from the window of my cottage alone. Other then that, its a great place if you just want to chill and do nothing. Much much better then overcrowded hill stations of India. Its not a hill station, its a experience . You wont find herd of tourist flocking this place, ugly structures being erected every where.

You have to drive down approximately 11km from the main highway to reach there. After parking your vehicle you have to walk downhill for about 100m to reach the guest house. I would highly recommend this place for a do-nothing break, there is no one to disturb you. Just pack your bag, take a couple of books and enjoy the sun light or evening bon-fire.

When we entered this pace , it give a very pleasant feeling. No cars to push horns, no people to talk .. you can hear birds chirping, cows mooing and the sound of wind. That's it..  I always used to think while crossing such valley roads, that how is the life of the people who stay in small huts. Staying in Saur cottage answered all my questions.

Home Stay 2. Eco Village Tourism Have been looking for a place & property which doesn't fall into the usual 'touristy' tag. Where you are not over bothered by other obnoxious guests. Where other guests share the same kind of interest, perhaps. My one of the very good friend suggested this place. Had a chat with Meghann, the estate manager and paid advance for 1 night in way back in Mar'15. Something or the other turned up and we couldn't visit till I decided that it was just enough.

While walking-strolling not a single car or vehicle crossed us and the kids  had a great time running around and enjoying themselves on the hill side.  The cottages themselves are cute and very well kept with good quality and clean sheets and bedding.    The main person there, Meghann guided us from the very beginning and was very friendly throughout the stay.  The service is extremely nice and the people are very courteous.  In the beginning we were a bit taken aback by the rustic setting as were were expecting a semi-resort like setting, but we had an overall great stay and experience.

The site is quite isolated and makes for a refreshing change from the hustle and bustle of Delhi (the evenings were marked by near-complete silence outside). The meals were all well-prepared and satisfying, especially the egg rolls at breakfast and the packed lunch of paratha, dahi, achaar, and subzi we took on one of our hikes. The accommodations were simple but functional and more than adequate for our needs, given we were looking mainly for fresh air and solitude.

In a valley that is quite remote and therefore you will experience peace and quiet like you can in few other places. A little off the beaten path so helps to have your own car or to have a taxi arranged.  Amenities: The buildings are old but refurbished to give it a modern touch. Comfortable but not luxurious. And luxury isn't why you are heading to DueNorth anyway.  Service: We were there on a weekend when we were the only 4 at the place. The service was courteous, friendly, and prompt. Were offered a refreshing drink on arrival. The cook was very proactive in asking us about our meal preferences and timings. Food was also good.

That Due North does justice to this by providing us with an uncorrupted and unique view into the life and times of a village nestled in the HImalayas is what made my experience unique and unforgettable.
