tehri-gharwal,"First things first...It is not a regular hotel or resort. It doesn't have room service or minibar in the rooms. Good thing is, it is prominently mentioned in the website at the time of booking.  Frankly that's a good thing as you can saunter down to the dining hall through the well manicured garden & spend some time at the museum on the floor above. The positive vibes as soon as you enter are very welcoming. We were a family of 4 traveling with our pet.  We booked into the forest hut but on arriving we found it a tad congested. Mr. Arif, who was supervising, immediately upgraded us to the super deluxe suites located on the first floor which were delightfully decorated. We stayed in Nanda devi & Sagar mantha which have a nice balcony overlooking the gardens & adjoining forest. ",Santosh Nair,/Profile/370santoshn,"New Delhi, India",50

tehri-gharwal,"Nice,  quaint place at Rishikesh...its owned by Col Bull Kumar,  an ex army man... A great man! U can read all about him on the net.   The rooms r nice and well kept.  The food is tasty... A-la-carte can be ordered.. The best part about the place is the kuchcha road that goes down to the Ganges... In the summer,  u can bathe in the cold water... Theres a lovely collection of books too. The resort also offers adventure activities like rafting, at a price.   The best part is the place is right on the highway,  but not noisy... This could b a good place to break ur journey while on an expedition.  ",BN Karthik,/Profile/131karthikk,"Mumbai, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"I stayed with my wife in Bull's Retreat in Dec 2019. I had a few apprehensions at first when my wife booked it but the hospitality of the staff proved me wrong.  The property is beautifully planned and decked up thoughtfully. It is a totally eco friendly resort with a very positive feel.   Their lead staff Aarif is a one man army. From serving food to room service, he was on his toes for everything. My wife and I were the only two guests in the resort at that time but Aarif made sure we do not feel it in any way.  A must visit for everyone who plans to stay in a peaceful place like Shivpuri. ",Ankit B,/Profile/ankit260185,"New Delhi, India",40

Very nice sit outs in the well kept lawns. The staff was very hospitable with a very positive and helpful attitude. The food variety was amazing and extremely well prepared. Had to go for long walks after the meals.  Enjoyed the small library. My dog loves the place due to the open area and good walk areas in the vicinity. There was a little noise and disturbance due to widening of the main highway but that is temporary and will make this place faster to reach.

tehri-gharwal,Bulls Retreat was highly recommended through various sites and since we were in the area we went looking for it. To start with the pictures make it look gorgeous and it really wasn't so. The place is small and wasn't as happening as the pictures show. The room was small and very very dimly lit with horrible sheets and quilts etc. Very very basic. The play area outside looked ok but the place looked dead. Maybe the season is not on or I don't know what. But was very very surprised and we just saw the property and walked out.

tehri-gharwal,"We stayed at this resort as a family of four, and had two rooms with them. In terms of size, its not a very big resort / homestay and probably has 4 or 5 rooms in all. The best part about the Bull's retreat is that it is located in the midst of beautiful trees and they have beautifully maintained gardens of their own. In the morning, their guide takes you for a morning walk in the mountains (if you fancy that), and treats you to a refreshing tea in the middle of the walk at a nice view point. About 5-10 minutes from this resort, you can reach the river side (Ganges) using a small kuchha lane that goes from within the resort itself.

Need to just suggest a few things which will make the property still better:  1.

The rooms are clean but not exactly like the one what you expect for 5K.  Now, the good things, and there are many. One has to trek down for about 20 mins to go to the ganges. Winderful view. The hotel will always arrange for someone to escort. They had also arrange for tea and snacks without even asking for it. Great.  Food is really good. Tasty simple and lot many variations.

Things which appealed to me were that the Hotel mentions it has a private beach which is not really true [at-least doesn't fit into my definition] and it really disappointed me. The so called private beach is about 400-500 metre walk down hill through the forest and the path is rocky and you must wear shoes to walk through. Once you reach near the river, you realize that its a rocky area where you cannot really sit and just hop across rocks. You simply cannot take your family or people who cannot walk much on rocks along to river side from hotel. This simply spoiled my trip.

It was busy at the weekend but almost deserted in mid week.   Our first room as adjacent to the garden and had plenty of natural light, the second was towards the back and somewhat dark.  Both rooms were however well appointed, reasonably sized, clean and comfortable.  There was plentiful hot water, though there were occasional short power cuts (we learnt to keep our head torches handy!).  ",Louis L,/Profile/LouisL768,"Westbury, Wiltshire",50

tehri-gharwal,I stayed here for one night and one night at the MHE beach camp. I must say the rooms were very clean and had this homely feel to them. The staff was very helpful. Amruta from the front desk was really helpful and showed us around.  We stayed one night at the MHE beach camp which is a must do when ur in Rishikesh. But after rafting and bunjee when ur body starts aching the next morning.. It's always better to get up somewhere with more amenities than a camp :p,Mrinalini_Kulkarni,/Profile/Mrinalini_Kulkarni,,50

We hired a coach n had a fun-filled  8 hr journey (stopped a few times on the way). Reached the resort at 7am which is about a further 20 min drive aftr rishikesh and easy to locate! Even though we reached really early they checked us in and even accomodated an extra bed as we had booked 5 rooms for 11 prople. The room decor is really nice and unique with efficient a/c's for the summer. The resort is beautiful, quiet and makes you feel you're in middle of mother nature. We quickly headed towards the river which was a short 10 minute walk. There were some tent accomodations but we were glad we stayed in the resort as it became quite hot during the day.

tehri-gharwal,Our trip to Rishikesh was only for adventure.. I had heard of white water rafting and got to know abt Bull's retreat from trip advisor. Our booking procedure was smooth and we reached rishikesh. We had to drive for around 20 min to reach Bull's retreat after we crossed Rishikesh town.  we had taken a package for 2 days which included rafting and other adventure activities and also the food..  We reached bull's retreat at arnd 3 in the noon.. but still we were served nice lunch though we were late.

We were to be put up at the Mercury Himalayan Expedition campsite, however we got delayed and were told that its impossible to cross the river to reach the campsite after sunset. The news dismayed us, but the MHE guys willingly accommodated us at their hotel Bulls Retreat. They called ahead and when we reached home, we had our rooms set up plus piping hot dinner all ready for us. The hotel was great, rooms extremely clean and warm. Food was awesome. Amruta Raje, who was incharge of the hotel, took great care of us and even arranged the bonfire which was part of the camp deal.

Apart from rafting shivpuri is a nice weekend destination from delhi/ncr. Lot of kasauli lovers will love this place because of it's wilderness and ganges. The hotel has a kind of semi private beach which is at an altitude with Ganga flowing below. There is a 10 min walk route to the beach between the woods, a wonderful unexpected birding place. The hotel rooms are very very good and very clean with all facilities. Food is like home cooked tasty food with naturally grown hill vegetables. The staff is service oriented. All in all a very good hotel with nice arrangements. Not a place for summers but they have AC rooms.",wanderlust_birds,/Profile/wanderlust_birds,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,We visited the property in December 2013 with our two pets and were in for a very pleasant and surprising experience all the way though. It is a fantastic property away from the hustle and bustle of main Rishikesh. Rooms and amenities were fantastic as were the entire staff. Kudos to the entire team for a really memorable stay. The food was terrific and cooked to our desire. The lawns were immaculately manicured and the bonfire was more than welcome. Will definately recommend this property with my eyes shut.  All in all - nothing to complain or frown about.   To the entire team that looked after our every need - take a bow. Will return for sure.

Prashant, a friend suggested the MHE - as they were known for their safety standards.  Kushal, Akshay (& Salil) were very patient and resourceful in helping us plan our vacation.   They even gave us inputs on other places to visit/stay at on this trip, after listening to what sort of experiences we wanted. They made the necessary arrangements for us, too!   We enjoyed our drive from Delhi to Rishikesh...  When we reached Aaranyya, we were greeted by Shailender & the staff of Aaranyya...

It was not at all difficult to make our choice for it, and we halted fr the night.  The place is great with serene surroundings in the lap of nature with the Ganges flowing very near to the resort. There was big lawn in the front, hill on one side and Badrinarh highway on the other. The rooms were not very big size but decent enough. The main thing lacking was any view from the room windows. But u can sit on the lawn adjacent to rooms and relish the beauty of mother nature.  The eco-friendy concept of the hotel was quite appealing.
