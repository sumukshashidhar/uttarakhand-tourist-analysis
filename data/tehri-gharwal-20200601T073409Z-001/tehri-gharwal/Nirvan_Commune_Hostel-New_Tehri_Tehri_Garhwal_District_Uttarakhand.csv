tehri-gharwal,"Nirvan Commune is not only one of the most beautiful places I have ever been to, it is one of the most peaceful as well. Vikash, the manager, was so welcoming and took me to visit the local villages. Not to mention, he is an excellent chef. A trip to Nirvan Commune is a must. The views are unlike anything I have ever seen and the tranquility and serenity of the mountains is absolutely incredible. It is a perfect place to relax, hike, practice yoga etc. and an excellent place for self-reflection and meditation. The school that runs below the hostel is remarkable and the teacher is doing a fantastic job with her growing class. The beauty of Nirvan Commune is breath-taking and I highly recommend it.",d3clips3,/Profile/d3clips3,"Boston, Massachusetts",50
tehri-gharwal,"We heard about Nirvan Commune from a flyer at Little Buddha cafe in Rishikesh. We were able to meet up with the manager who was visiting Rishikesh as well to learn more. He gave us plenty of information and was very accommodating in our needs (we are traveling with a child so we had a lot of extra questions). We were informed that it should be only a 4 hour bus journey from rishikesh. One of the staff was able to travel with us to the guest house. After 7 hours ( not 4) on a cramped, squashed bus going through winding roads (some of the most beautiful scenery we've encountered seen) we arrived at the commune. (It's not a commune really, more a guest house). We were greeted with absolutely stunning views of the snow capped Himalayas. The rooms were clean, with a squat toilet,",rohandrob,/Profile/rohandrob,in a backpack,50
tehri-gharwal,"The drive from Rishikesh to this hostel is itself an adventure, just the amazing mountain villages along the way give you a great insight into indian life in these remote areas.. Arriving at Nirvan I was taken back by the views it has of the Himalaya foothills, as a photographer it was a dream come true.... The Hostel is a beautifully decorated, clean, comfortable place with great energy that will allow you to unwind from the hustle and bustle of India and just relax amongst nature. I took a short walk down the road to a little village where people are so friendly and welcoming that I went from guest to local over one cup of chai .. If you want to comfortably experience nature, or traditional Indian life in remote India, this Hostel is for you..",Martin S,/Profile/MartinS151,"Sydney, Australia",50
tehri-gharwal,"I wanted to get away fro the normal route of Rishekesh and Dharmsala so decided to make the journey to Nirvan.  Its in a tiny villiate on top of a mountain that has stunning views, on one side the Himalayas, on the other a big blue lake surrounded by mountains.  The place is newly opened so the villagers are still not used to seeing foreigners so they are very curious and friendly (We were invited to a local wedding ceremony)!.  The place itself has all you need, its clean, big, comfortable beds and lots of blankets (it gets cold at night so bring warm clothes) and has a nice big rooftop to catch some mountain sun.  The guesthouse and location both just give off a nice energy.",Chachie034,/Profile/Chachie034,"Barcelona, Spain",50
tehri-gharwal,"We had the chance to stay 2 weeks in this great hostel, in the calm and beauty of Uttarakhand mountains. So far away from agitation of cities, it was THE place to rest and have walks in a wonderfull nature. More, it permited us to know more easily local people, so far away from mass tourism, who are very welcoming and good hearted people. So, if you want a good meeting with nature and local people, run for it!",marjolaine g,/Profile/marjolaineg685,"Avignon, France",50
tehri-gharwal,The day i was visited pratap Nagar one of the great experience in my life in Rishikesh. The landscapes are still onmy dreams with its own chilling breeze.  I saw a real tribal indianvillage with good hearted people.The children from the village was very sweet to welcome all the guest and to give their heart warming smile which makes you and gives you a positive energy. Dont miss to visit nirvan commune during your rishikesh visit.,Sudheesh K,/Profile/sudheeshk,"Pondicherry, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"I stayed a week and everything was perfect, I really love it!!.The hostel is very quiet and cozy, with a amazing view. The food was very good and the room very comfortable.

Absolutely recommended!!!. I wanna go back!!!",Clara R,/Profile/438clarar,"Barcelona, Spain",50
