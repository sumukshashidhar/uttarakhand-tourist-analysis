tehri-gharwal,The Roseate Ganges is a must stay!! It blew me away and every little detail was considered. The service from staff was excellent and the food was outstanding and fresh and nothing like I had tried before. It was hard to leave to eat anywhere else!  If you want to be in the busy area of Rishikesh then this place isn‚Äôt for you. Otherwise there is a car service that will take you into Rishikesh and wait for a few hours then bring you back. It is quiet and still and a wonderful place to de stress right next to the Ganges. It is incredibly peaceful and can‚Äôt wait to go back.  The spa service was outstanding and unique - the traditional herb massage is definitely something you need to try. The therapist was so experienced and very professional.

Positives: - Great location & views - Fantastic food - Very friendly (and generally good) staff. We were especially happy with Shubham in the restaurant and Megha, our yoga instructor, who were both very friendly and professional and made us feel genuinely welcome   Needs to improve: - This property does not have an alcohol license. This is not disclosed anywhere. The hotel website says that the restaurant serves ""mocktails and non-alcoholic brews"", but this is not the same as being unable to serve alcohol.

They really made us happy with their small gestures, such as keeping water bottles in our car without us asking to preparing special drinks for us at dinner. Salman even packed some sandwiches for us for our drive back home.

tehri-gharwal,"AT the kind of cost per night one would expect the earth and the moon. Firstly they gave us rooms far apart. We were travelling with my sons and obviously wanted them closer to us but they said they didnt have any rooms. The we find seepage in the room, the phones don't work- which means you climb up the stairs and climb down to order or speak to anyone. Was hilarious cause the places is obviously built in a step fashion and not on plane ground. Then my son got locked into the bathroom and the door wouldn't open. Next we are told that to repair the phone they would need two hours minimum since it had rained the previous night- there had been some short circuits so things had gone spoilt. We thought we'd eat and handle on thing at a time. The food portions were small and the food",Sonali Mehra,/Profile/sonalim98,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",20
