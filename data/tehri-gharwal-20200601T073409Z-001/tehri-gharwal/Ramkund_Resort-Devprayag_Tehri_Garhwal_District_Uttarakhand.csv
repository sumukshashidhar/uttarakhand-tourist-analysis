So being a localite I saw the resort from outside many times and this time decided to give a stay with family just b'coz of its location. My since thanks to Mr ashutosh,vikas and rajender ji who helped me n my family in all they could. But other staff has all the ego that you could ever satisfy.there is a lot of roadside construction work for all weather road going on the way so my car was fully laiden with thick dust on Windows and windscreen till I reached the resort.as driving on hills with a poor visibility is dangerous and doesn't look good for a guest  to wash his car in parking in front of other guests and passerbys So I politely asked one of the worker for a couple of buckets on the windows( of course with an extra tip).",Snowy,/Profile/Dehraduntraveller,"Dehradun, India",10
tehri-gharwal,"This resort undoubtedly has the best location in Devprayag and could have gone far and done fantastic business if marketed properly. However, such a beautiful property has fallen victim to its own policy failing, it seems.  When I tried to book it online, it showed ""Sold Out"" on all sites. However, on calling them 1 hour before we arrived there, they said rooms are available. When we reached there we were the only guests in the resort and we would remain so for the whole night. An eerie experience, somewhat!  The property looks neat and clean from outside but inside its shabby and lacks maintenance. I had to go through three rooms before I could find one that was livable.

The room was cold, damp and none to clean! Our bed was strangely made up with bottom sheet on the mattress then a blanket with a quilt on top. The quilt and pillowcases was badly stained and when shown to a member of staff they did change the quilt which in fact was not much better!  There was NO hot water supply but we were told they would turn it on on the morning so we could shower. The room was so cold and damp we asked for a heater which was duly supplied but this proved to have no effect on warming the room up as it was so damp.
