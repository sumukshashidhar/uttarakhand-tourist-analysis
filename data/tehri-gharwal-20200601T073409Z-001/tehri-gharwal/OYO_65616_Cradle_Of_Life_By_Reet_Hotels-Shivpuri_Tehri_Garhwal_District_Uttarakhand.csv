Very comfortable accommodation in terms of neat clean tents and place. They provide all amenities and work hard to make the stay as comfortable. The staff is ever helpful. The food is like home. Special mention for Mr. Chandan Joshi for making this a wonderful place to stay. Tip for the first timers.. It is a camp so no network, no wi fi, no TV. It is that prefect digital, mental, physical detox zone. With Friends it was awesome, though with children along it could be a little off beat but they will enjoy the adventure and indoor games .",bhaskar,/Profile/BhaskarPad,,50
