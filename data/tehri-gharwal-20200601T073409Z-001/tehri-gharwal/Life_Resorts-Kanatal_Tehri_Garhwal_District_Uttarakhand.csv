tehri-gharwal,"We stayed here for 2 nights and the overall experience was just superb.  The things I liked about this property the most... 1. The owner - Extremely courteous person and adjusting as per your needs. 2. The service - The service was too good. It actually overpowered small negligible negatives of the property. 3. The food is good and prepared hygienically. After taking the order, they used to bring things from the shop and then prepare. 4. The view of the valley from here is extremely beautiful.  The only problem which people with knee problem or elderly people will face in reaching this place. One need to trek/walk down 100meter approx to reach this resort.   We were 3 females and 3 kids (4-5yrs), and were little sceptical whether to walk down with kids, should we stay here. But",Sarika T,/Profile/SarikaT48,,40
