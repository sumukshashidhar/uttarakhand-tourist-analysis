tehri-gharwal,"I had been to this place twice - in October 2011 and October 2012.  I, along with 4-5 of my colleagues, went there as  'teacher escorts' to a group of 50 children of class 6. In both of the occasions it was the annual educational excursion of the students of The Scindia School (Gwalior). The itinerary was the same in both the tours. Each one was of duration of 5 D/4 N, including the last day white water rafting at Rishikesh.   We enjoyed a lot in this camp. The adventure activities, evening walk through jungle woods, a 5 hour trekking, night-out and tent pitching, hike to Surkanda Devi temple, a picnic-lunch at Dhanoulti, visit to the Tehri Dam, boating in the river Bhagirathi, marketing in the main Chamba town, river rafting in the Ganga (at Rishikesh) - every part of the tour",ArghyaDas1985,/Profile/ArghyaDas1985,"Kolkata, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"A lovely location in an off beat place in the Uttarakhand hills. Well worth the price. The area and tents were well maintained. The staff was superb - attentive to every detail with a very positive and friendly attitude. My family (and our dog) was looked after very well. The variety of dishes made for every meal during our four day stay was astounding, besides being well prepared.",pankag,/Profile/pankag,"Faridabad, India",50
