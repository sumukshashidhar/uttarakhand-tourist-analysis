tehri-gharwal,"Cool place with ,good room and room service and the best is the Ganga view from the balcony.  Hotel also have direct access to the ganga ghat directly from the hotel. I enjoyed stay here and watching the ganga from the balcony.  Mangesh Bhosale",MNG1994,/Profile/MNG1994,,40
tehri-gharwal,"Good place to stay, especially on the bank of river ganga. I loved the place very much because of the location. You can use the gallery from the hotel to directly go to ghats of river Ganga. But rooms were very small. Rest all was fine. ",Aditya K,/Profile/412adityak,,40
tehri-gharwal,"The Hotel is located bang on the Ghats, near Ram Jhoola and Taxi stand. As far as convenience goes, it's very well located. However, it is quite badly maintained. Its located on the main Road and so there is a lot of dust and flies at the reception area. It kind of puts you off.  Then the plaster and paint on the walls are peeling off at many places. Even though our Ganga facing rooms were clean, the management did not care to change the sheets or pillow covers before we checked in. The sheets/pillows certainly looked and smelled 'slept in'.Although they promptly changed them when we complained, it felt quite unprofessional.  The Restaurant adjoining the Hotel looked more like a dhaba and the environs were not very clean. The staff was helpful and sweet, but all of them looked",sutscity,/Profile/sutscity,"New Delhi, India",30
