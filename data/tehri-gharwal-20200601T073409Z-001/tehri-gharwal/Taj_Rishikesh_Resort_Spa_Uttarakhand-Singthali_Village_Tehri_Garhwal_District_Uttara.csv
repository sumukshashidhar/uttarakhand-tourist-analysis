tehri-gharwal,"SaiRam  We stayed at Taj Rishikesh from 12th Mar to 20th Mar..  By Bhagwan Sri Sathya Sai Baba‚Äôs Grace, we have been to almost all Taj hotels in India, and we must say that Taj Rishikesh is by far the best due to the most important single aspect being - Serenity & Divinity of the location. The vibrations around due to Maa Ganga are completely divine.. All Taj resorts have best of locations, bt this can be called as the superb most one..  Resort itself is also done superbly well. The rooms, the views of Maa Ganga from rooms, the amenities like best of restaurants, the swimming pool, the gym, the Yoga area, the gardens, everything in fact everything is done so nicely.

tehri-gharwal,"We landed at Taj by accident.   Actually we were booked at Roseate Rishikesh. After checking in there, we found our junior suite to be suffocating so we ran away from there and landed up at Taj.   We wanted to stay for one night but due to a landslide we were held up and had to stay for an additional day.   To our utter surprise at check out when we were settling our bill we found that the hotel charged us 50% tariff for the second day. When we asked the hotel why they had done such a thing, Mr Mathur told us that since you were forced to stay additional night due to landslides, we decided that we should share the burden equally.

tehri-gharwal,Modern new hotel in foothills of Himalayas     Staff lovely but limited English which made food ordering difficult. Taj Hotels should ensure their staff can understand guests and train them accordingly   Food often cold due again to staff training  Muzak played rather than beautiful Indian music.   Lovely pool area but no water served although staff stood around and no drinks were available at the pool until 1 pm despite the heat even though there was a bar and restaurant and none could be ordered  from room service   We understand manager is Canadian. He should know better.   Pool staff left wet towels on chairs even though there were only a few chairs in use.

The restaurant is not elegant as one might expect from a luxury hotel, but rather it is a cafeteria style, family restaurant type of place. And it was indeed filled with families and lots of noisy kids. I opted to dine outside on the patio, hoping for more quiet, but there were kids running around and playing out there too.

The resort itself, the location, the food, and the amenities (such as the spa) were all exquisite.  However, I must say, what set's the Taj apart from other hotels of equal quality, is the hospitality. During your stay you will be treated like family, and you will begin to think of the Taj as a second home.   I'd particularly recommend taking the day trip to Devprayag, eating some of the local dishes at the restaurant, and spending some time at the Spa.

tehri-gharwal,It is a lovely property with high class service . The view from my corner Junior suite (room no 107) was really magnificent . We could see nearly a 360 degree view  of Ganges change direction from our room. The swimming pool location is very good  overlooking the Ganges .. The evening ganga pooja /arti  was very good. The pebble walk along Ganges was interesting . The food variety is very good with lot of local Himalayan cuisine . I feel it is the best resort and spa on the Indian hills . It also have potential to be one of the best in the world when the villas open shortly.. It is a place to go to and highly recommended . The most unfortunate part was that stayed for one night  and found it difficult to leave such a good place. Will be back shortly...,Sanjay Vohra,/Profile/Sanjay04111969,"Dehradun, India",50

tehri-gharwal,"Great location if you‚Äôre looking for complete disconnect, friendly staff, clean rooms in the lap of mountains and the mighty Ganges just few steps down from the property!  Love the brown n grey feel of the resort. It boasts of a library...a sit out...an infinity pool...sharing a horizon with the Ganges flowing down below. Evening loved the Aarti besides the Ganges...which is a flight below from the pool!  Can enjoy various adventure activities conducted by the hotel...but they come with a price tag! There is a pebble beach and white sand beach...if u want to explore d tracks!  The hotel is a recluse...away from the  humdrum...but the delectable food at the resort would want u to get into the eat-sleep-pool-repeat mode!

tehri-gharwal,"Being a hodophile , me and my husband experimented with this youngest  taj property for my Birthday.....though we were a bit skeptical to choose this hotel because we were told that  the hotel is still yet to open few more restaurants and the spa . But the  Taj hospitality was beyond believe . We stayed at the deluxe room with most beautiful views . We saw some villas which will be added to their room inventory soon.  We were received with a warm welcome by the GM Mr Balraj Singh .  The hotel is adjacent to river Ganges with a pebble beach attached . The whole area is calm ,serene and picturesque  The exceptional service from the staff was second to none .  A very special mention for Mr Aditya ( restaurant manager ) who was on foot right from breakfast to late night dinner",Priyanka4484,/Profile/Priyanka4484,"Kolkata, India",50

tehri-gharwal,"I thoroughly enjoyed peace and tranquility on the holy Ganga River. The amazing views and mountain air rejuvenated my spirits. The graceful, visionary Himalayan Mountain architecture is an authentic work of art, constructed of stone, iron, and wood blending into the colorful mountainside. The separate children‚Äôs pool and play area, as well as the authentic pizza restaurant, make this a wonderful family destination.  The innovative design of the spa is breathtaking. The diversified Taj cuisine in the three restaurants is superb and the exceptional service is world class. I will return‚Ä¶ and with my grandchildren.",Ginger Petty,/Profile/GingerPetty,,50

tehri-gharwal,"Great Resort surrounded by mountains all over & views of Ganges . This resort opened for visitors in last week of March 2019 & few renovations works still going on. Ambience is excellent with panoramic views over river & mountains. This is ideal place to relax with sounds of flowing river & chirping of birds. All rooms have balconies & majority of rooms face river. Service level is top -notch with special mention of Mr Akashdeep & Mr Vij. Staff is more than willing to complete requests of guests. Dining is excellent -ingredients are locally sourced. Overall highly recommended. Few points to be noted - Bar is still not open ( licence under process), Jiva Spa is not fully ready ( for massage they have made alternate arrangements), this resort is around 60 minutes road journey from",RANJU30,/Profile/RANJU30,"New Delhi, India",50
