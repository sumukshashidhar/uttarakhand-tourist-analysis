The track was icy and it was cold in the cottage but it was truly magical . The image of the Himalayas  is firmly etched on my memory.  If you want luxurious facilities don’t come but if you want to experience the view of the majestic mountains in the different lights and enjoy local home cooked food and experience life like a local  then you’re in for a treat.

I will apprehensively admit that all my expectations be it solitude or be it the organic and natural ecosystem around the property everything was fulfilled. Also there's a volunteers from Tata School of Social Science who helped us with some new vegan yoga tricks and skills. I had never done Yoga with such breathtaking views and perfection.

Having visited a number of ""farm stay"" concept properties, I must say that the experience here was more than what I expected. When I reached the property, I was warmly greeted by Mr. Pradeep who is the caretaker and conversations with him were so insightful on Uttarakhand's culture and lifestyle. While we indulged in a number of farm activities, we met Mr. Dlip, who is the farms caretaker and we indeed took back great knowledge on the various farming practices and methods, which could also be handy for the little gardens of our city homes.

No digital made all co-holidayers interact and enjoy together, despite of not knowing each other from past we all bonded well with bon-fire, singing, playing and eating together.

This experience was unique because The Goat Village takes 'Eco Tourism' very seriously and the learnings stay with you, long after you come back to the chaos of the cities.  Staff is friendly and they leave no stone un-turned to make you feel at home. Views from the cottages are amazing. Food is all organic, and tastes like heaven.

We were told to play the judge of their hospitality and pay the money for the value we were offered (a very smart way of arriving on to a price point). I have travelled solo before as well but this was a first trip in the hills so I was a bit skeptical. But little did I know that we’d be in for a surprise.

Green People’s approach of having no roads to their sites for having less carbon footprint and provide employment to the local guides and porters in applaud worthy. What we saw in Kanatal was also completely different from that in their sites in Nag Tibba and Dayara Bugyal.

Its a good place for birdwatchers for sure. It was a very short visit of one night and the staff took good care. The food served was homely and tasty as expected if cooked by a villager. The room was neat and clean and gave a feeling of being in a resort than a Shepard's Home which was quite dissappointing for me personally as as I was expecting to stay in a stone house of a villager and have a lot of interaction which didnt happen.

The resort markets itself entirely on the basis of Eco Tourism, with a stated agenda “to bring significant environmental, conservation, social and economic benefits to all sectors of the society.” Their strap line painted on their signs and logo is “We don’t use plastic and we are fantastic”.
