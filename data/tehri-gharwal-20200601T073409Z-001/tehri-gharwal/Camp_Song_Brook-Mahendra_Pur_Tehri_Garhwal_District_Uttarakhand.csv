tehri-gharwal,"Awesome location totally in the wilderness spread over 150 bigas. River Song is barely 5 minutes walk from the resort and sitting on the rocks with your feet in the fast flowing river is like a natural foot spa. There is however a lot of scope for improvement when it comes to hygiene & cleanliness and if you are finicky then would suggest carrying your own sheets, pillows & towels.",citylinkers,/Profile/citylinkers,"New Delhi, India",30

tehri-gharwal,"This was a recce trip for a get-together being planned by us friends for the families etc. The trip was positive. The camp is owned and run by a Veteran Armed Forces Officer and his son.   Fabulous place it is a get away from the humbug of city life and gives one everything to connect with nature. Located in an area of 20 acres the camp provides 3 stars facilities. There is a natural pool kept filled with fresh water from River Song close by. For nature lovers there are close to 200 varieties of birds which could be spotted here along with some wild life like the barking deer, our ancestors (the monkeys) etc.   The retired Col nearly 88 years old was a pleasure to interact with and to update one's history and general knowledge. The staff very amiable, courteous and helpful.  Had",AMULKAPOOR,/Profile/AMULKAPOOR,"Dehradun, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"Camp Song Brook was a pleasant surprise. My point of reference, when I was told about CSB was the make shift camp at Rishikesh , I was prepared for 'roughing it'. The biggest plus for me was being so close to nature, I could see the clear skies & hear birds chirp. The warm welcome extended by everyone at the camp and the food was an added bonus. Haven't felt this close to nature or this relaxed in the longest time. Thanks to everyone who made this a truly special experience.",DabralSubodh,/Profile/DabralSubodh,,50
tehri-gharwal,"How to get there-   This place is located on an off-beat path on Maldevta Road, Raipur (even Google Maps does not show it), so watch out for the sign boards (pretty small) en route and keep in touch with the hotel staff on phone. The camp is tucked away on the banks of a river. It is an ideal place to spend quality time with family/ friends, the more the merrier! One can opt for a half day stay or an overnight stay in the tents.  Activities-   They have a wide range of activities viz. Burma bridge, Flying fox, any number of outdoor games, etc. To top it all, the gushing river nearby is an excellent place to wallow in. It is also very safe for small children due to shallow depth.  Accommodation/Service-   The tents offer basic amenities and have common toilets, which are clean",kunal b,/Profile/348kunalb,,40
tehri-gharwal,"I have taken a group of kids for a leadership camp to Camp Song Brook from October 23-25, 2015.  We were 20 people including kids and our team. We reached camp at 7 a.m. in the morning and we were told that we have to walk for 15 minutes.  After whole night of travel, it was not a welcoming gesture. Anyway we all walking down, but every step we took, feeling was mesmerizing. A small stream flowing next to the pathway and we were entering into deep jungle every minute.  As we reached the camp nobody could believe their eyes with such a vast place and location. Kids were greeted with Bournvita and adults with hot tea.  Staff was all the way smiling.  We did all kinds of adventure activities in the"" Natural Pool "" they call it. What a water body it was, much better than any Pool.",ParveenKdm,/Profile/ParveenKdm,"New Delhi, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"It was April last year when we decided to go to a unknown place for a quick holiday...... With a reference of one of our friend we decided to go to this place as pictures looks good.  We were surprise to see that we reached the camp within 30 minutes and we were not that excited on this short journey. As we started to move down on that ""Kaacha"" road which had a small river flowing next to it... we started feeling the smell of nature in the air.... After a bumpy drive of 10 minutes our XUV reached in a open ground with pitched tent on one side and a amphitheatre on other....  It was mesmerising.  We were were given a very warm welcome by the staff there.  Though it was mid April but weather was beautiful. There was a huge pool behind the tents which had fresh water diverted from",Priyaanchal,/Profile/Priyaanchal,"Mumbai (Bombay), India",50
tehri-gharwal,"We visited this place for 25th Anniversary for our brother-in-law on recommendation of one of our friend.  The initial walk itself was a beautiful experience in itself and once we reach camp , it was like reaching in heaven.  Wide area, many tents, clean bathrooms, unique bathing areas and on the above a natural swimming pool. We were still enjoying this place as somebody asked us to walk towards the river... As we walked few meters from the camp we see a beautiful river song flowing next to the camp.... It was mesmerising... In all and all a best place for family holiday.....",TMdeepak,/Profile/TMdeepak,"New Delhi, India",50
