tehri-gharwal,"Location of this place is great as it is a little away from the hustle and bustle of the town. The property consists of 5 villas with a nicely maintained lawn and garden. The rooms are clean with all the basic amenities in place. The restaurant serves a variety of cuisines (including Israeli, Turkish and Italian) and overall food quality is decent. Staff is very courteous and helpful.  The check in process took a while as the room was not ready and the previous guest did not check out.",Souva,/Profile/Souva,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"I really enjoyed my stay here at Green Land Swiss cottages. The owner Gokul was really nice and welcoming. He gave me the cottage with the best view of the mountains and was always there when I needed anything. The room I stayed in was nice and comfortable. I felt like home. There is a small garden in front and I simply loved my morning and evening walks there, with a slight drizzle. The place is really peaceful and amazing. It has some awesome restaurants right in front too! Moreover, like other places, they could have made use of the space and built rooms attached to each other with no feeling of privacy. However, they chose to build individual cottages which gives you a feeling of home when you stay in. I simply loved the place and I would recommend it to everyone who visits",Pritisha K,/Profile/TheGoneGirl,Bangalore,50
tehri-gharwal,This was my second visit to this place. Like last time found it to be the nice place it was the last time. Basic cottage available at decent price. Definitely recommend for budget travellers. Has a lot of restaurants around the cottages where one can easily eat. Away from the hustle nd bustle of Rishikesh. A very good option with choice of world cuisines in the nearby restaurants. Yoga sessions held nearby and all basic requirements such as convenience store very close by. Free Wi-Fi available. Definitely recommend it for budget travellers!!!,Siddharth R,/Profile/863siddharthr,"Mumbai, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"I got recommended the place by a friend but as  I was traveling on a low budget, I called Gokul (the owner) and asked for a cheaper accommodation ( the cottages are around 1500-2000 per night, very worth!). There's a guest house managed by himself right next to the cottages and he arranged a room for me on phone. Gokul is very helpful and takes care of everything. As I arrived early in the morning and the room wasn't ready yet, I went in the town and he arranged my backpack in the room and got it ready for me.  The place has a restaurant with a very nice garden and there's a yoga class every morning.  It's is Tapovan in the Swiss cottage area which I personally enjoyed because it's out of the mainstream backpacking area and very quiet, out of the hustle and bustle of the noisy",Elisa D,/Profile/elisad131,"Monopoli, Italy",40
tehri-gharwal,"Green land cottage was a blessing in disguise for us as I had never heard about it before. It is an awesome place at the tapovan bypass.There are 5 cottages in total. The rooms are clean ,beautiful and very comfortable. The lawn in front is awesome.. The morning view is completely breathtaking.We couldn't stop taking pictures all over this place  There is swiss garden restaurant just in front offering mouth watering food. The place is completely calm and away from crowd.Don't forget to order the tandoori chicken and the chicken mushroon Lasagne once you are in the swiss garden restaurant. Also, there are bakeries around which offer good food  If one wants to stay at a place away from crowd , relax in silence...this is the place for you",arti y,/Profile/artiy2015,,50
