tehri-gharwal,"Hi Buddy,  We thought to utilise long weekend of Republic Day - 2016 by visiting nearby places around Delhi having snowfall and Ahlas our hunt ends in Kanatal ( Near Dhanulti ).  I was traveling in my Wagon - R from Delhi to Meerut to Muzzafarnagar to Roorkee to Dehradun to Dhanulti to Kanatal.  Its a 340 Km Journey with excellent road condition ( thanks to Khumb Mela in Haridwar)..leaving a small patch of 30 Km which is under construction between Purkaji and Roorkee...rest its awesome.  Thanks to "" El-Nino"" condition no such wild winter in hills and so the Snowfall but yes between Dhanulti & Kanatal you'll find Snowfall in patches with excellent view and less crowded place.",Zubair K,/Profile/143zukh,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"Possibly the best located campsite in Kanatal. Living Kanatal si the only camp that faces the Greater Himalayas side. Grab A chair, And sit and enjoy view of 6000 and some 7000 m plus peaks. BandarPoonchh and Trishul are visible from hhere on a clear day.  Yamunotri peaks are towards the extreme left, followed by Gangotri Glacier Peaks and then Kedarnath peaks in the right.   Food is excellent; the guys there would cook on your demand. There is also a Jungle trail right next to the camp, so Do try.   The camp is a little difficult to locate. So Do your research beforehand. !!   Happy Travelling !!",VisheshWanderer,/Profile/VisheshWanderer,"Faridabad, India",50
