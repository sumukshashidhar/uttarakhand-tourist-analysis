tehri-gharwal,Decent accomodation Clean kitchen Above average food Below average dining area ( gets really hot in June)  But the highlight is the location - nested in unspoilt nature in valley and far from the maddening crowd.,Pranav Shah,/Profile/Jaintourist,"Ahmedabad, India",30
tehri-gharwal,We were a group of 10 inc 2 kids.stayed on well maintained tents .Newly made property among scenic beautiful mountains.u can also trek down to a rivulet. We did rafting and zipline thru them which was a great experience.food was simple but nice. It rained in the evening but despite of that we had a bonfire where we sang and enjoyed.,Angelica,/Profile/Manishangie,,40
