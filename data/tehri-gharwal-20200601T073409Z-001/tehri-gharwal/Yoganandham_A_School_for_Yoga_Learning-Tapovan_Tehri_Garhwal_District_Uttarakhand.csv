tehri-gharwal,"I spent a month in this yoga school. Located in a beautiful valley surrender with mountains and paddy fields. Classes were good for Hatha yoga, Philosophy, anatomy etc.. Astanga yoga teacher Kamal was very good. Everyone liked his classes. Anatomy and meditation classes were helpful as well.   Facilities:  I got single room with attached bath room which was spacious enough. The kitchen was clean and food was good. Separate yoga room. Teachers were knowledgeable.  Feedbacks to Improve: No hot water facility for sometime and indeed after informing heater was not fixed. Better to have access to drink hot water in the morning before starting yoga sessions.(Kitchen was mostly locked before 7).",Sanchaari,/Profile/sanchaarit,,40
tehri-gharwal,"Had the best possible experience in Yoganandham for a 1-week retreat.  Too short unfortunately, but I'll surely come back.  Very good teachers, clear and helpful in their corrections and explanations, different types of yoga classes, highly interesting philosophy and meditation classes.  Food and rooms were great as well, and all staff nice and friendly!  Highly suggested! Have",Pierre93,/Profile/Pr3993,,50
