tehri-gharwal,"Visited on 23rd Dec 2018. We were group of 5 on our own vehicle. The parking was easy probably since it was December. The parking was 300 meters away from the camp. We paid, Rs. 1900/- per person. (this is too high)  Good:  1. Location: On the road good parking area and then 300 m walk to camp. 2. View: view of the valley was awesome. Tall deodara trees on the other side. 3. Cozy: Provided extra quilt, that made the sleep easy. 4. Tents: Over all good and clean.  Bad:  1. Food: Taste is below average. They were serving the food (quality, taste, look) not worth of Rs 50 for each meal. 2. Only three people where there in the whole camp as a staff. 3. Hot water is provide on request by bucket in the tent for bath. 4. Very small bulb in the tent and nothing else for lightening. Same",AbhayTheTraveller,/Profile/AbhayTheTraveller,Delhi,20
tehri-gharwal,"I have visited this camp in April-18, the views were extremely amazing with wind blowing us away with a beautiful mountain views. best for sunset and sunrise.Its very cold at night even in the summer. Food quality was awesome as well as hospitality. but there is one drawback in this camp as there very few activities as compared to other camps. Rest we enjoyed there a lot.",abhisheksinghamo,/Profile/abhisheksinghamo,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"We went on 26th January weekend. Best location i have ever seen. Wildex is located inside the forest ( 300 m walk from main road ). Staff was really very good. Food was very nice. Many fun activities. Snow all around. They have all the basic things, since its a camping site one has to compromise on luxury . A must visit place.",Vikas G,/Profile/VikasG800,,40
tehri-gharwal,"We went for camping and celebrating new year to this place. The location of the camp is one of the best you could get in entire kanatal/ Dhanaulti. But the maintenance of the camp is extremely poor. Almost all the tents are torn/ have many holes/slits and be assured that monkeys will enter in your camps and would search all your bags and will rob your eatables. The staff is very helpful and serve very good food. Keep in mind that some drunk boys group might ruin your peaceful stay here, as it happened with us.",1HungryGhost,/Profile/1HungryGhost,"Noida, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"They have a great ambience. Tents for accommodation and good food. There is arrangement of playing various games, treking or you can explore the place by yourself. Also they have bonfire sometimes and music arrangements if you are interested. But there is no parking arrangement.  But it is really awesome if you are an adventurous person.",Ashlesha G,/Profile/ashleshag2016,,40
tehri-gharwal,"Adventure is something that I have been always up to. Being a tourism student I have traveled length and breadth of the country. I have been in Delhi since the last 5 years now and have been going to different places as part of business trips. In a corporate trip of Fiinovation, 70 people visited Kanatal.   We contacted camp wildex who visited our office and explained the tour itinerary to us. We liked the things that they were offering to us. We wanted a camp which is secluded but has different activities to spend time. Although the food served to us was not that good, but when you are camping it is not something that you expect.   The only thing which was a issue there was ""Monkeys""... The place had so many monkeys that for many of us it was actually staying in the wild. The",Rahul C,/Profile/RahulC1359,"New Delhi, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"If you are looking forward for a adventurous corporate trip Camp Wildex – Kanatal is the perfect place. Situated at 8,400 fts near Dhanaulti, surrounded by dense pine, long wooded slopes of Deodar, Pine, Oak and Rhododendron forests, Kanatal offers picturesque view of Surkunda Devi Temple and Chaukhamba and Swargrohini mountain peaks. As a employee engagement programme of Fiinovation, different teams enjoyed the adventure activities such as rock climbing and valley crossing which were icing on the cake. The camp had a big enough dining area where they served us some tasty snacks and dinner. At night there were arrangements like DJ and bonfire. The property was well maintained and neat and clean tents were offered for the stay.  Camp Wildex is such a place that we would",anand k,/Profile/anandk723,,40
tehri-gharwal,"Never ever try this camp. Pathetic people, horrible service. I would strictly recommend to everyone not to travel to this destination ever. The owners are very unfriendly, very unprofessional people.  Very poor hospitality. The water was never available and when available, it was too muddy. The food was sad and the service was too slow. The quality of the food was pathetic. They were serving rice which I believe was not more than 20rs kg. The quality of vegetables were low too. They are making a fool out of people in the name of adventure activities. Rock climbing is on a piece of stone 20meters high and valley crossing is in the jungle between 2 trees.",YoungEdsplorer,/Profile/YoungEdsplorer,"New Delhi, India",10
tehri-gharwal,"It’s just by chance that I came across this place online, and I’m so glad I did. This is a hidden treasure amongst Kaudia forests. The campsite is very well located amongst the pines, at a great height with a picturesque view of Surkunda devi temple and chaukhamba and swargrohini mountain peaks. I went there with a bunch of friends and the moment we stepped out of our cars and made way to the campsite through the forest area we got such a rush. The property seems to be well maintained with comfortable and clean tents. They have a big enough dining area where they served us some tasty snacks and dinner. There were arrangements like DJ and bonfire as well  The next day we all went for some adventure activities such as rock climbing and valley crossing which by the way were an",Shreyaa19,/Profile/Shreyaa19,"New Delhi, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"I visited Camp Kanatal from Wildex just recently. It was the worst experience I have ever had. I am a travel freak and I frequently travel to places for camping but was the worst experience till date.   I would strictly recommend to everyone not to travel to this destination ever.   Let me start with giving some details: 1. No hospitality. I was waiting for the rooms to be allotted to me for 2 hours and there was no one to listen to me or provide me an update. 2. The water was never available for the 2 days I stayed there and when available, it was too muddy. 3. The food was pathetic and the service was too slow. The quality of the food was pathetic. They were serving rice which I believe was not more than 20rs kg when they are taking 2500 per night (too high than most of the",Ankit_agg,/Profile/Ankit_agg,"Ilford, United Kingdom",10
