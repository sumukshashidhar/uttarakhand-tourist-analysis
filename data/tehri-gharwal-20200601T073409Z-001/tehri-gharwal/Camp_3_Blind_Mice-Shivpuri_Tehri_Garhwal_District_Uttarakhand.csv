tehri-gharwal,"I visited here with my 3 friends in May. This camp shifted recently to the new location. You have to track for around 20-30 mins to reach the camp. Initially, we had a hard to find the camp because we didn't get proper guidance and won't find nearby landmkar or direction boards. However, this is a jungle camp which means it is surrounded by nature's beauty and trees. You can track to the near by river which is just 10 mins track. You can have a bath in the river. Camp is safe. you can enjoy cricket and volleyball and in night there is a bone fire and music which can be enjoyed too. You are limited to budget, you can try this camp.",naveen_oberoi,/Profile/naveen_oberoi,"New Delhi, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"This was more a funny experience for us since we decided to book a hotel in RIshikesh at around 8 pm at night on a long weekend when almost everybody from Delhi (and half of Mumbai) was there. We were told this was the last and the only option available to us. Having no choice of course, we went ahead with this camp. This camp site is approximately 30kms from the main market of Rishikesh (towards and ahead of Shiv Puri). BY the time we reached the site where we were to leave our cars and start the trek, it was already about 11 pm. It being my first time in Rishikesh, I had no clue how camp sites are located here etc. We picked our stuff and started to trek down the hill to reach our campsite. It being completely dark (of course), we trekked down for almost 20 mins. with our",mahima_captaintravel,/Profile/mahima_captaintravel,"Mumbai, India",40
tehri-gharwal,It is not a very good place as they have just shifted.. staff were good and meal also hygenic ..but washroom were filthy.. average place to stay. they must shift their tents to some neat and clean place.,bindu2016,/Profile/bindu2016,"New Delhi, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"I wish i could rate it in negative. Me and one of my friends planned a camping trip along with 26km rafting and bungee. We got in touch with this fellow who initially was over courteous and once the payment was done, he literally said to us that for them ""business is king and not customers"". The itinerary shared with us wasn't followed a bit and the office staff was extremely rude and laid back. The campsite wasn't a great delight as well. The rafting experience made up for all the troubles we had with this particular agency. An agency who believes Business is king and not customers is clearly an experience best avoided at all costs.",Manisha U,/Profile/ManishaU16,,10
tehri-gharwal,"Where do I start from. I booked this camp and headed to this camp with 8 other friends. In all we had made 5 bookings foe 10 people but last min a friend backed out. On my way, as a courtesy, I called the owner up to let him know we are coming.To my surprise I said he didn't have 5 tents and we would have to fit 3 in one. Also he didn't have any tents in Camp 3 Blind Mice and we will have to go another camp owned by him called Ganga Paradise. After this initial hick up we reached Ganga Paradise where after puttting our foot down we were given 5 tents. But it was a circus there. These people are clearly overbooked. And the solution the manager had to offer was Fit 4 in one tent or take your money back. Like seriously? After driving all the way from Delhi, Chandigarh etc. You",Advsethi,/Profile/Advsethi,"New Delhi, India",10
tehri-gharwal,It was an excellent and most memorable trip by far. Food quality and basic amenities are outstanding there along with the friendly staff. They were always there to assist in the best way at every step. They arranged bonfire with light music at Night which was superb. These guys guided me and my friends all about rafting and took proper safety measures.  Camp 3 blind mice gave me awesome memories.Wish to visit soon again.,Aastha J,/Profile/Aastha1110,"Navi Mumbai, India",50
