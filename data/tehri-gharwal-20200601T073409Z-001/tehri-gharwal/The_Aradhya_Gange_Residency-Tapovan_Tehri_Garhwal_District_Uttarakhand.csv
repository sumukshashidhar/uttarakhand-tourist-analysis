tehri-gharwal,"I received unwanted and unwarranted spam in messenger from this hotel today. I complained to them and they ignored my complaint. Very amateur, who harasses strangers via Facebook messenger to try to force them to book accommodation. This has to be the most desperate form of advertising Iv ever witnessed. Would never stay there purely because they stoop to such low tactics.",Margor_j,/Profile/Margor_j,"Dehradun, India",10
