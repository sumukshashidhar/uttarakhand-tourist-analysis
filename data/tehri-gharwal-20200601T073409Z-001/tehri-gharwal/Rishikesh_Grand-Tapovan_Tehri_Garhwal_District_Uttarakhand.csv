tehri-gharwal,"Me and my family visited Rishikesh Grand(Tapovan) last last week. After checking photographs and review I thought this hotel must be great but I was wrong. No doubt hotel is new so rooms and garden and swimming pool look good but the services.. oh my God it was horrible.. No bathroom accessories,no hot water. towels are used and dirty, so unhygienic. & If you call on reception they block your phone. If you go to them and ask anything they ignore you. How dare they. Customers are God for any business but they treat you extremely bad. If you order food they serve you too late and so bad food which you can't eat.. Everyday night they played so loud music and we couldn't sleep.  I am surprised how their reviews are so good but now come to know that they themselves write their",Anu Rao,/Profile/anurao1234,,10

tehri-gharwal,"Good points: The rooms including bathroom are of a decent size and very clean; there's a swimming pool; and a little patch for kids to run around.   The bad points: The location is a bit away from Laxman Jhula c. 700m and the shopping centre c.450m; and the service. I'm unsure how there are so many reviews saying the service is awesome. We stayed two nights with breakfast included. On the first morning it took 55 minutes for our breakfast to be served from us giving our order in the restaurant, this is the longest I have ever had to wait for breakfast in the many hotels across the world I have stayed in. At the evening meal they refused to serve dessert to my daughter because it was past 9pm. We asked for a cold drink and were advised to go and get ourselves from the shop down",Vijay_from_Surrey,/Profile/Vijay_from_Surrey,"London, United Kingdom",20
