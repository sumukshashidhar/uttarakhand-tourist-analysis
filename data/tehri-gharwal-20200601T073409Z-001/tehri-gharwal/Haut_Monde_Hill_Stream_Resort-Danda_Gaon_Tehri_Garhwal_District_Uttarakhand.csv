tehri-gharwal,What makes your stay memorable? 1. Whether the place and ambience is beautiful or not. 2. Whether the people or staff are professional and amiable or not. 3. Whether the services are top notch or not. 4. Whether you get desired amenities or not. 5. Whether you get something out of the box or not. You literally get everything here. It's like AMAZON in which you get everything from A to Z. Let me explain 1. Just a step inside this resort and you start getting the freshness in the ambience. Scenic view and mind boggling greenery will give you an overwhelming experience. This resort is huge and widely spread. 2. I would like to tell everybody the ownerÂ  Mr.BHASKAR BHRAMAR and his team will leave no stone unturned to make your stay wonderful. They are amiable and you get positive,nukulchhillar,/Profile/nukulchhillar,,50

tehri-gharwal,Our stay at Haut Monde Hill Stream Resort was great with a spectacular nature's view. The property is surrounded by hills with a valley down to the freshwater stream. The restaurant has delicious food with a wide range of delicacies. All the fresh produce that they use in the food comes from their organic gardens in the property. Rooms were excellent with a  great view. We received amazing hospitality from the staff there. I'll recommend this place to stay with family and friends.,Koka Pavan,/Profile/theonlykoka,,50

tehri-gharwal,"Our stay at Haut Monde Hill Stream Resort was just amazing, the view from the room towards the valley was just mesmerizing.  The rooms were really well maintained and the food was just fantastic. The sound of water stream passes by the resort is so mediating.

tehri-gharwal,"Hi Bhaskar,  It was a great trip, right from traveling to your place and entering the property till exiting. Then we came and saw the hospitality, welcome drink, the arrangements and the ambience.  I took advantage of every thing which includes, breakfast which was just mind blowing with the perfection and the variety that I never expected, dinner that has limited but perfected menu, the gravy, spices, oil, butter and the quality of everything was just outstanding.  Fading short of words to describe but it was too good to be there.   I took advantage of spa and they need some serious improvements, right from the infrastructure to therapy patterns. I find spa being overpriced with regards to the quality which was a turn down and similarly the Internet/ WiFi availability was not",Abash_u1,/Profile/Ankmishri,,50

tehri-gharwal,It was a night visit and initially I thought may be itâ€™s a mistake but when I reached in the evening found amazing. May not be a luxury Hotel but warmth and personal approach of staff is worth mentioning. I was asked what food I want for my dinner.. thatâ€™s excellent. Temp was 10 Deg and I had kebabs and Egg next to a sigri and loved the calmness. Saw two categories of rooms one on top and one at bottom. Loved both but stayed closed to nature   When you go donâ€™t expect Star luxury but completely expect fantastic hotel within a forest and stream. Recreation room and upcoming spa is a good add to the property. Trails and Zip line too in good weather. Solar used Hot water in bath and Clean room is what I liked.  Worth a visit if you want a quick quite relaxing break with nature.,AKHIL M,/Profile/343akhilm,"New Delhi, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"Awesome place. Awesome food. Quick and caring service. I enjoyed my stay over there with my friends, we had the best time of our lives.

Away from the city life this luxurious resort will help you to rejuvenate right in the lap of the nature. My room was spacious and had all the amenities and the best part was the view from the room.The staff was really helpful and friendly. We had plenty of options to choose from the menu and the food was appetizing. Also, the sunset point was mesmerizing. We clicked some great pictures. I would definitely recommend it.

tehri-gharwal,"Experience at Haute Monde was one of the best! Went with my office team for a two day getaway and gathered lifetime memories... The food was simply delicious in all three courses of meal, from the pahado wali masala maggi in breakfast to home cooked styled chicken in the dinner, it was a bliss to the taste buds. The adventurous activities arranged by them (river crossing, trekking, team building activity etc) and the service provided by the staff was really appreciable. The secluded property, away from the hustle lets you experience an ultra peaceful time. The rejuvenating location energised everyone!

tehri-gharwal,If you are looking for a off beat and quiet place you must visit this hotel which is located in a lovely place very close to Dehra Dun. Well connected with the roads. Food is very good.

tehri-gharwal,I booked this place in May 2019 for 9 couples. The booking was confirmed andadvance payment was also given for 8th june to 11th june. We reached the resort on 8th afternoon and we were informed that only 3 AC rooms were available and we have to take 6 Non AC rooms...Later it came to our knowledge that our rooms were alloted to some other group as they have paid higher price for our rooms...No intimation was given we were left in the open to look for other options...please please please...Dont visit this place..Total waste of money...no cleanliness..room are in a very bad position.,Vaibhav Gupta,/Profile/49vaibhavg,,10

tehri-gharwal,"Please do not even think of staying at this place until you are misadventurous ðŸ˜€... Derived my own word.   First of all the property address shows Tehri whereas this property is close to Dehradun and that too on Maldevta road completely off the cuff. Even worse is its maintenance and upkeep ... lots of insects being a hilly area and the staff has no clue on how to deliver an experience except one Assamese staff member who was very dedicated. A big NO if you are travelling with kids. Dirty swimming pool and nothing great about this property except you being looted 5k per room. Room are in sad state, curtains full of dust, irrational mattress are infested, etc.  Please avoid at all cost ... Rather suggest to stay a day extra in Dehradun or Missouri",Vishal S,/Profile/774vishals,"Thane, India",10
