tehri-gharwal,"Not many options in this town. We choose this because the staff was polite but only one speaks english and he is almost never around. The room is small but good. Could (and should) be cleaner since any wind full everything with dust from the hill. Is about 20 min walking and uphill to return.the restaurant was not available for this time, they were working, but restaurant from nearby hotel was ok, not the best, but again, not much options.",vitosm2017,/Profile/vitosm2017,Argentina,30
