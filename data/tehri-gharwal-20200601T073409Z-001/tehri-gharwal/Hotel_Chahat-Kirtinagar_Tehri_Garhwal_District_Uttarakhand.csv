tehri-gharwal,"Nice rooms, nice ambience and nice location though there is some scope for improvement.  Rooms were clean have a TV and since it was winters, a heater was also provided which was thoughtful of the hotel, though I did not feel the need to use it.  Helpful and cooperative staff. Good food and Hospitality.",Anjana P,/Profile/DrAnjanaPant,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,We stayed at this hotel as a group of 12 Yatris en route to Badrinath and Kedarnath. We had stopped by this hotel in the previous years for tea and snacks. This was the first time we happened to stay overnight. The hotel is situated on the river bank and the view is wonderful especially if its early morning with the sun and fog teasing each other  Rooms were neat Bathrooms were also clean Linen was clean Ample car parking space Food was good Wi-fi was not available while we stayed due to erratic signal  Comfortable stay and would like to prefer this place during my next yatra too,Wholesome_life,/Profile/Wholesome_life,"Chennai, India",40

tehri-gharwal,we wrongly took it as a hotel this is a marriage place. Rooms are for staying marriage guests. very ordinary rooms. no room service. no heaters in rooms we could get only 3 for 5 rooms we hired for world bank team and for us. as this is a marriage place you can not get room service. despite telling for morning tea we can not get any. I went to marriage halwai type kitchen to get a cup of tea. There was no one on reception till 8 am.I found a sweeper on gate who told me the room no. of the receptionist boy.the receptionist boy was sleeping in his room. he reluctantly got orders about breakfast sitting on his bed. no room service. I was  served cold omelette and lukewarm tea. rates are very high. so if you mistakenly take it as a hotel it will be a blunder. ,sanjay s,/Profile/sanjaygirital,,10
