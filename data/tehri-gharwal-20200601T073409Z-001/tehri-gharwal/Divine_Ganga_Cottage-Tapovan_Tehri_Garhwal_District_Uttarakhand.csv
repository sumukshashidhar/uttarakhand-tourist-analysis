tehri-gharwal,"I stayed for a month in March/April in very unusual circumstances as  the India-wide lockdown started the day after I checked in. That meant the majority of guests had already  left Rishikesh and only 15 remained. Over the next week all but four returned home to Europe on rescue flights. For the following three weeks we four, from the US, the UK, Germany and me from Australia. were accommodated by the hotel owners, Vivek and Seema Nanda. They and their three adult children and a grandmother were also caught in the lockdown and unable to return to Delhi.  We guests were shown extraordinary hospitality and friendship by the family and in fact treated as family. They could have closed the hotel to guests and let their staff go but they chose to protect their staff and their jobs",pollardy,/Profile/pollardy,,50

tehri-gharwal,"Amazing worth for money property. Right on Ganges view, amazing breakfast and service and warm hospitality. Initially took zostel room, but shabby rooms and no view or pathetic dump view killed it. Walked a bit, and reached here, which was suggested by my girls gang who have previously stayed here and also by one close associate, came here, amazing vibes and views at just 1500 odd more above the 2000 inr i was already paying. Also, proximity to the Tapovan Cafe area and river front with 100 meters odd walk made it a steal deal.

The owners and staff went above and beyond to make our stay the best it could be. We stayed in the beautiful newly built part of the hotel with the most breath taking views of the Ganga. The room was unexpectedly luxurious (comparable to a 4/5* hotel in the UK!) with a relaxing balcony, white linen and rai  forest style shower. It was also in  an excellent position for exploring Rishikesh and walking to our daily yoga classes and made a great base to come back to relax after completing the Chopta hike in the Himalayan foothills.

Lovely setting and stunning view. When we arrived in the evening they told us they had 3 restaurants- however we discovered that it was more like 3 seating areas, as they actually didn’t cook any food on site. It took 90 minutes to just get our drinks, and when food arrived there were several dishes missing. About 7 waiters/staff standing around and orders all mixed up. Very disorganised and frustrating.

It provides views to the north and one can watch the Ganga flowing out of the foothills of the Shivalik range, drawing one's imagination to the Himalayas beyond.

No other nearby hotel or anything cause of which this place is quiet too.   Room: booked base category of rooms although there were other categories too. Room was neither big nor too small. My room has view to the garden/entrance of the hotel. All the basic amenities like AC, modern bathroom was there.   Restaurant: Best part was you can order anything from the menu and you will not regret. ",Traveler_Arpit,/Profile/Traveler_Arpit,"Jaipur, India",50

The location of the hotel is the best thing; beautiful views and in a quieter part of Rishikesh. The shower is ok, and not hot water on demand, you have to plan when you're going to have a shower and flip on the switch and wait for it to warm up.  We were at this hotel during Holi, and they provided us with a 'play holi' if we were uncomfortable going out in the streets to participate in the festivities. With it being Holi, service was not good. We waited an hour for dinner before someone from our group went up to the kitchen to sort things out.

The grounds are well landscaped with local flowering plants and the view of the Ganges from the restaurant is to die for.

THE ""VIEW"" : The Ganga view rooms aren't really ""Ganga View"" as you are expecting. There is a shared, thin balcony with obstructed views (of a dining area or a construction site).

There is a beautiful open air balcony with a stunning view of Ganga. The food in the upstairs cafe is very homely and delicious - special compliments to the chef.  A few things make this place standout. We were all tired and my kid was not well. The chef took care to prepare 2 types of khichdi - plain and masala and both were simply delicious and we almost revived after that. The hosts, Vivek and Seema were very nice. Since my child was sick they allowed us use of the room even after we checked out and helped us with medicines, arranging an early cab etc..

tehri-gharwal,"We are absolutely shocked by the positive reviews for Divine Ganga Cottage. Perhaps many of them are non-authentic, which seems to be a common practice in India. This is unfortunate since we typically rely heavily on Tripadvisor for guidance during our travels.  It was so bad that we checked the address against Tripadvisor twice to make sure we were at the right place. It's dirty, the service is nonexistent, and the restaurant is terrible. In our three weeks in India, we found every place is a little quirky but usually something makes the place special. Ganga has nothing. At check in we noticed two signs, one for yoga and one for a hike. We asked about the yoga and the woman who checked us in said the teacher was on vacation today and she would call us to tell us what time class",Ryan D,/Profile/rydu_415,"Songshan, Taipei",10

Maybe I'm too long in India, but I stayed here last year for one night, having booked it on the strength of the reviews, it was super expensive, over 3000R, so you expect a certain level for that. The room was tiny, the bed uncomfortable, no tea or coffee in the room, towels were threadbare. But it was clean and the staff are very considerate. Although noisy. So, coming back to Rishikesh again now, I got a good deal through 'make my trip', much cheaper, more like the price it should be for the above room. And, I wanted to give it another go because of the reviews. This time they put me in a room which is about the standard of an ashram room.

We had the same question when we started our journey early morning from Delhi battling traffic jams at Modinagar, Manglaur and Roorkee.   Accommodation was booked after going through the website and some other references. However, there was always a doubt on the authenticity of details.   The doubt increased when we entered the narrow lane which took us to Divine Ganga Cottage. It merely took few minutes for all doubts to vanish and to achieve the rare feeling of making a good decision. The narrow lane which took us to the property eventually turned out to be a major reason for praising self for the good choice.

They made sure we were comfortable and adequately supported during our entire stay. We were in touch with Gautami since the day before check-in and she was professional as well as gracious in responding to all queries.

No mountain view (we paid for one). No towels (had to ask). Poor lighting in nice bathroom. King size duvet cover with only a single duvet inside but not realising this until in bed, sometimes you don't think they'd do that so the bottom half of our bodies was only covered by the duvet cover. No remote for TV (my partner studies Hindi), only found this out in the morning so didn't bother to ask for one but they didn't know where it was anyway. It was cold in the room but no heater and no information as to whether one was provided.

LaxmanJhula and the bank of Ganges is a 5 minutes walk. The owner does good job of personally connecting with the guests and enquiring about their needs in a genuine manner. He has a good team of people to support him. I got a homely touch at every aspect of the stay. The narrow lane that leads you to the property from main road is a bit difficult to tackle.

Vikram for Triveni ghat was arranged just at 10 min notice. Always got the right advice – e.g. Take Ambassador from the other side of Laxman Jhula for Neelkanth rather than booking a cab from the hotel. It saved us lot of time and money.

The rooftop restaurant with the panoramic view, the gorgeous location, the affectionate proprietors and the accommodating staff, all make this a place i'd love to return to. Set in a nook in the mountain side, the resort offers a stunning view of the ganga as it flows by. The proprietor, Mr. Nanda, while welcoming me upon my arrival, gave me a tour of the entire premises featuring, among other things, an organic vegetable garden and a charitable school for the local kids being run right beside the resort. Added to this, the proximity of the resort to the laxman jhoola and market ensures that visitors can enjoy the feeling of being in nature's lap and yet conveniently",j_rishabh_dev_,/Profile/j_rishabh_dev_,"New Delhi, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"Taking this trip reinforced my belief in basic goodness of people. From the heartwarming welcome, to planning your itinerary, to serving the best lemon honey tea, one really could not have asked for more from the staff. And to be experiencing such service in a place as beautiful as this hotel is the stuff dreams are made of. I have been there in July  and also in December and both times were memorable. For those who think that it's hot everywhere in June-July, I didn't even need to switch on the room fan during my afternoon siesta. C'mon guys, the mountain breeze cooled by Ganga flows right into your room. Mouth watering isn't it? And the cherry on the cake is the owner, Mr Nanda who was kind enough to help out in the smallest of matters.",Sachin C,/Profile/SachinC918,"New Delhi, India",50

tehri-gharwal,"I have just returned home to Australia following a trip in India. While in India I visited a place called Rishikesh and stayed at the Divine Ganga Cottage. The accomodation had an old world charm about it, the staff were very helpful, the food was amazing and the view from the balcony over looking mountains and the flowing river was to die for. It was a short and very interesting walk to nearby markets, restaurants and the mighty Ganga. Rishikesh is a must see and a complete contrast to the hustle and bustle of delhi.",Leith M,/Profile/LeithM,"Belair, Australia",50

My very first trip to Rishikesh and now it has become the most memorable trip for me, the best est part was to sit on the terrace of the cottage and enjoy the natural beauty and the chilly breeze in the morning with a hot coffee. Very pleasant experience will be thankful to the owners of Ganga Cottage to be so generous and friendly.

tehri-gharwal,"The Divine Ganga Cottage was a wonderful choice for my trip with six friends for the weekend. We're American students studying in Delhi, so we were looking for something relatively inexpensive and quiet without being too sparse. I booked two executive rooms and a deluxe room several days before our trip, and Seema was incredibly helpful on the phone. She helped us determine which rooms would best suit our needs and clearly explained the room and price differences. On the day of our arrival, we ended up calling Seema five times to confirm our rooms and because we had some logistical difficulties with auto drivers bringing us to the guest house from the Haridwar train station. Despite our flurry of calls, Seema was always patient, friendly, and responsive on the phone, and made",Traveler1769,/Profile/Traveler1769,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",50

tehri-gharwal,"A great location with superb ever changing view of the Mountains and River Ganges from the balcony.   The Manager and staff couldn't be more helpful in what ever was required from yummy meals to excursions.  The rooms are not 5 star, however they are most suitable for a comfortable and clean relaxing holiday with airconditioning and  fan. Private bathroom, comfortable bed, table and chairs.  TV (but why watch TV) when you can sit on the balcony to enjoy the views outside.   The chef can whip a a great meal when required, served with wonderful smile. Reception will be at your service to help with anything that you may need from tour, yoga, massage or  taxi and most places for shopping or temples are all within easy walking distance.  However there are a few hills and steps",Julie L,/Profile/JulieL925,"Perth, Australia",40
tehri-gharwal,A super view of the Ganga and always a fresh breeze blowing through the property. The whole atmosphere lends itself to a real peaceful stay. The Indian food was well flavored and we enjoyed many meals on the terrace overlooking the river. I definitely reccommend it as a good place to stay away from the crowds but still close to the action.,aga108,/Profile/aga108,"Zory, Poland",50

This hotel is recommended for those who are visiting Rishikesh for the first time as the friendly owner can organize tours, yoga workshops, treks, and massages for you as well as giving you very good advice on local places to visit.  The staff here are very friendly, although a language barrier can exist at times when trying to communicate in English!

Room was clean but we find the bed and pillow bit uncomfortable. Our main concern was our baby's food but the room service and kitchen staff was very friendly. They allowed us to made daliya, khichdi and other baby food in their kitchen and helped in every possible manner. We had paranthas in breakfast which was not that great but the pasta was great. Overall, food was OK nothing great. You can have your food in the market also which is 5-10min. walking distance.  Overall, affordable, nice and calm place away from crowd.
