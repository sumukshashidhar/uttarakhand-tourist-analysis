tehri-gharwal,"The hotel was very neat and clean. Staff was very professional. I loved the food at their restaurant. They grow some vegetables in their lawn and we had an opportunity to have it fresh. Kids loved the adventure activities at the hotel. When we went, there was snow everywhere...it was all like white blanket. They also put a bonfire. Amazing experience..want to go again.",Meera Gopal,/Profile/MeeraGopal,"New Delhi, India",50

tehri-gharwal,"Positives: 1. Food was good be it breakfast, lunch, snacks or dinner. Charges were also very normal.  Advice: Its better to have food at the restaurant itself and not at your room, if you want it to be served hot.  Negatives: 1. Hotel lacks basic amenities like extra blankets for a chilling weather like Dhanaulti's. The geyser in our washroom started working only after an hour once switched on.  2. The receptionist/manager at the hotel was not at all helpful. He could not guide us for available local places for sight-seeing or any nearby taxi points. While returning, he offered a taxi from Dhanaulti to Dehradun but cancelled it at the very last hour. We somehow managed to get an alternative medium at that time. 3. Hotel is around 6 kms from the main town of Dhanaulti, and around",Tarun,/Profile/TarunGoyal97,"Mumbai, India",20

tehri-gharwal,"The unforgettable memory of our stay of two nights at Dhanaulti in October 2014 is the panoramic view of the array of snow peaks across the blue sky, visible since dawn til sunset. The location of this hotel is unmatched. The glass front of the hotel facade reflects the Himalayan range. Our rooms, facing the valley were good, but could do with some improvement.",Piyessir,/Profile/Piyessir,"Kolkata, India",40
