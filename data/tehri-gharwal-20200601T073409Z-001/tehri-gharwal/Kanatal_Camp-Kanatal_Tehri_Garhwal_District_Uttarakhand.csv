tehri-gharwal,"We all know, what we expect at camping and at hill stations. But it becomes difficult to find that adventure and experience, Same is felt at this place. rather then camp it should be renamed to cottages. Further, Nice/Cool place to stay to take a day out from daily life and just relax. Do not expect anything alluring or hostile. Ya, The food is undoubtedly good.",Vipul Sharma,/Profile/iVipulsharma,"Greater Noida, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"Serene place to Visit. I Visited this place last year on 15th August and it was a Travel amongst the Clouds. Serenity at its best. Wooden Cottages, admist greenery, beautiful location.  We stayed at the Cottages right at the bottom of the Camps, it was a 100m trek toward the camps. Only issue if this place is Parking Facility. They arrange Adventure activities as well like Zipline, Burma Bridge, Rope Climbing etc., Food is good and Service is fine.",SahilChrungu,/Profile/SahilChrungu,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,I went for 2 nights stay with my colleagues to Kanatal camp and i was unhappy with their arrangements. The Tents were average. The bed was not so clean and asked them to change new bed linings but they were not having any extra bed sheets.  There was no mirror in the washroom Toiletries like bathing towel etc. were not available.,Rajat S,/Profile/RajatS829,,10
tehri-gharwal,"I went to this Place last year when I was looking for a break from my hectic delhi life. I went with a group I ride with  We got a package for Stay along with Breakfast and Dinner. The camps/cottages are very good,comfy and clean,  with a very good attached washroom.  They serve amazing buffet food with variety of food and I love the prepared chicken curry. The arrangement of Bonefire /Dj were really nice.  As we were expecting an adventure and raw stay , its serves a better option.",Mohit A,/Profile/mohita502,"Noida, India",40
tehri-gharwal,I went for a one night stay with my family to Kanatal camp and I was happy with their arrangements. It is far from the hustle and bustle of hill stations such as Mussourie & Dhanaulti and offers great view of the surrounding mountain range. The tents were average. Staff was friendly and the food served was good.,Aanchal A,/Profile/Aanchal107,"Ghaziabad, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"The tents were average, but neat and clean. Food was awesome and served hot. The bed was not so clean hence would recommend that before going ask for clean bed linings. The best part of the stay was trekking from the camp to Sarkunda Devi Temple. The view was amazing and temperature drops in the night from day drastically hence keep a jacket with you for the night stay.",Vikymania,/Profile/Vikymania,"Sahibabad, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"Stayed here for 02 nights and 03 days. Worst experience ever. 14th and 15th August 2016. Booked through make my trip on room only basis. @5300 inr for 4 pax, 02 nights for two tents. It is very expensive for room only and so less amenities in the tent. The caretaker there names Naveen at the check out tried to charge extra for lunch which we never had. But we didn't paid. Less space is the tent, no tv and there are no activities here (7 kms away from here)",ruvinnagpal,/Profile/ruvinnagpal,"New Delhi, India",10
tehri-gharwal,"Excellent view,Peaceful ,Very Good Camps , Good Food , we were very well taken care of A very well managed staff Little bit of power backup to be taken care of Rest overall a very good experience for the whole family Good luck Will come again and again ",Gaurav M,/Profile/GauravM833,,50
tehri-gharwal,"â€‹Never visit the Kanatal camp (kanatalcamp.com). You will book their camps hoping to enjoy far way from workplace however the rude staff (Praveen the coordinator) doesn't care about you.  We selected their ""super Deluxe camps"" and found following 'amenities':  1. Used bedsheets 2. Dirty wash-rooms 3. Inadequate water supply 4. Unhygienic food 5. There are no hangers in the camps nor in wash-rooms. This might sound awkward but this is important for everyone 6. Water clogging in wash-rooms 7. No zips in camp and wash-rooms 8. You can feel the water coming into the camp from the wash-rooms  Overall, the service and food is very poor. Few important things to be declared:  1. Dinner will be served till 9 pm and post that kitchen will be closed 2: Bonfire will be for 30-45 minutes",Ankit G,/Profile/AnkitG1209,,10
