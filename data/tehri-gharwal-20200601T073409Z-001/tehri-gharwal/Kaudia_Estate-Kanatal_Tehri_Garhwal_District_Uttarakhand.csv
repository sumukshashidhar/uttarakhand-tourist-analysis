tehri-gharwal,"Writing this review I thought to myself, how can words ever do justice to such a place? The truth is that they cannot!   I have been to the property 3 times over the last year and I can keep going back for more! The view is priceless, the experience - phenomenal! People say that a place is a must-visit at least once; I strongly believe this place brings new experiences every time I have been and I cannot wait for it to surprise me more.   From the fact, that you have freshly cooked meals in the middle of nowhere made by chefs and the warmth of a home, Kaudia Estates is a property like no other.",Adil Dhaliwal,/Profile/AdilDhaliwal,,50

tehri-gharwal,"Visited the estate last year with my parents, during winter-fall. Located amidst the Kaudia Forest, Kaudia Estate is the most beautiful among all estates I have ever been to. From breathtaking views of the Himalayas to well maintained outdoor lawn, beautifully decorated interiors to the soothing atmosphere, everything here is just perfect.   We booked 2 villas. Had a great time there. Must say the hospitality and the attention to detail on every aspects, make the estate stand out.  These luxury villas are perfect for someone willing to spend a weekend away from the hustle and bustle.   The kids enjoyed a lot. Played a lot of indoor and outdoor games available at the estate. Perfect for a family get together.   Would like to mention, our butler Balbeer ji, was very helpful and",RANGEET M,/Profile/rangeet2k20,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
tehri-gharwal,"Kaudia Estate is an exceptional private estate. The property is located at the edge of the Kaudia Forest and has three beautiful villas. We stayed at the Villa Woodrose which has fantastic view of the valley & has all modern amenities. The property is immaculately clean. I spent quite a lot time in the library, it has great collection of books. Our group had a great time doing meditation and yoga at the property, the yoga acharya designed a tailor made program for us, this is highly recommended and appreciated by everyone in our group. Great hospitality by the staff, special thanks to Rajinder the butler for exceptional service.  ",Anish Veigas,/Profile/anishveigas1990,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
tehri-gharwal,"No amount of words can sum up the experience of living here. Avinash & his entire team made us feel like royalty!! The attention to detail was remarkable, be it the L'Occitane toiletries, hot water bottles in the beds at night, home cooked cookies or the bespoke homely food that was prepared for us. Even the property has been designed with EVERYTHING in mind. All six of us couldn't come up with one thing they had not thought through.   As regards to the property absolutely STUNNING. Phenomenal view of the Himalayas, in pin drop silence, truly a getaway from the maddening city life but without leaving any of the luxuries behind.

tehri-gharwal,"One of the finest stays for me, ever. This property is a niche stay and has 3 villas with 3 suites in each. Every suite has uber Luxe decor and amazing views of the Himalayas facing right in front. One of the best things here is the quite and beauty that you get to enjoy in the lap of nature. Surrounded by beautiful flowers and breathtaking views. Also the food here is home cooked and made using local ingredients grown in nearby farms. The staff is very helpful and one needs to be very careful with the cold so carry enough warm stuff. It's one of the prettiest hillstation I have  visited and worth going there for a mini holiday",Msjunebug,/Profile/Msjunebug,"New Delhi, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"Extremely thoughtfully furnished. small asthetic touches and attention to detail is remarkable in every corner of the villa.   Each of the three bedroom villas is done up tastefully including a bar, living room with a fire place, music system to connect your favourite playlist and a kitchen with extended supplies at hand. Imagine a heated towel rack to enable warm towels at the end of an awesome shower is remarkable. The linen, furnishing, Toiletries of extremely high quality and can give a lot of luxury hotels a run for their money.   They have thought of every single detail !!!  The villa also has a personal library with a good selection of books in the cute attic space with an additional bed to lie and read is a great addition. They even had an entire set of Tin Tin comic",vishruty2k,/Profile/vishruty2k,"Mumbai, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"I came to Kaudia Estates with high hopes as I had heard a lot about it from our gracious hosts. As we arrived and got a first glimpse of what we were going to experience over the next 48 hours, I knew this one had topped my expectations by a good margin.   With this resort facing the significant peaks of Himalayas, one experiences the best of both nature and uber luxury. The Chalet style cottages are so well done, they leave you with a lasting impression. They enhance the natural beauty of the place.   The staff are super courteous and make sure your stay is a home away from home. Food is excellent and one cannot miss the variety fare that is offered, mostly from locally sourced items.

Very nice quiet place, tucked away from crowded places, nice clear view of the mountains!! The service provided by Rajender, Sushil and others was out of this world. The staff was so courteous and accommodating which made our stay even more fun.

tehri-gharwal,"This place is a FAIRYLAND. Ive been accross the globe and around India to quite a few places. But this place is one of the best places I've ever seen. The location is divine! As for the villas, Kaudia Estate has aced it. A fully equipped luxury villa with all kinds of entertainment like Karaoke,  board games, frisbee, an impressive library in a peaceful attic, table tennis, pool table etc. This place has it all! The interiors are done tastefully with attention paid to every little detail. The landscaping  and flowerbeds are a treat to the eyes!

tehri-gharwal,"In the lap of Nature’s paradise, millions of starts at night, beautifully maintained luxurious villa with the most courteous staff and mouth watering food made it one of our best stays. The property is nothing less than a Five Star Hotel level work at every level. It was our marriage anniversary too and the management and staff made it more special by adding a homemade cake to it!

tehri-gharwal,"Our stay at The Kaudia estate was an excellent break from the city hustle. We stayed in their luxurious villa and the Himalayan view from their beautiful Villa was splendid! Beyond the relaxing atmosphere of the villa, the next best part was the fantastic food and excellent service. The menu has a great variety of food choices and the services were customized according to our convenience. We couldn’t ask for more. The staff was very attentive, professional and friendly. There is biking, trekking and so much more to do. A wonderful mini-vacation!",Megha L,/Profile/MeghaL18,,50
tehri-gharwal,"I went for a stay at Kaudia Estate with some of my friends 2 weeks back and reached around 5:30-6:00 in the evening. We all were super tired after the train and road journey and all we wanted was our beds but then what a place...  It is an escape from the world where you get full network but you want to get away from all the hustle bustle and enjoy the scenic beauty.  2 days- spent well with leisure food- kadi, aaloo, spinach, mutton all cooked in the most authentic way and deserves all the recommendations.  A small trek is a bliss which is almost 5-10 mins away from the property and  one can spend quality time there and do a quick lunch.  The place inside out gives you a homely feel, the rooms are comfy, spacious, scenic and most importantly clean to the T.  There's a warmth",Neha Walecha,/Profile/NehaWa,,50
