tehri-gharwal,"This is a OYO network hotel, but they will not accept  booking made through OYO apps if customers pays online before check-in. You have to pay cash at hotel.   Rooms are so-so, but maintenance is very poor. Service is also poor.  In room geyser was leaking ( pictures attached) and door knob was broken.   Avoid top floor room.

tehri-gharwal,"I have stayed in this hotel for a day with my friends. This is a basic hotel so dont expect any luxury or any unique experience. But I was impressed with the cleanliness in the room, size of the room is small but interiors are nicely done. Room service is also good as the staff is quick to address any issues. They quickly provided the things we asked for. This hotel does not have any restaurant but they serve some limited things in room. So I can recommend this hotel if you are just looking for a comfortable stay overnight at an affordable price.",Kapil_Delhi_13,/Profile/Kapil_Delhi_13,"New Delhi, India",30
