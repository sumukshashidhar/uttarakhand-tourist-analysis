tehri-gharwal,Like always I look for some offbeat places to travel and same is what happened for this getaway of mine.  A very pleasent and scenic 40 minutes drive from Raipur Dehradun it was and we landed to the Peru Resort.  A very pleasent welcome by the staff at the reception. And to my surprise the rooms turned out to be extraordinary. Completely wooden finish and the detailing of the interiors was so close to perfect. And when I checked the balcony the view mesmerised me. Not to forget the cleanliness of the room and washrooms. Everything was spik n span. Up to the mark and state of the art.  Coming to the food. I would rate the food quality 5 out of five. And presentation was also nice. It's been an overwhelming experience for me this time.  Will recommend to every traveller who wants,onoutdoors,/Profile/onoutdoors,"Rishikesh, India",50
tehri-gharwal,This place was a nightmare for us.we were travelling with family of four along with small kid  and a senior citizen hence I was making extra sure that they don't have any problems in travelling part.My biggest mistake that I blindly followed the instructions of Ramesh  from peru resort who ensured us that this place is hardly 20kms from dhanaulti.Our next destination was devprayag so I asked him couple of times as google maps was showing something else but he rest assured me that this place is not very far from dhanaulti ad you will reach withing 40 mins.  even our taxi driver was very annoyed as he was also given the same instructions.we kept dtiving and driving and then found out that it is very close to Dehradun and not dhanaulti.we travelled for 2.5 hours and finally reached,Trupti K,/Profile/TruptiK90,"Mumbai, India",10
