tehri-gharwal,"The worst ever experience in my travel saga. We booked this hotel after seeing good reviews  and location pics,exactly 2 months before and transferred half amount ie. 2000rs,reminded them in between. When we reached on 30 th evening, the first glimpse itself was not satisfying. A small parking in front of a tin sheeted room,so called dining hall,not having enough lighting and a dull look.As we were over with check in process,we were waiting for the room key.Then the manager told us that they had a group booking of 40 youngsters,so its not safe to stay there with family and they will take us to family suits just 300m ahead. We were not happy and told him that we booked the hotel on account the scenic beauty. Anyhow we decided to move on to the family suit as were tired of long",Sruthy1234,/Profile/Sruthy1234,,10

tehri-gharwal,First of all the place location is good but nothing is like resort here. We stayed here for 1 day but feels like the person who manages this place was not quite good to handle his customers . We were not entertained by oyo rates and was over charged Rs3000 for each room even though we checked in late . After much of conversation things came down to Rs.2000 without BF/ dinner . Menu card rates were not being followed and unnecessary charges were been put up stating . For example we ordered a chicken curry for which we end up paying 400 inspite of its printed rate as 350 for full . We wanted to extend our stay for one day just because of the location but the manager here doesn‚Äôt feel bothered to reduce the rates and stuck at Rs. 3000 .

We have been to the same resort twice in the past three years. On our first visit, the resort was probably amongst lesser known places and the hotel service, cleanliness and food were awesome. Since we like to search for places that are away from the crowded tourist destinations, we zeroed in on 180 degrees resort and we weren't disappointed.   However, on our second visit (Feb 2017) the same resort was flooded with people. It was quite evident that the hotel staff and resources were not equipped well to handle the overflow of guests.

Room is too small with a village like furniture.. or better to say no furniture other than a rot iron bed.  Wooden table.. broken mirror.

The resort stands out from the rest because of its unique architecture and the location simply proves to be icing on the cake...",Jitendra3,/Profile/Jitendra3,"Navi Mumbai, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"This below average place is built at awesome location. The accommodation quality is poor. DO NOT go if your wife/husband/kids/relatives want at least a little bit of luxury or comfort. This place will do wonders for people who prefer staying outside their rooms for most of their time. For example: Boys/Men who prefer sitting in the lawn for drinks n' all and only go to the rooms to freshen up and sleep. The rooms are way too small. Bugs are common in the room during the nights. God save you if it has rained. Bathrooms are also very standard. I would say if you spend 3,000 - 6,000 per night, its better to stay in tents or camps there at Kanatal. Coz stay quality here at 180 degrees is as good or shall I say bad as living in tents. Tin roofs leak during rains.   I had booked this",Yohan S,/Profile/Yohan369,"Noida, India",10
tehri-gharwal,"Stupendous!!!  As the name suggest 180 degree resort offers you a 180' view of nature's beauty.  Amazing and breathtaking view of mountains and clouds all around as it was chilling cold ! Very exotic place for a weekend trip. Small rooms could give u the feel of a camp but they are clean and tidy! Staff and their hospitality was pleasant and they took good care of us. Food was yummy, like typical home-made one and we enjoyed the snacks  too! Precisely a marvellous experiece staying in there!",sanchit s,/Profile/sanchits2015,,50

tehri-gharwal,"amazing place. lawn where you can sit and drink in night. the path to rooms is little unstable but give you the feel of trekking, farm house below resort is great and you can buy also . nearby temple is a challenge where you have to climb by stairs and kids cannot do that its more than 140 feet steep climb. room service is okay, food is great. when you plan to go in winters it would be superb",Anshuman K,/Profile/77anshumank,,30
tehri-gharwal,"Firstly, spot booking prices were lower than online booking prices. Then the director- Mr Atul committed to charge us the prevailing tariff but refused at the end of the stay.   The facilities were pathetic. Filled with mosquitoes and wild insects. There was no power backup and we had to stay in dark during power cut. The approach to the room was very uncomfortable and risky. The rooms were less than basic. Dirty linen and blankets were provided. The bathroom door jammed, while one of us was inside.  Only saving grace was the surrounding landscape. But that's simply because it's middle of nowhere.   Please avoid ",mukundsanghi,/Profile/mukundsanghi,"Udaipur, India",20
tehri-gharwal,180 degree is a very simple resort with a great location. The view from the resort is breathtaking. Please dont expect anything fancy here. Rooms are small and just have a bed and a chair and a very small TV. We stayed there for 2 nights. 1st day was fine but second day the resort was fully packed and there was a total chaos. We ordered some snacks which were not served even after waiting for 2 hrs. Chilly chicken that we ordered was half cooked. There was not enough staff to serve food. Even the cook was serving food outside. Ice was not available.  Snacks that we ordered and were not served were added to our bill.  Basically they dont have enough staff to cater to the needs of people. Also there are quiet limited options in food.,Aarti2005,/Profile/Aarti2005,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
tehri-gharwal,"This resort is exactly 7 kms from Chamba in a picturesque village, Kanatal. It has 10 cottages each having 2 rooms. There is ample parking space for around 15 cars inside the resort. It has a small garden and the cottages are at a split level below. Each cottage boasts of beautiful mountain views with brilliant sun-set vistas. You can see the Surkhanda Devi temple from each cottage. Check-in was smooth, rooms are basic offering you a comfortable bed with a table (they don't have wardrobes), a table fan and basic toiletries (2 shampoos and a small hand soap). The windows in the room ensure that others can hear whatever you speak (so much for privacy). Food is the one thing that sets this property apart; excellent.

tehri-gharwal,"I was at the property with the family for a weekend in May. The resort location was quite good but the whole experience came to a standstill as soon as we were at the reception of the resort. The breakfast, snacks and dinner package which was agreed on the phone was changed with lot of riders now and the snacks part came with extra charges now.  In the evening, we ordered some veg and non-veg snacks at around 7:30 PM but received them only after 9 PM. The French fries which I received were drenched in oil, when complained, the manager said that the potatoes were not good. The chicken was not good either and we left the plate full as it is. I had asked for boiled eggs for my little one but they couldn't get that either until 9:30 PM, which made us very annoyed as they didn't",Rajat Y,/Profile/TravellerRajat,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",20

On the face of it,its a simple resort but you must stay there to enjoy the serenity and peacefulness of the place. Each room gives an amazing view of the mountains. If you want to get an actual feel of a hill station and do not intend to burn a hole in your pocket then this is the place.

The resort is pretty clean and is much recommended if you want to stay in a budget accommodation. Its in a quite place and you can spend value time with nature admiring the pristine surroundings.

tehri-gharwal,"We were a group of 5 in a hired Innova. Went a day before Holi in March, 2014. The roads in most of uttarakhand were terrible, broken and underprepared (compare them with the roads on the Rajasthan highway and you'll know what i am talking about). We reached mussoorie but lost our way a bit because of lack of proper signage and boards to kanatal. Many locals did not even know where kanatal was (may be because we were pronouncing it wrong - its supposed to be Kaanaa - taal - like nainital)  CONNECTIVITY: You have to take the bypass road to dhanaulti. Kanatal is some 17km further up the Dhanaulti Eco Park. There is a serious lack of signage in the area so watch out.

The food served in the resort were great and worth enjoying. One who loves to enjoy the nature should once go there and definitely by a hired car which is with you all the time of your stay as getting a car from there is not possible.
