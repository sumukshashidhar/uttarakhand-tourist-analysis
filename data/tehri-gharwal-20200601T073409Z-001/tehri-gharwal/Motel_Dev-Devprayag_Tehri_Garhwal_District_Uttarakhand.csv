tehri-gharwal,"This Hotel Comes Under The Category Of OYO Rooms Wven Then They Do Not Provides Even Free Daily  Water Bottle,They Give You Water In Plastic Jug, Staff/Waiter Was Of Under Age That Is 15 And Unmature , They Even Do Not Know How React/Respond To The Guest, When Before Giving Order Of Dinner I Asked What Do You Have In Snacks ? Rather Than Giving Any Answer They Stared Laughing By Seeing Each Other, At Last Food Was Ok",rajat143,/Profile/rajat143,"Karnal, India",30
tehri-gharwal,Nice hotel with nice view.  This is a motel. No room service for food. One can go to restaurant and eat. Ample parking space. Situated at main road. It djfjgvgvfchdhchvhjgjhvbjfhgvhjgvhfjjjghhjhkghhhhxj,gaurav@asr,/Profile/349humanh,,40
tehri-gharwal,"The hotel is located at a beautiful location with nice views of the Prayag/Sangam. The balconies are common with adjacent rooms, but the sheer size of balconies ensures that your privacy does not take a back seat. This is a real Budget hotel that perfectly fits ones pockets. The main problem here would be the food which they are not very much bothered about. There is nothing in the name of variety in food. It is better for one to stock oneself with snacks here as there are not shops near to this hotel. Rooms are very clean and tidy and also have bath-tubs (which was a pleasant surprise for me). I would any day prefer to stay at this Motel when I go to Devprayag every time.",Pratap V,/Profile/pratapv2016,"Chennai, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"I planned a visit to my ancestral home and decided to stay at Motel Dev on the way, to my surprise (despite of previous review) I was treated like a family and the services were customized as per my wishes, Well needless to say my any trip back home will have Motel Dev on my stop list ;) ... I wish them Good fortunes and satisfied clients for upcoming business.  As a suggestion I would like to see the Restaurant have an Improved overall interior to match the price of stay (2350INR including Breakfast :D woohoo )",Rahul D,/Profile/dobhal87,"New Delhi, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"We stayed at Motel Dev for a night while going Badrinath from Delhi.  Though the location of the Hotel (or Motel) is the best one is vicinity as one can see the confluence best from balcony (common) from this place, yet the manager or person looking after this propoerty (Mr. Anil Tripathi) was least courteous I have ever seen.  Single sentence every time he was uttering that ""I am the only person here"".  He even denied to serve proper food at the dinner (yes on payment!) and said that ""I am the only person here and cannot cook as per your choice."" Not recommended.",Anil G,/Profile/anilg731,"New Delhi, India",10
tehri-gharwal,Motel Dev is located right on NH 58 just outskirts of Dev Prayag Town overlooking the rivers. We took a journey break at Motel Dev returning from Auli to Delhi. They seems to have 2 category of rooms. One with AC and another without AC. Prices are really low. Almost half of what travel websites qoute for this motel. They always have few rooms to spare. Their rooms are average but comfortable. Very good for one night stay. Food is extra. You need to order what you like and pay accordingly. In the evening you can sit outside your room with view of rivers. They have safe parking area. Staffs are courteous. But service sometimes get slow due to mad rush in restaurant.,rashmiranjan1,/Profile/rashmiranjan1,new delhi,40
