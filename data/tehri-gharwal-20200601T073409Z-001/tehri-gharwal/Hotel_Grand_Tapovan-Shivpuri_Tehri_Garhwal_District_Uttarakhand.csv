We stayed there on our way to Kedarnath and on our way back from Badrinath. Inspite of reaching there in very odd late night hours . They accommodated our needs . Kept food ready for us ( as we called them ahead on our return) and rooms ready . Dimple Rawat who was at the reception in the night made sure we were provided what we asked for. Special thanks to Dimple, Meena and Sooraj for attending us at our arrival and in the breakfast time. Food was delicious. Rooms were neat and tidy. The whole experience was amazing.

tehri-gharwal,Looks like a fancy hotel from outside. We decided to go n have our lunch in their restaurant. They had a fancy menu but 3/ 4 th of the dishes were unavailable. We ordered aloo kofta n dal . Because that was the only options we had. Dal was fine but the rest was insipid. Jeera aloo was ugly n stale I guess. The food took hours to come. Some issue with their gas stove etc... Though the waiter and manager were nice and courteous . They apologied n tried to help but couldn't do much. N the bill pinched our pockets as the food was not worth it. So overall a very disappointing experience.,Aparna S,/Profile/aparnas513,,20

tehri-gharwal,"I recently stayed at this hotel as part of a group as we were undertaking a training course over the weekend. We mostly shared rooms with one or other person on the course, so the rooms we had were twin rooms. Firstly, the location wasn't what I expected because the hotel is right on the main Dehradun road which is very unfortunate at the moment because they are widening the road and there was a LOT of dust and traffic issues right outside, including making parking for our vehicle difficult. However, once inside the hotel it was quiet enough and the rooms were large, clean and tidy, with well-functioning ACs, a kettle and a TV. The beds were very comfortable and there was shelving alongside for essentials like an alarm clock and phone. The hall we used for the training was great",wjw2018,/Profile/wjw2018,"Umhlanga Rocks, South Africa",30

After searching a couple of hotels including GMVN options, we found this one just on the main Badrinath - Hrishikesh Road. Probably being an off season (Long weekend was just finished), we also got good bargain price (Poochne mein kya jaata hain kinda stuff). The Rooms were spacious, neat and clean.  The Hotel also has Restaurant, overall food is good, but they don't serve any South Indian Dishes yet, although it's mentioned in their menu card.  Rooms at any side I believe are good, as they give a good hill view.  The Next day morning we all went for Ganga Snan.
