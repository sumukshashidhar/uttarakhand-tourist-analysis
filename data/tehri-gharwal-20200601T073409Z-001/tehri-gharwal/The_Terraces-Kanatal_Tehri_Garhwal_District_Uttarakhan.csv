tehri-gharwal,"I have heard about this resort and seeking opportunity to visit the place for a long time. Fortunately this October one of my nephews agreed to accompany me and he took charge of booking the accommodation for two nights although this is not the best time to visit the hills but I couldn't resist myself. The accommodation is wonderful and the staff there will not allow you to feel bored. They will take care of you in every respect. The accommodation is the only one in the surrounding area for viewing the snow clad mountains at 180° radius if the sky is clear. There are two types of cottages, classic and premium. Premium type of cottages are the best for viewing the snow clad mountains even from the bedroom. Rates include breakfast and one meal.

The spa experience was amazing. The only sore point is the presence of a discotheque within the premises. You go to a hill station to seek calm surroundings, but as soon as the evening descends, they open up the disco and then you feel you are sitting in a Delhi mall. Worse still, the walls are not sound proof so you hear all the Bollywood jhintak numbers sitting in the midst of hills. This was the only sore point, because of which I don't think we would ever go back there. But if you are looking at dancing in the hills, go for it.
