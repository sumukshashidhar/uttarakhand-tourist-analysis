tehri-gharwal,"The hotel is on the main road. At first one just sees a restaurant on the road and kind of gets disappointed as to, is this the place I will stay but rooms are down the hill and quite spacious. The staff is courteous. I ran out of cash and Dhanolti does not have an ATM. The hotel staff was kind enough to charge my credit card and give me cash at nominal charge. I was wondering I will have to drive 1hour to withdraw cash as not many businesses except credit card here. But really thankful to the hotel. Also, the hotel is around 5 minutes drive from dhanolti. Away from the hustle and bustle. This quiet town is now picking up with more and more people coming.",Akapoor_Traveller,/Profile/Akapoor_Traveller,"Ghaziabad, India",50
