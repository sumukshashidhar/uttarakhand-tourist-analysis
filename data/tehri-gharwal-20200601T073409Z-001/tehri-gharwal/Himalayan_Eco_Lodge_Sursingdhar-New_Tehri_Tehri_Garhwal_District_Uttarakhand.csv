tehri-gharwal,"Often it's well said then well done but this Himalayan Ecolodge in New Tehri leaves your senses spell bound and you just feel lost amidst the Snow clad peaks and clouds. My Birthday was around and we were eager to do something not knowing what exactly, so we took a road less traveled considering the time we had in hand. The decision that was made hurriedly happened so that I had the most memorable of Birthdays. Away from the hustle bustle, up in the mountains yet all comforts at disposal, I spent my time doing things I rarely do. The service was impeccable and the staff was always on their toes with whatever you ask for. I wonder how people in Himalayas are so hospitable. On our way we covered multiple destinations but at experience at Sursingdhar Himalayan Eco Lodge New Tehri",itraveltrek,/Profile/itraveltrek,India,50
tehri-gharwal,You get to tell a lot about hospitality when a company of several men come out in the parking just to receive you with all smiles at -5 Degree Celsius. Enter the room and the room service has already tucks your luggage in with lights and geyser on!  Each and every minute detail was taken cared off with a smile on their faces.

tehri-gharwal,"Lovely views of the Himalayan snow peaks, cosy cottages, nature walk, messemerizing sunrise and sunset, star lit night sky and a courteous manager are some of the features of this place. The location of this property is far from the maddening crowd, but definitely provides the perfect solitude or great opportunity to connect with yourself as well as your loved ones. Early morning sunrise is a must experience thing here, as beholding the clouds down in the valley gives a special feel of ""aaj mai upar, zamana hai neeche....."" feel.",Shailesh S,/Profile/307shaileshs,"Noida, India",50
tehri-gharwal,I was initially very sceptical while checking into the property as we were the only guests in the property on that day. My fear starts vanishing after receiving the warm welcome from the property keepers. The sight from the lake view room makes you spellbound.

Their chef is very talented and the food is probably one of the best in the area. Their stuffed parathas and seasonal vegetables are a must try. Other than these basic comforts, they also have some loveable mountain dogs around the vicinity, who will keep you engaged if you are a dog lover. 💛",Aishwarya B,/Profile/AishwaryaB22,,50
tehri-gharwal,"Not an eco venture at all. It’s a commercial property with a mobile tower installed right in the middle of the resort. One goes there to relax unaware of staying right under the heavy dose of radiation being emitted by the mobile towers. Those going there with young ones, be kindly beware of the harmful effect of such mobile towers which are allowed to be installed by the owners simply for their commercial purposes, unmindful of serving their clients with the cocktail of radiations.",VINAY,/Profile/mongiavk,,30

We have requested to cook one or two items without chilly for kids. He did an awesome job. View from all the cottages were mesmerising. I liked their welcome drink. Property is located at the beautiful location. It had such a wonderful surroundings, less crowded. We had a peaceful time with family and friends.  We were highly disappointed with the maintenance of the property. We took one cottage which has two rooms and two washrooms. Geyser in one of the washrooms was not working and it took so long to make it worked. Furniture and fittings were very old and not maintained well.

Team has provided so many things free of cost - daily 2 times milk for kids and tea all the time.  1 - The food was nice and homely.  2 - Nework connectivity - they have mobile tower within resort.

When we reached at 6pm,  even then the rooms were not ready and they made us waiting for one hour. Even no one courteous enough to ask for glass of water. The property is maintained well at all.  There are no intercom system to connect with room service.. Even if they have given you their cell number but half of the time they wont pick the call or call you back. The manager was not very helpful and had a very lax attitude towards our concerns. Room service is very poor. Only Jio and Vodafone network works there.

The view is of the sun and clouds dancing merrily.We got to see snow covered peaks in Feb from afar and pandav leni. Would reccommend to plan your stay well,as there are lots of places you can visit nearby.As it can get all too cozy with the sumptous food and  the gorgeous views to stay back and get frozen in the picture. A short stay here is worth it.I bet there's lot more to do nearby ( around 20 - 30 km below) be it trekking and many more activities which we found only on our way back and were short of time.

Eco lodge is very non-economically  sprawling and because it was near empty the place appeared all the more as there were no ends to those special corners, rooms for an evening get together, or even for reading books and not to mention the open spaces and lawns that one never tires out to explore.

The place is not known by many and till the time you reach chamba and start going towards New tehri, you wont even see any board carrying the name of sursingdhar. However, after 8-9 km from chamba, there is a sharp  right turn which from where this place if a 2 km drive. The drive and the place is surrounded by pine trees and the cottages are indeed having a great view. I stayed in the family cottage. There is no TV in the room but who want it anyways. Service standards are ok with no intercom in the rooms. The boys at the lodge were very responsive and we were taken on trek to a temple and nearby village as well.

The food served has good taste but Cleanliness is not upto the mark.as far as kitchen is concerned.  Also The blankets are not clean. 4. Staff is extremely good, hard working and courteous. ( led by manager Mr. Kuldeep, equally hard working.) But no. of Staff is insufficient and not properly trained. ( I think this is management issue and management should carry out training programmes regularly. I think as management is not providing sufficient staff and training, it is unnecessary putting lot of pressure on the staff .",VBP69,/Profile/VBP69,"Pune, India",30

The infrastructure seems to be all in place but the staff could do better. They need to be more attentive and nor serve cold omlettes in breakfast, or light candle under the serving pots for lunch and dinner, change the menu a bit.

Soon the answer emerged - Tehri district has been a controversial topic over the past few decades due to the dam construction and relocation of local residents; the place is not part of any popular pilgrimage / tourist route; the people of this town are by and larqe employed by the Dam Project or farmers therefore not dependent on tourism for their livelihood. So a 'billboard and weekend reveller-free' hill town is what New Tehri is best described and within that is a peaceful, picturesque hill called Sursingdhar where this lodge is located.
