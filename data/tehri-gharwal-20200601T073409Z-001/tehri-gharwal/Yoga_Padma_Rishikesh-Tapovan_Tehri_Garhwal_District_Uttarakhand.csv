tehri-gharwal,"I stayed at yoga padma for a month and it was amazing. The owner and his family was really kind and they made sure everything was OK during my stay. The place is super clean, there's hot water in the bathroom (which sometimes is not always granted in Rishikesh), you have a shared kitchen with a fridge and water filter and a yoga shala on top. The only downside was the construction going on in front of the house, but at night you won't hear a thing.  I absolutely recommend this place.",Fernando P,/Profile/ferpasquel,"Mexico City, Mexico",50
tehri-gharwal,"Well its been a year back when i stayed at this place and had the best of the best experience. The family lives at the ground floor, extremely hospitable, very very helpful. Reaching this place is quite difficult though but the Host comes down to pick you up. This place is actually yoga training place, all three brothers are involved into this programme. This place is completely managed by the owners(including cleaning and maintenance), The rooms are clean and beautiful, it also includes kitchen which has all required utensils and basic Indian masalas. You can cook yourself(and should wash your used utensils) but you need to buy the raw materials yourself from the nearby grocery shop, good for those who loves to cook within the nature since the kitchen window opens to a",Depankar G,/Profile/depankarg2016,"Bengaluru, India",40
tehri-gharwal,Luckily we had spent over a month occupying one of the 2nd floor room of the Padma Yoga building due to the construction noise going on AYM school that we were originally booked & not notified about any loud construction activities prior to our arrival! It is cute little nice & quiet building run by a very nice family that we had a pleasure of getting to know. Elderly mother & father with their sweet son and his lovely young wife and a 2 yr old son were very attentive to our needs. It's a very simple accommodation but this family's energy made a lasting happy memories for my daughter and I. So to ultimately thank them I'm writing this review and highly recommend staying at their little place which felt like home for us!
