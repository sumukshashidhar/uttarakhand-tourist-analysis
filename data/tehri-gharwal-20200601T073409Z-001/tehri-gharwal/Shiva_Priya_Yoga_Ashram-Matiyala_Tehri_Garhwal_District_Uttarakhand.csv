tehri-gharwal,"What a wonderful renewing visit to this new and incredible ashram retreat! The facilities and accommodations were comfortable and immaculate, and the food was both delicious and healthy. Just let them know in advance and they will cater to any allergies or dietary restrictions.The ashram is located in a peaceful forested area surrounded by stunning and inspirational nature. We were so glad not to be in Rishikesh and away from the chaos of a city environment yet close enough to pop over for the day if we wanted to. The yoga teacher Yogacharya Sandeep was excellent and highly knowledgeable. We enjoyed all of the yoga classes and meeting others from around the world also seeking healing, knowledge, spirituality and connection with like minded others. My friend and I also really",Pamela L,/Profile/pamelalO2353UE,,50
