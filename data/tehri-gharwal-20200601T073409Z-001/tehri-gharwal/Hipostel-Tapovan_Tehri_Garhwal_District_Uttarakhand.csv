tehri-gharwal,So me and 4 other friends of mine visited Uttarakhand back in January and after a hectic night of camping we ended up in Hipostel Rishikesh. We had made the bookings online a month earlier and we were searching online for hostels for a cheaper option to stay and we knew from the first glance that Hipostel was the exact place we were looking for. We checked-in in the evening and the vibes were just warm and welcoming like visiting an old friends home. We were welcomed by the host Chirag (Property Mgr) and were shown our room. We instantly ordered for a Pink Sauce Pasta  and Coffees and wow we were literally in Cloud 9. The pasta was super delicious and the coffee was amazing too and we forgot  about h what a long day we had.

tehri-gharwal,"My man being a typical Delhi guy was a little cynical about our stay in hipostel as he wanted to stay in some nice normal HOTEL and not HOSTEL. Since I have already stayed in hipostel I know it was going to be amazing. After reaching there seeing the property and the surroundings and also after spending a day, when he got familiar with everyone there the extended family of hipostel what I call, their staff and owners ... He wanted me to extend our trip. And I won the bet which we agreed upon at the beginning of our journey. I can't thank Alaknanda and Kapil (owners) more for making our stay a memorable one. And also that we have them as our friends for life. Hipostel is a home made in the lap of lush green mountains where the wind sings for you and the calmness whispers the",chetts0228,/Profile/chetts0228,,50

tehri-gharwal,"We went to this Hostel's cafe (Hiphostel) and the manager was not only high on weed, but definitely other drugs he was acting so insane. We got to the end of our drinks (hot chocolate) and there were ants at the bottom of our drinks. ANTS! It made one of us throw up, and it was so disgusting we will never ever be going back there again. I never will recommend this place, I can't get over how high the manager was and how there were dead bugs in our drinks...",Baylee,/Profile/B-Traveler1010,,10

tehri-gharwal,"Ever wondered how is it to stay amidst the mountains away from the city, to lie down under a starry sky, to feel the cool breeze slowly hitting your face as you forget all the things happening around you. If you‚Äôre looking for such a place, Hipostel is the perfect place. We had never experienced a hostel stay before this so we were excited to meet new people, interact with them and exchange our thoughts and ideas. Hipostel didn‚Äôt disappoint us. When we came here, we were greeted by Mr. Kapil (owner) and the rest of the staff. They were all very polite and friendly and made us feel welcomed. It was a nice and clean dorm room with five beds that we had booked. If you have any problems you can contact the reception and they‚Äôll help you immediately.

tehri-gharwal,"I have always believed that a hostel is made up of the people in it, be it a guest or a host and in this instance it can't be more true. On my visit, for a split second it was hard to make out the guests from the hosts, in a good way. All of them were so welcoming that no amount of time would be enough to spend there.  The climb to the hostel is a bit of a struggle but when u get there, u realise how much worth it was. Located away from all the hustle bustle of the city yet at a very much accessible place, this hostel graces you with an experience worth treasuring.

tehri-gharwal,A lovely hostel that‚Äôs well decorated! However it‚Äôs in a bit of a random location up a hill that taxis and tuk tuks don‚Äôt like to drive up.

tehri-gharwal,Hipostel is new and run by a young hip Indian couple with local workers located away maybe 15 minutes away from the busy center. Their hospitality is warming and they just want you to relax and enjoy the good vibes. I love the hammocks and tents and would definitely sleep outside if it was not winter. You wake up to amazing views of the mountains because of the location and the decor and colors are bright and fun. My favorite part was circling around a little fire and laughing together.,Tu Anh Phan,/Profile/Tubdharma,,50

From the super comfy beds, to the musical evening, manmauji Cafe, the view , everything was serene. And the most important thing were the owners Kapil bhaiya and Alaknanda di. They were more than the owner of Hipostel, they became our friends and you know you made a great friend during your visit when you meet these amazing people.
