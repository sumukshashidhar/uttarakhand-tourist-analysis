tehri-gharwal,"Organized a group trip for Chamba & Bharmour on first week of July,2019. Booked on line hotel Iravati for a night stay. Location wise, the hotel no doubt is very good. Market,shopping center,ground all are just a few steps from the hotel campus but there need some improvement. We stayed at first floor of the hotel. The adjacent balconies of each room were very dirty. Room & Bathroom quality was not up to the mark. Staff were sober & helpful.",sanaser,/Profile/sanaser,Ludhiana,30

River is closeby. Museum, Church , Temples and market are at walking distance. The steward who served in the room was polite and courteous. The manager asked the feedback personally.
