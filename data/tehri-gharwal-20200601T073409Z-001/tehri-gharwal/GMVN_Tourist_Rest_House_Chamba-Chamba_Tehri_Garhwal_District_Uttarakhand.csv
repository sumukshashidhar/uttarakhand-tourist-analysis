tehri-gharwal,We stayed in this Rest House for four days. It is located at the hill top and gives a very beautiful view on all sides. Rooms are clean. The food is prepared as per the order and is simple but good. A very limited staff but very polite and co-operative. The place is in dire need of renovation. Peaceful place to relax.,surendra s,/Profile/952surendras,"Ghaziabad, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"Lets start with the pros first.  This place has a beautiful view from the balcony. The rooms are clean. Bedsheets provided were clean. Food provided was simple fare and tasty, More like home - cooked food. Be sure to place your order a few hours in advance for them to procure materials. This ensures everything is super fresh. But it also means you cannot have maggi or pakoda on a whim just because the weather turned amazing. So lets list the cons. The place is run down and needs renovation badly. The nets on the window to keep insects out are half broken/ eaten. The doors need replacing. The dining room wasn't functional when we went and food was required to be served in the room only. The sofas are dirty and better left unused. Running water may disappear suddenly. One can see",Asmita G,/Profile/634asmitag,,20
tehri-gharwal,"I stayed at the hotel recently for  one night, with my mother. We reached there in the evening , when we called the manager for the location from Chamba he told me to search for another accomodation as there was no electricity in the hotel. We were shocked to hear this at  the last moment.We drove to the hotel, which is at least 2-3 kilometres from the main city. Manager wasnt there , but the staff in the hotel provided us candles,extra blankets and did his best to make us comfortable. There is canteen facility , so we got warm tea and freshly cooked dinner. In the morning, we saw that the hotel has a beautiful location but it is not at all maintained. Building requires maintenance . Hotel needs to look into proper garbage disposal as we saw , lot of trash being burnt on one",octjan16,/Profile/octjan16,"Dehradun, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"This guest house is a typical example of how the government functions, the guest house is short of staffs. The room is at a poor state and washroom is in bad shape. When we visited there was only one staff taking care of atleast 30 guests. I am pretty sad to see that how the money is being wasted by not taking care of the property.",ManishMonu,/Profile/ManishMonu,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",20
tehri-gharwal,This is lesser known chamba compare to himachal's. This property situated on hill which offers some damn good views out of room. In monsoon it almost comes amidst of clouds. If you don't have your own transport than reaching here can be a task since from market which is last stop for public transportation it has hilly distance of  around 2-3 kms.   Property seems okay from outside but room condition is worse than outer surface. It has got large parking and lawn which can be a good option to spend evenings with piping hot tea & snacks.   Rooms are large but in very old condition which demands maintenance immediately. Condition of bathrooms are similar to rooms. They have attached a gallery so you can optimize the view from your own room itself.    Bed and linen can play,Manandani,/Profile/Manandani,"Mumbai, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"The place is at amazing location ... It is at peak of one of the higher mountains in the area.  One can enjoy Sunset and sunrise from hotel .

tehri-gharwal,"We stayed 2 nights in the GMVN guest house in Chamba and would strongly advise the Garhwal Mandal people to close the guest house and renovate immediately - it is in such poor shape with doors and windows in derelict condition, bedclothes dirty and musty, bathroom ceiling green with fungus/mold. The authorities should not allow such a place to function till they meet minimum standard of hygiene and health safety. The staff however was good and helpful. The 2 stars are for the location and staff.",MGoel2014,/Profile/MGoel2014,"Noida, India",20
tehri-gharwal,"We went as a group of 20 + people , we have booked the whole place of 5 Rooms , The view was great . This place is on top of a hill, has a small temple next to it .  A very helpful staff who helped us , right from putting extra beds to organizing customized satvik food . I will recommend to go here with a group and just be there",Sonal C,/Profile/sonalc152,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
tehri-gharwal,The GMVN rest house in Chamba is a few kms from the main market and is advisable only if you have your own vehicle.  The place itself needs maintenance but is neat and clean.  There is no running restaurant but they do have a kitchen and dining hall.  The kitchen has limited options but if you tell them in advance then they provide customized options as well.   The view from the first floor is nice.   The place is usually not full and has only 5 rooms. The family suites are nice with 4 beds and are a good value for money.,PiyushDEL,/Profile/PiyushDEL,Bangalore,30
tehri-gharwal,No doubt people regard this location as a slice of heaven. Nested among trees and mountain range scenes. Many people get confused this chamba with Himachal Pradesh's chamba but if you are sucker of nature and tranquil weather this place is to be. Stayed after completing our char dham yatra via rishikesh and after steep walk of around 2 kms from drop point which was in the market we felt refreshed the moment opened our room window.   Room and bathrooms are basic so are beds and other facilities but view is the usp of this place and its worth every effort / penny + second of it.  You will require heaters throughout year due to chill weather. Listed menu has limited options yet offerings are tasty mostly.  Budget required for stay is pretty low. Clubbing with rishikesh is,chiragm1,/Profile/chiragm1,"Mumbai, India",40

tehri-gharwal,"Chamba is a very beautiful getaway place to chill-out, not to expect too much of places to see around. And GMVN is a tourist organization run by state government of Uttarakhand.  The GMVN tourist house in Chamba is a very good facility in a prime locality, but we see lack of willingness in the staff to make it equally presentable to the visitors. The building and the rooms are not neatly maintained. The furnitures are not comparable to the ones seen in a decent private hotels, but quite good for the prices at which they are offered. Cleanliness is just around satisfactory level. The staffs' interest to keep the customer satisfied is never obvious. May be, it is discovered with customers' willingness to pay tips.  What I liked extremely is the way you feel when you open the",nagarajjois,/Profile/nagarajjois,"Bengaluru, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"I have stayed in this guest house twice.  Once alone and next time with my family.  As this is located on the hill top away from the market place, a good place to spend a few days quietly.  The view from this place of the icy range is wonderful  We were given the first floor corner room with four beds which is three sides open.  It enjoyed our 3 days stay.  We had a good and enjoyable stay.",Sukhindu,/Profile/Sukhindu,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"We stayed at Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam tourist rest house (GMVN TRH) at Chamba. It is quite far away from main market (more than 1.5 Km) and located uphill. The way to the rest house is steep climb and me along with my two kids could not even think of walking down to rest house from main market. Do not expect much from main market. Its a village market with very small shops. There are not even good eating places. Although there are many dhabas near main bus stand.  The rooms at TRH are spacious and neat and clean. I made booking for family suite from gmvn website. It was easy. The price is also very cheap. Just Rs 750 per day. The TRH has a nice lawn where kids can play on their own, although there are no swings.   The beds, blankets, towels they provided were clean and in fact",Vakul G,/Profile/vakulg2016,"New Delhi, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"During our Chamba trip we stayed at GMVN Tourist Rest House, Chamba. The GMVN Tourist Rest House is locate about 2 kilometres from the main road and the main market. We stayed in a family suite on the first floor. The balcony in front offered a beautiful view of the hills. The room service was good.
