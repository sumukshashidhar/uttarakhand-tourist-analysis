tehri-gharwal,"We had  planned to visit Rishikesh and went online to find hotel, and we get to know about hotel tapovan. We called there and booked for room. As it was a very pleasant stay and the staff are very good.  The hospitality that were offered to us was above the mark which we expected.  The hotel management are really precise about their work and always on the toes to serve their guest.  Rooms have very good scenic beauty and hotel is very near to local markets. Looking forward for more arrival in future and would recommend highly everyone to visit there. Thank you. We will visit soon.",Sandeep Kothiyal,/Profile/Kothiyalsandeep85,,50
