tehri-gharwal,The breath taking view of River Ganga is what makes a stay here totally worthwhile. One can hear the sound of the waves as the river enters the rapid at Shivpuri.  Every tent has a great view. The staff is very cordial and takes great care of guests.   My rafting trip was memorable for me because I had always wanted to test my comfort zone.   Overall my stay was fantastic. At this price you can not get a better deal anywhere else in Shivpuri,ekgs20,/Profile/ekgs20,"Rishikesh, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"Sometimes for the the best things in life one does not need to stay at five-star facility.   When it comes to uttarakhand, what is important is the view, the hospitality and the adventure activities.  For this Camp Magic Stone at Shivpuri, offers all the three at very reasonable prices.  The view of the Ganga river can spell-bound you for hours, as you try to count the waves as river meanders alongside Shivpuri.  I have been a regular visitor to Camp Magic Stone and it has given me new experiences every time. Would strongly recommend it to all adventure and nature lovers.",ekgs20,/Profile/ekgs20,"Rishikesh, India",50
