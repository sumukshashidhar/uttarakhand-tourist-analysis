tehri-gharwal,"Away from the hustle and bustle of the city , deep in the lush and majestic Himalayan mountains lies a village called Rampur . Thanks to a social enterprise called SaveAGram, that aims to preserve villages across India through home stays, a city slicker like me got the opportunity to spend a few days savouring the simple life.  It is just a 45 minute plane ride from the capital , New Delhi to a rural and sleepy city called Dhera Dun followed by a 2 hour car ride to Rampoor village . We were happy to breathe in the pure Himalayan air and enjoy the total lack of noise pollution compared to the capital which was the other extreme . Like most villages around the area , the entrance is an unpaved and rocky steep hill that only the physically fit would be able to climb with ease .",Arjuna Murthy,/Profile/ArjunaMurthy,"Singapore, Singapore",50

tehri-gharwal,"Tucked away amidst the scenic mountains of the Tehri Garwal region is Save A Gram, located in the village of Rampur. Being a bird photographer, I was woken up to the sounds of Paradise Flycatchers, Tree Pies, Yellow Billed Magpies, Robins, Parrots, and a wide variety of birds that took my breath away. You live the life of a Himalayan Village in its absolute full here, and your stay costs goes to the locals who open their homes and hearts to you and share their pristine surroundings. The best holiday I have ever had, minus the trappings of the 'resort' culture. You can plan long treks from here too.",kuntaldesai1961,/Profile/kuntaldesai1961,CHENNAI,50
tehri-gharwal,"Our visit to Saveagram, a small quiet village nestled in the Garhwal hills of the Great Himalayas, was far beyond what we imagined-an exhilarating experience! Cool fresh air to breathe, Clean sweet water to drink, Healthy home cooked food to eat. Add to that a spectacular view of the terraced fields amidst lush green hills, just as we step out from our cozy room!  We took a stroll around the fields and literally saw the greens we would be served, within a couple of hours-utterly delicious! The casual walk to the cave in the facing mountain turned out to be a really good hike! The Saveagram team has ensured that the rooms and bathroom are neat and clean. The drive to the village is a comfortable 2.5 hours from the Haridwar railway station as well as the Deharadun airport. The",Sujata80,/Profile/Sujata80,,50
tehri-gharwal,"At Saveagram September! Village experience in the mountains!!! Eating homegrown food, drinking Spring Water. Exercise your limbs every bit of the way. A few knocks on the head on the door! Being hosted by simple folks. Loaded by food and love and smiling Namastes. Exotic grains. Luxury of sleeping with the door open to look up to see the rafters, waking to the wet trees and chirping of birds, in the two day rain. Had it all! Mooing cows, the village woman who constantly cleaned her yard. Rain harvesting and mud thatching. I adopted the village too!!!",LalithaShivadas,/Profile/LalithaShivadas,"Kochi (Cochin), India",40
tehri-gharwal,"If you want to unwind, breathe in fresh mountain air, have freshly prepared village food, and experience great mountain treks, this place is it.  The view from the village home was awesome - surrounded by mountains dotted with tiny villages in the distance.  The 100+ year old village home I stayed in was down-to-earth but clean and tidy, and my hosts Ranjit Singh and Bimlaji took great care to ensure that my meals were prepared on time and as I wanted them.  Wake up early in the morning, and you can watch the village slowly come alive...  I suggest a minimum 2-night stay so that you'll have time to take a nice day-trek and also visit one of the local towns like Khadi or Gaja.  Plan your travel in advance with the SaveAGram folks since it'll take you 2 hrs to get to Rampur from",tjayman,/Profile/tjayman,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",50
