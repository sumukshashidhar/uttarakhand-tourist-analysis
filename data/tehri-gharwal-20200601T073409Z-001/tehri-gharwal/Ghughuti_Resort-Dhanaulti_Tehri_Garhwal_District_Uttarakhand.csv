tehri-gharwal,Beautiful property. Ghughuti never disappoints me with their services and no other hotel matches the kind of hospitality offered by them. You always spoil us with your best of the sevices and the staff at the Resort are always there to make us feel comfortable and meet our biggest to smallest requirements. Keep up the good work guys. Housekeeping staff is so well trained and ever ready to make our stay comfortable. Food that was served to us tasted like home cooked food.,skjain,/Profile/skjain001,,50

tehri-gharwal,It was an amazing and best personalised experience I ever received. The staff was extremely polite and caring. We chose ghughuti resort  to celebrate my birthday and they made every bit and every second of my day special. The rooms were neat and cleaned repeatedly time to time. Appreciate the pro-activeness of the housekeeping staff. Food was at its best as always!,himanshu gupta,/Profile/himanshuguptaa,,50

tehri-gharwal,Recently visited the place and its really awesome. The setup and everything is just amazing. Staff is very friendly and helpful. They are more than happy to meet all your demands. You have different type of options to stay from Swiss Cottages to Tree houses. Tree house number 14 has the best view as per me. The only reason I gave 3 stars is because of the food. It’s really bad and needs improvement big time. The only dish I like between the 3 meals was the Dal or the snacks. Otherwise it is definitely a 4.5 star for me. Awesome place to relax.,Ankit_agg,/Profile/Ankit_agg,"Ilford, United Kingdom",30
tehri-gharwal,"the view from room is good. food is tasty. the size of the room is very small and is difficult to adjust. bed almost covers the rooms and not much space left. the room heater provided is so small and does not heats up for comfort. the entry point is very bad , one have to climb lonf stairs to reach room.",Pranab Kumar,/Profile/pranabkumarsenroy,"Bengaluru, India",30

tehri-gharwal,"Re-View..... If I break this term I get an itch to view again what all I just passed down with.... When I turn back to view what all I just earned as my moments is the name Ghughuti Resorts...... Yes readers!!  I couldn't get down from my flashback memories of the resort.....   Team: Every successful establishment has the supporting team ahead to work..... The team here is very passionate to serve the clients with optimum and an optimistic approach.  Thanks to Mr.  Jain GM at Dhanaulti..... You reflected the real means of hospitality.....   Place: In the nature's lap, just out of your window you will see the white mountains if it's snow or else lush green view and the innerside is been made with such a thought process that you will connected...   Activities: The activities are",Aksh,/Profile/Akshitpuri,,50
tehri-gharwal,"The resort was pathetic,  we stay there for 3 nights.  The experience was very very bad.  We stay there in Swiss Cottage (actually a royal tent). We had already booked online so just checked in.  We face many problems there,  due to which I really think that it is not at all good for the family ;some of them are: *in tent,  there r fungus at some part of the clothes.  *zip of the tent was not working,  after several complaints he(manager) repair it.  When we r complaining he was saying its ok there is no danger however its a black bear prone area.  *there are 3 lanterns light in the tent,  in which 2 r not working.  *Staff was localities,  who dont know how to speak,  and some of them are smelling that u vomit as they take bath in 3-4 days.  *The water is supplied through",Ruchi,/Profile/ruchi2912,"New Delhi, India",10
tehri-gharwal,"This place is run by local kids who know nothing about hospitality. The tents are horrible, with fungus, not closed properly and exposed to the elements of nature. When it rained there was water inside the tents on the beds, one tent came apart from one side. I had a severe allergy due to the fungus and could barely breathe and needed medical help. Everyone in all 3 tents fell Sick. The food was terrible and we suffered from acute food poisoning...I can go & on. The guy running the show was oblivious to our suffering & was only interested in the money. We had to shift to another place to stay alive. Also loud blaring music and a large group of RSS workers running their gig there was the last thing you want on a vacation. Please don’t go to this lousy place & waste your money.

tehri-gharwal,"This was my 2nd stay at ghughuti resorts. The first stay (May/June 2017) was delightful and surely a great experience. Probably because of which i directly contacted the manager and booked 2 rooms (August 2018), after which the horrible experience follows. The property is very poorly maintained and the tree houses were rotten and had fungus all over around. Since we were with guests and late in night could not risk looking anywhere else for rooms. The manager agreed to change the bed sheet and pillows but still it was a horrible experience. The food was average but we had issues with the utensils some of which were not washed properly and has a rotten smell to it.",Arpit Jain,/Profile/pix_by_aj,"Dehradun, India",10
tehri-gharwal,Ghughuti is d excellent resort of this class.  New property and kept extremely clean. Mr. Naveen garg and serving staff is very friendly and welcoming. Food is too good according to available resources. Outside area of individual camp is very spacious and one of the best resort in a Dhanaulti I have experienced.,deepakbansalchamp,/Profile/deepakbansalchamp,"Faridabad District, India",50
