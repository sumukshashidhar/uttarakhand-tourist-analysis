tehri-gharwal,"While writing this review I’m still in hotel and shaking. I have booked 2 rooms one is Deluxe and another Semi Deluxe and found that both the rooms are in pathetic shape. The Trauma started from Deluxe room. I was allotted room which has gaps so I took room heater @200 per day and found that is ineffective as wind was flowing through gaps within windows and doors.  So, I made repeated requests to fix the issue and found the staff helpless. As this is a management issue workers can’t do much. So, now I have requested to downgrade myself to Semi Deluxe as it has some protection and trauma is no less here. Geyser’s doesn’t have power or they don’t work. TV’s don’t have set top boxes which were later provided. When you switch on the Tv, room light goes off. There are many rooms",Komal V,/Profile/komalv514,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",10

As usual, being a government owned property it commands the best location and handsome space available in the town. But that perhaps is just not enough.  The property has two wings- old and the new.

tehri-gharwal,As far as I know GMVN Dhanaulti has two different wings. A recent building houses rooms with rent of Rs. 5000 and 6000 throughout the year. There is no off season discount hence it's too overpriced for rains. Might be in summer and winter days during peak season it may be comfortable in terms of price for few travellers but to my percept it's still too costly on pocket. The old building houses rooms starting from Rs. 2500 and if one is traveling during rains it's also overpriced in comparison due to non availability of off season discount. There are better options available under budget. Booking is available online and at desk. Staff is least trained and experienced. Rooms are spacious with average clean and hygiene.

tehri-gharwal,"Stayed at GMVN for 2 nights... Service was pathetic.. staff, like government officials, was unprofessional, food was below average... building was old with seepage... (though a new building is under construction)... Only good point is that it is adjoining eco park... try to stay at eco huts which are just opposite of GMVN",GauravKGoyal,/Profile/GauravKGoyal,"Gurgaon, Haryana, India",20
tehri-gharwal,"Dhanaulti, at a height of 2200 mts, is an place to visit, away from the busy city life, Calm quite environment, fewer tourists, excellent scenic beauty and well maintained sight seeing invites you to this place, just an hour away from mussorie. We stayed at GMVN, Dhanaulti, which provided us with big spacious, well maintained rooms, good service and delicious food. Overall, a memorable trip",Mukul A,/Profile/Mukul16,"NewDelhi, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"Gmvn Dhanolti Heights hotel is located right on the road and adjacent to the ECO park. It is a very spacious hotel with a restaurant on the ground floor. It has neat ,big rooms with hot water availability in the bathrooms. Suffecient parking space is available for the people who stay here but the day visitors usually make it difficult. I stayed there with my wife and son during August 2012 for two nights and the monsoon rainy season had made Dhanolti very cold and extremely foggy. We felt like eating hot snacks every time and the restaurant services didn't dasappoint us though they were a bit slow. Stamina sapping Surkanda Devi temple is not very far from here but must not be missed. Last but not the least, GMVN Dhanolti Heights hotel provides a pleasent stay and is worth",Rakeshsharmandmc,/Profile/Rakeshsharmandmc,"Agra, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"I traveled to Dhanaulti with my wife during june-2011. It is a great destination for the people who like to enjoy nature in cleanest form.  The GMVN guest house is really a good option to stay as the tourists have limited option. Most of the people come here on a day visit to see the 2 ECO Parks and return back either to Mussorie or Dehradun.   GMVN is right next to the ECO park and the room in which we stayed had a good view of ECO Park from the room window. Rooms were neat and the food service was good too.(time consuming, but fine)...",Manu_Pasha,/Profile/Manu_Pasha,"Bengaluru, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"During our travel to Surkhanda devi temple we spent one night at the GMVN Dhanaulti heights. As my experience with all GMVN hotels, their location is at the best possible place. However being a government property its cheap but service and facilities wise leaves much to be desired. Anyway a new property is coming up next to the present hotel and hope that has all the desired facilities. One thing that deserves mention is the hospitability of the staff. The food was ok.",Kingshuksen,/Profile/Kingshuksen,"Kakinada, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"While travelling to Landour, Mussoorie we took a long break at Hotel Dhanaulti Heights. Dhanulti is a small quiet green village on the road connecting Mussoorie and Chamba.Tentaively, it is about 35 kilometers from Mussoorie. It has great ingredients for an attractive tourist spot: a nature-manicured deodar forest with a valley in the front and Snow-clad Mountains on the horizon. The Hotel offers excellent views of the valley and surrounding forests.The eco-park around the hill is reasonably well –maintained to allow the tourists enjoy the ethereal delicacies of sight. The climb through the deodar forest is an intimate rendezvous with nature. On reaching the top of the small hill, one has the awesome view of the far and near.

tehri-gharwal,It was a great experience touring Dhanaulti. The location of the building was beside the main road and beside one of the Eco Parks. So the location was an excellent one offering a great view of the hills and the natural beauty around. There was a huge balcony and sitting there in the sun was a great experience. The super deluxe rooms we stayed in were very good and spacious. The hotel staff were very polite and courteous. The only problem was that the room service of the hotel is only till 09:30 p.m. After that you need to go downstairs to get even drinking water. This was one problem besides the power cut which occurred during the day. But they had sufficient power back up.  But otherwise it was a great experience staying there.,Premjeeth,/Profile/Premjeeth,"Bengaluru, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"We got to Dhanaulti from Mussoorie. On arriving at our pre-booked lodge, Hotel Dhanaulti Heights, the GMVN Tourist Rest House at Dhanalti, we faced no problems at all as the members of the hotel staff were very helpful. It was a great experience staying there mostly because of the natural beauty we found ourselves surrounded by at this place. The room service at this hotel was good. There was an intercom facility, but we faced power cut during the day owing to which the intercom facility did not work then. The power cut started at about 12:30 p.m. Power supply was restored after some hours. In the evening or night there was no power cut. One of the members of the hotel staff told me they give power back up for some hours (so far as I remember from 6 p.m. to 10 or 11 p.m.) during",TravellerBibek,/Profile/TravellerBibek,"Calcutta, West Bengal, India",50
