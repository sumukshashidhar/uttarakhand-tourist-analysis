tehri-gharwal,Best Please to be with Freinds & Family. My 3rd Visit to Shivpuri and tried different Camps every time. But Sandpiper Camp is one of best.  1) Morning Breeze with complimentary Tea n Biscuit makes a great start 2) Natural Alarm - Ganga Water waves walks you with so refreshment 3) Sun Set & Sun Rise behind the mountain wins Heart 4) Food is very tasty & Hygenic.  ,Abhishek A,/Profile/AbhishekA1344,,50
tehri-gharwal,"I would summarize my review in few points:  1) The resort is at other side of river and the crossing is well below road level. so you need to walk downstream the hill and then take the boat to reach the other side. ( May. be this is the tracking which they specify as sports activitiy)  2) When you arrive you will fsee the hospitality part. After lot of ""tracking"" you may ask for glass of water but it will reach to you after 1/2 hr ( so better you dive in ganga to help your thirst)  3) During kayaking, you better do it as ""experts"" in very first time, otherwise they will kill your turn to do it. ( Note: ""you can only do it once, so dont forget to carry your ""International Kayaking License"")  4) Do not get disappointed if you are foody! It is mentioned that Non-Veg will be served.",AaB3007,/Profile/AaB3007,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",10
tehri-gharwal,"We visited the camp in april, the view and and the overall all beauti of the place is just sureal( Rishikesh overall is so beautiful) The place 30 km of rishikesh it perfect if you dont want something to crowded. it food the staff are also very helpful .

tehri-gharwal,"This was my 5th visit to Rishikesh as it is my favourite travel destination and my second stay in Beach camp. I will simply define Camp Sandpiper in its +ve and -ve:-   +ve:  1. Camp Location is really awesome. It is situated near the Sangtali Bridge. There is a lot of open area there and i think more than any other camp in Rishikesh. 2. Flexible timings: The can arrange everything as per your requirement and preferred timings. E.g. Late dinner, late rafting session.  3. Not so crowdie: there are only 25-30 Camps there hence you get enough private space to enjoy with family\friends without disturbance.  -ve:-  1. Food is BAD, really bad. Am not sure if that was occasionally as i can see some good reviews on their food. But my experience was very bad with the dinner they",PJ_Gupta,/Profile/PJ_Gupta,"Noida, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"Recently our Whole Mathematics Department of IIT Delhi got the chance to visit rishikesh and choose Campsandpiper. Awesome Food, Nice Location, everything was too great. I would recommend anyone searching for a good beach to rest campsandpiper is the choice one should make.",agmps,/Profile/agmps,"New Delhi, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"This camp is the best... I could not spend too much time here though but for next time, i wont be the part of rafting... will only relax here...  The sunbath activity would be awesome here on the banks of Ganga. Food is too good here... i dont know about veg but non-veg is super tasty...  Just one problem: The distance is bit too much from the main Rishikesh market and the the staff sitting in market office wont give you the option first of all to take their own cab instead they will ask to take a bus and it will drop you the camp. Not a good idea if your going late in the day.  i think the office ppl should volunteer to provide cabs from office to camp... even if its paid. Because that is the ultimate option 99.99% ppl take finally... so start with the same. Why to waste any",Praveen S,/Profile/praveens103,"New Delhi, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"This was my first camping experience and it was best. People here are very polite and helpful.

Very close to nature. Owner Prashant is very polite and ready to help you everytime.  So overall nice camping and rafting expeience.

tehri-gharwal,"I went with a few friends to Camp Sandpiper for the weekend at each one of us found out that we made a a perfect choice!!! Its truly amazing in many ways right from the comfortable tents, delicious food, friendly staff, exciting activities during the day to keep you busy and most important of all - the thrilling rafting experience. We went for a morning trek, swam in the water (with life jackets), did bonfire and ate such tasty food - all these activities made our day so rich and full of excitement. I would strongly recommend Sandpiper Camp to all!!",AayushJ85,/Profile/AayushJ85,"New Delhi, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"The camp site is located right by the Ganges with the moutains all around it. A very serene and beautiful surrounding. The tents were well maintained, clean and comfortable for a camp. Lots of good food was provided as well. It was a very relaxing experience being so close to nature yet with enough facilities to feel comfortable.",hwa_2013,/Profile/hwa_2013,Germany,50
tehri-gharwal,"This was my first camping experience and camp sandpiper made it a memorable one. The location (on the banks of river Ganges) with its landscape leaves you spellbound and its ambience helps you relax. You can literally spend hours sitting by the side of the river Ganges with your feet submerged in the ice cold water. The staff at the camp is very helpful and always at your service. The food, it is undoubtedly finger licking delicious. The sanitary facilities are more than good. The camps are neat and equipped with comfortable beds and a quilt that helps you get a warm sleep when the temperature gets low in the night. The lanterns provided in the night time add an ethnic look to the camp making it even more beautiful. The camp has activities such as rafting, kayaking, trekking,",Praval_zulfie,/Profile/Praval_zulfie,"Chicago, Illinois",50
tehri-gharwal,"The camp is located in a serene location between hills. To access the camp, we had to cross a river. Camp is maintained very neatly. Food facility considering the location is very good. Bathrooms and squatting pan toilets are provided with running water facilities. the tents and beds are comfortable enough. The activities provided such as rock climbing, rappelling and river rafting was awesome. All instructors were trained and you could rely on them for these activities. The overall experience was great and i would recommend this place for people seeking a nice adventure at shivpuri/byasi.",Vivek_Ganesh,/Profile/Vivek_Ganesh,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"This camp was one of the best experiences of my life. The specialty is that it is pretty isolated from the other camps and thus gives you more share of the natural beauty for you to enjoy. The services are pretty good, giving you the necessary comforts along with the whole camping experience. And yes the food is great which I didnt expect since it was a 'camp' and all. The adventure activities are good too where a guide is always there with you. This place is pretty good due to its isolation and also it entertains only a smaller number of people, so there is privacy as well.",Ankita14,/Profile/Ankita14,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"It was my first visit to Rishikesh and my main motive was rafting and it was very blissful fulfilled by camp sandpiper, the location is spell bounding and such a sceneric beauty as if painted on a canvas, the best part is the camp fire.

tehri-gharwal,"I visited Rishikesh for a couple of days with my family last month. Although I had visited Rishikesh many times during my collage days, but every time I stayed in Ashrams & hotels, but this time we decided to stay in camps and to enjoy white water rafting, as we heard a lot about it. Hence we started looking for a decent camp on Google and we found “Camp Sandpiper”. We contacted “Prashant”, the owner of the camp immediately. No doubt he is very polite and well mannered person. Many times we called him up during late evenings but he was there all the time to respond all our queries. He really tried his best to meet all our expectations.  We traveled by road from Delhi to Shivpuri. The road was in good condition, except at some places. We arrived at the place called Tapovan, from",Abhishek S,/Profile/thehimalayanmonk,New Delhi,40
