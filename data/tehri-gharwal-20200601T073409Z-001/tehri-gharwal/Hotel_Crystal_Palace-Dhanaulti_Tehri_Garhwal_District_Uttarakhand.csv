tehri-gharwal,Hotel Crystal Palace offers you an amazing view of the mountains. Very conveniently located. The rooms are big and spacious. Management and staff is very cooperative and friendly. They booked us car for visit to Mussoorie. Service and hospitality here is great. The food options and varied and delicious. They made our stay very comfortable. A must visit for every family and couple. The hotel staff will definitely make your stay at Dhanoulti memorable.,Rapti Mukherjee,/Profile/mrapti,,50
tehri-gharwal,"The first look of this hotel is slightly misleading. But once you stay there, it's truly amazing. The view from the hotel is amazing. On a clear day, you can see the snow capped Himalayas. The hotel has basic amenities but the service makes up for it. Sumeet was very helpful and tried to make our stay comfortable. The food is brilliant and totally value for money. It is walking distance from the eco park too. The only thing to note is that they give one towel per room, which is mainly due to water scarcity in the hills. Though it irritated me initially, it makes you value water more. A suggestion to the hotel would be to have now towels to prevent inconvenience.",sheetal20,/Profile/sheetal2087,"Mumbai, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"We stayed at maharaja suite of the hotel for two days on 20-22, Dec, 2018. Views from the hotel and as well as the rooms are very much fascinating, we enjoy es them much. Our Dinner and breakfast was included in the stay. Dinner was good and enjoyable but breakfast was not upto the mark, they did not provided tea or coffee in the breakfast. Their hispitality was also not good. Hotel is well built but maintained poorly, as run on lease. Dhanaulty in itself is very good to stay and to enjoy peacefulness. Location of the hotel is best as all conveyence is available right from outside. Housekeeping is worst and terrible. Would like to come again and stay in the same room but not like to dine.",AJAY KUMAR A,/Profile/AJAYKUMARA19,"Lucknow, India",40

tehri-gharwal,"We were four, stayed in Suite. Thats all was good rest was not apprehending. Blanket and bedsheets were stained and staff was not ready to change them, repeatedly gave explanations, even though when they changed , it was again dirty. We could not sleep whole night due to very cold weather and no proper blankets. No Bonfire(it was chargeable which is definately not anywhere else)  Advices Dont book Suite here not sure about executive rooms. Dont book with breakfast category as there is no buffet but just an option between two. Go for Camps here, little costlier but you will enjoy.",Pulkit G,/Profile/PulkitG64,"Noida, India",20
tehri-gharwal,"The place Dhanaulti is very beautiful. It's better to drive an extra hour from Mussorie. Every room offers great picturesque view of the mountains.We stayed on top floor which had a double bed, one sofa cum bed, a sofa and a big dining table. And a table in the balcony. The hotel staff is very nice specially Mr Semwal (Manager) and Raju who was there all the time and food is great. It's just next to Eco Camp where you can stay in tents. Overall a great experience & as mentioned earlier it's worth driving if you are planning to stay in Mussorie. It's very calm , peaceful and close to mountains. There are networks issues which made the stay more peaceful, so no internet for Jio users. The whole roads have Government hand pumps providing cool himalaya water . These pumps are almost",Hemant8197,/Profile/Hemant8197,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",50
tehri-gharwal," I visited the Dhanaulti recently in May 2017 and stayed for 2 Nights in deluxe room in Hotel Crystal Palace. it's a very calm place and view from hotel is very good. it is the first Hotel when you enter to the Dhanaulti. They have a parking for four wheelers and up to four vehicle can park in the shade. Rooms are big enough and situated in 3 floors ; 1st and 3rd floor are having terrace with huts, where you can sit and enjoy your snacks meal by watching valley and mountain. 3rd floor is having the Suite; which is basically family room; so if you have grown up kid, you can stay in that one.  No lift is available so be careful while choosing your room if you are travelling with elderly person. They have their own kitchen and the food quality is good. Staff is cooperative and they",THK786,/Profile/THK786,"Faridabad, India",40
