tehri-gharwal,Stayed here for a week before the lockdown throughout India. Decided to remain in India and luckily the hotel remained open. They were very welcoming and took good care of me throughout the time even though I was the only guest in the hotel. The hospitality is second to none.,Nash,/Profile/nash704,,50

tehri-gharwal,Saw reviews that this was a good upmarket budget hotel. Stayed there for one night. Paid a very high price for big room which had a mouse and generally unclean. Staff were friendly with mouse issue and I was immediately moved to another room but it came into that room as well. Overall wouldnâ€™t recommend as not worth the price.,Ash,/Profile/ashnil_13,Uk,20
tehri-gharwal,"Being in the centre of the city. This hotel is a blessing for all those who are looking for good service at a reasonable price. They have an absolute friendly and co operative staff who made sure we were comfortable, being a group of 7 girls. The hotel is clean and feels very comfortable.  The food at this hotel is unbelievable. We did not expect to find such food in Rishikesh. But thanks to peepal tree they gave us an absolute amazing breakfast, aloo paratha, chole bature and Puri sagu to name a few. With dinner in mind, their bruchetta is a must try and the sabzi roti and rice all were too yumm. Last but not the least. The hotel on our demand and keeping the weather in mind gave us some mouth watering aloo and pyaaz ke pakore which I can't forget. This was my few experiences",Suman Jain,/Profile/sumanj501,,50
tehri-gharwal,A decent hotel currently under renovation & expansion to include a bakery is located at the center of Tapovan which is in a center to go to Rishikesh  Haridwar or BadriKedar. Triveni ghat is nearby. Although we didn't try the restaurant many eateries are nearby. Clean rooms with cooperative staff adds to the spacious rooms. Overall a good place to stay...,DRPRPANDIT,/Profile/DRPRPANDIT,"Mumbai, India",40

tehri-gharwal,"Had to park my car under a construction site behind the hotel. The room was stinky because of the leakages in the shaft may be or may be it was sewer. This had a smell of a septic tank which I realized in the middle of the night and couldn't do much about it. Was just for a night and things were just average, Location was close to everything. Its a small time budget hotel.",stanzinc2018,/Profile/stanzinc2018,,20

tehri-gharwal,"Hotel Peepal Tree is situated in the middle of Town and approachable. Rooms were over charged with type of facilities. Roof Top Restaurant is pathetic. Avoid dining there.. Go out for meals and try local food. Dhabas serve hygienic food. Do not eat from road side stalls. carry drinking water.  Go for White water rafting, trekking and River Bank side walks. Lot of negotiations. Use local transport. Pay by card and adk for Bills. ",colonelBheem,/Profile/colonelBheem,"Indore, India",30

tehri-gharwal,"Don't..! Don't..! Don't..! ever stay in this hotel . Very poor service, very irresponsible staff especially MANAGER.  Gyser in our room caught fire and they didn't even have working fire extinguisher available in premesis . Staff was not even aware of handling electric fire they were throwing water on it ..??? Later on when the fire was extinguished and when questioned about availability and uses of extinguisher, the staff mainly Manager started misbehaving with us . Even the owners of hotel were not listening about the irresponsiblities , faults and misbehavior of their workers. Finally with the help of local police we managed to find and shift to another hotel HOLLY RIVER  which was very good and co-operative ..in the middle of night.",RACHNAVIKAS G,/Profile/RACHNAVIKASG,,10
tehri-gharwal,"We stayed here for two nights before proceeding to Badrinath. The hotel is a new one (one and half year old hotel) and is a sister hotel of Kunwar Residency. The experience right from the time of booking has been very good, with Mr.Arun (owner) and Piyush (Manager) advising us to go for this hotel as we had Senior Citizens in the group and Kunwar Residency does not have a lift.   The rooms are very clean and spacious,with comfortable bed and with clean toilets. Some rooms have a balcony providing a view of Ganga/Rishikesh. Their roof top restaurant is well managed by an enthusiastic team that serves nice food. The menu is North Indian and World Cuisine mostly. You can enjoy Rishikesh view while having dinner. It's on the Badrinath highway at Tapovan auto stand and Lakhman Jhula",RamaKDV,/Profile/RamaKDV,"Hyderabad, India",50
