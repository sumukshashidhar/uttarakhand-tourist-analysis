tehri-gharwal,"Amazing place in the lap of untouched nature. Sunrise turns the water in different shades of colour. When you sit quietly you hear the sounds of different birds, no noise of traffic it is so peaceful.",Aish272,/Profile/Aish272,Kolkatta,40

tehri-gharwal,GMVN Guest House of New Tehri ....not up to the mark...accommodation and service both ...lots of scope to improve ...typical govt. mentality ...linens were stinky ...towels  and toiletries not given ..they can always improve everything or introduce few deluxe rooms to cater to different class of tourists ,AnupaSud,/Profile/AnupaSud,"Pune, India",20
tehri-gharwal,"The room, where I stayed had the roof terrace in front  and that gave good view of the mountain. The hotel is centrally located and the tariff is reasonable. The service is ok and the food is good. Recommended for one/two day stay.",ddebabrata2016,/Profile/ddebabrata2016,"Ghaziabad, India",40
tehri-gharwal,The rooms are very shabby and totally unmanaged.  There was bad smell from the bathrooms.    family room which we had booked were just in front of store room.  Location of the hotel is fine but we found it to be more unhygenic to stay.  Please avoid if travelling with family.,GoaChennai,/Profile/GoaChennai,Chennai,10
tehri-gharwal,To explore tehri dam and surrounding it can be best place. Situated on hilly side which offers some good views. It has got decent sized rooms and some of them got balcony attached so it makes stay even more memorable.   To explore India's largest Hydro project and surrounding recreational area this can be a safe choice without a doubt due to proximity and government run management.   They have got restaurant also which offers some good option in veg food.  Apart from decent sized rooms even bathrooms are bit large and clean. Bed and linen was comfortable too.  Service can be slow sometimes.  Tariffs are quite reasonable too.,Manandani,/Profile/Manandani,"Mumbai, India",40
tehri-gharwal,Nothing special abt the stay... Only good thing is the terrace balcony. Every morning at 4 u will hear Burbani from near abt gurdwara. Very homely food at restaurant. Staff not helpful. Centrally located at  New Tehri Town,Delhi Wala,/Profile/DelhiWala17,,30
tehri-gharwal,First thing the picture of the New Tehri GMVN Guest house should be changed as current picture is not correct.  The Guest is located at one of town circle and it has a view of two sides of mountains. Nice place to be. One of the problem is the multiple steps it has to reach the room. It is a issue for old people travelling along.  The rooms are not great bur never the less it has full utility for the money paid. Not a good place for great options at Menu card.  Staff is supportive to the limitation they have.  Over all a better experiance.,RiteshKumarGupta,/Profile/RiteshKumarGupta,"Noida, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"Visited Tehri dam during recent char dham yatra. Beautiful dam & huge hydro dam...traveling along the old route( not new NH) was awesome, with upclose views of Tehri backwaters...stay at GMVN Guest house was pleasant.. Strongly recommend a visit to new Tehri..",Rajeevlochanam,/Profile/Rajeevlochanam,,50
tehri-gharwal,Like all govt place this place has laid back attitude. It is clean and well kept though. We had to stay as visiting a family fried function in Chamba. Tehri lake is good and inviting. We enjoyed boating and had good homely lunch in a road side restaurant. Rishikesh has better hotels to stay....,singh3singh,/Profile/singh3singh,,40
tehri-gharwal,The place is a modern building which is neat and clean and large spacious rooms. Excellent value for money with a decent restaurant.   The location is on the main Tehri Chamba road.   The menu options in the restaurant are limited but they provide fresh food.,PiyushDEL,/Profile/PiyushDEL,Bangalore,40
