tehri-gharwal,The scope of discovering the many hidden secrets of Nature in a fun-filled environment makes trekking no less than a crash course in Nature. At Nagtibba Base Camp (6000 feet) we make trekking as an activity that challenges the physical as well as the mental aspects of an adventure fanatic. This adventure activity will offer an amazing adrenaline rush and you will be really surprised to know that trekking also leads to some permanent benefits.
