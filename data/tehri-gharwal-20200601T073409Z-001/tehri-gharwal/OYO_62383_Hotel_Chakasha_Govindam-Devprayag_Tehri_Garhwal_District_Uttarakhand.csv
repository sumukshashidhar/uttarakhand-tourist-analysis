tehri-gharwal,We took a one night halt in this hotel while Badrinath visit. We booked family double bed room online. The room was big but cleanness department needs improvement. The food was too average. But I believe this is best we can get in this route. ,Rishikesh,/Profile/RishikeshP31,"Greater Noida, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"This is convenient place for overnight stay if you are planning Chardham on your own. The dinner served was excellent with unique Chur Chur Paratha. However, on our way back the food served was below average. A/c rooms are BACK SIDE(Recommended) Front side rooms, lots of noise as its next to highway. ",Atul J,/Profile/AtulJ285,,40

tehri-gharwal,"We did marriage function at Chakasa Govindam on 3rd & 4th Dec' 17. Location is  awesome, felt home like atmosphere with warm and cordial hospitality of hotel staff. Special thanks to KUDIYAL JEE (Owner), his personal intervention to greet the guest and managing all bits & pieces with his team players was much appreciable. It is located in bank of GANGA and surrounded with lush green forest in NH58 (Rishkesh - Badrinath HW).",Rukam R,/Profile/RukamR,,50
tehri-gharwal,We stayed there for a night on our way to Delhi from Badrinath. Room is spacious and view is also good. Wide options available for food. Staff was co-operative. Parking is available. Room rates are pretty reasonable.,Adv.SiddharthVerma,/Profile/AdvSiddharthVerma,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"It is right on the Badrinath highway with rooms right above the restaurant. The view from the room I stayed was fantastic. The staff are very helpful and bring up food to your room if you inform them. The TV is great and clarity is something that I have not even seen abroad. Now for the cons. The food is oily, you hardly get any hot water and the bed is a mattress on springs. There is no way two people can lie down and sleep in peace without disturbing each other.",Divya7,/Profile/Divya7,"Chennai, India",30
tehri-gharwal,Pros:  1) Good AC rooms with Ganga flowing at the back.  2) Very helpful and hospitable staff specially the owner. 3) Amazing food. 4) very near to the alakhnanda and bhagirathi sangam (amazing place to sit and meditate)   Cons: Nothing bad about the hotel it's just that the place has nothing much to offer except one mandir at sangam.,Amandeep Singh,/Profile/896amandeeps,"Chandigarh, India",40
tehri-gharwal,This hotel is situated on the main highway. The view from the room of the Ganga flowing through the mountains downstream. If you are an avid birdwatcher you can spend a good time looking outside the window because you can see some very beautiful birds early morning.   Cleanliness wise the rooms are clean but it is not necessary that the sheets might be changed. So check and get them changed in front of you. Also hot water was not available but since it was quite hot in Devprayag that day we managed.   Food is decent. They offer breakfast very late after 8:30pm. Many of the dishes on the menu are generally not available.  Overall ok for a stopover at night if you are passing through Devprayag. ,Neha B,/Profile/416nehab,,30
tehri-gharwal,"The stay in the hotel was very peaceful and rooms were also neat and clean with full amenities in it , there was no problem regarding room service as well , they were available at one call , food was also good",Poonam S,/Profile/PoonamS950,,40
tehri-gharwal,We were travelling to Chopta from Haridwar and selected this hotel to stay during transit. Location of the hotel is few KM before (if you arrive from Haridwar) the place where Alaknanda and Bhagirathi rivers meet and take the name Ganga. Its located on the Main Badrinath Highway and car parking available.  Staffs were very helpful and food was really good in reasonable price. View from the rooms and the dining room is excellent. Round the clock running hot water and large size rooms with big bathroom would make you happy.  We had booked 2 rooms for a single night. In one room we had faced problem insects in bed but after reporting to the staffs they had taken care the issue and changed the bed linen.,Tirtha Chatterjee,/Profile/tirthachatterjee,"Kolkata, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"My parents stayed at Chaksha Govinda on the way from Badrinath. It is just another hotel, right on the road, convenient to stay overnight but not the most appealing choice. There is a lot to be desired from the hotel on cleanliness. ",kpx123,/Profile/kpx123,"Dublin, Ireland",30
tehri-gharwal,"On our way to Joshimath we stopped by Chakasa Govindam as the drive from Delhi was quite long. We had booked the hotel after reading the reviews from tripadvisor. Though the drive from delhi could be very long but it is always advisable to go further down few kms and stop in rudraprayag than in these mid way hotels. Ours was a night halt therefore somehow we managed. The rooms shown in the pic are very small and not up to the standard.The first thing we had to request the staff is to change the bed sheets and pillow covers, ""this was despite our information to the staff about our arrival well in advance"", there was no backup for the power failure, the food was very average though I can understand finding such hotels with basic comforts in such region is difficult but I don't",AjayVenkatesh,/Profile/AjayVenkatesh,"Mumbai, India",30
tehri-gharwal,This was our second hault to Auli from Malegaon. Night stay was peaceful with proper air-conditioning. Food quality was good. Rooms are very congested. Bathrooms are very long and without proper ventilation. Amneties are not so good. Stairs and overall hotel is not so clean. But keeping in mind the difficult location of the hotel its good choice for one night stay. ,vrushal1980,/Profile/vrushal1980,"Pune, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"Our purpose of staying in this Hotel, was to be close to the River Junction so we could scatter my mother-in-laws ashes into the rivers junction. The staff here were very accommodating, the rooms were quite spacious neat & clean & plenty of hot water. (The bathroom was huge) The bedroom had extra bed blankets..very snuggly, as it was very cold up there! OMG!!! the meals were wholesome & very tasty, cooked as needed. All 4 We were very happy to stay here in two rooms. We also had hot sweet Chai when we needed it. An awesome view of the Holy Ganga from our room.we'll definitely staw again if the need arises.

tehri-gharwal,"Its pretty hard to find such good hotels in that region. The hotel offers comfort, satisfaction, value for money (that's the real thing at the end of the day) and much more.  The food is really amazing and so are the rooms..  It is a ""Complete Satisfaction Guaranteed"" type of a deal...",Vaibhav K,/Profile/789vaibhavk,,50
tehri-gharwal,"Good Stay in Hotel Chakasha Govindam offers simple classic accommodation in Devaprayag. The property is 300 metres from Devaprayag Ganga Sangam, while the Raghunathji Temple is 2.5 km away. Courteous staff. The hotel serves  good food.
