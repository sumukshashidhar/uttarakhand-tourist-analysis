tehri-gharwal,"It was a wonderful stay with nature's true color. I went to Camp Awara in Dec-2018 on an office trip. The best view was sunrise. It was a magical moment to see the color of Himalaya when the first sunlight was about to fall on.  - Breakfast to dinner, was delicious(Veg+Non-veg) - There are 4-5 internal activity you could do here. - Evening snacks were served with high volume music system and you can also have bonfire night. - Staff was friendly and the service was awesome.  With all these points and the moment we had there, made my trip fabulous. Thank you Camp Awara.",Vivek Ranjan,/Profile/ivivekranjan,,50
tehri-gharwal,"Awesome place to enjoy and relax in hills with friends. Yummy food and good service.It is one of the best place to experience nature. It is peaceful, clean, natural and very good place for spending a weekend. This is far best thing which I ever experienced in a hotel/camp.",Ashish verma,/Profile/yashashishverma,,50

tehri-gharwal,"We recently traveled to Dhanaulti and stayed at Camp Awara over the Weekend. Check-in was very smooth without much hassle (just to add we were there around 6:15am and we were provided our camps very promptly). Overall stay was quite comfortable, the camps which we were provided was adequate in space with comfortable bedding and attached washroom. Washroom was clean and they even provided hot water.  Good things - View from the camps was awesome, you get to see snow claded Himalayan ranges  - Gives you real sense of camping - You don't need to go anywhere, they provide adventure activities in the camp itself - Extra points to staff who was very friendly and helpful. - The breakfast and food was very tasty with adequate variety. - Bonfire arrangement with Music and Snacks  Overall",Nishant Nigam,/Profile/nigamnishant,,50
tehri-gharwal,"It was a nice stay here on camp awara, I enjoyed the sight seeing from the camp. One can see great Himalaya covered with snow, and when the first light drops on the ice it turns into gold. This view was awesome for me. There are 5-6 activities there within the camp that one can enjoy. Person at camp awara are cooperative while you need any kind of help. The food was good and within the budget.  After all it was a fantastic experience visiting CAMP AWARA!",Vijay,/Profile/vijaytestpy,,50
tehri-gharwal,"Camp is not in same level of road, everyone needs to get down and up atleast 600 feet with a steep, non maintained, sleepy trek. Trek route has very little of no stair.  Pros: 1. very good view 2. Night party 3. Very nice food 4. Good behavior of stuffs    Cons: 1. Steep trek with little or no stair  2. Poor tents  3. Poor beds inside",Tanmoy B,/Profile/tanmoyb697,"Kolkata, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"We were group of 10 people, We have planned this in off season, month of July,  But feel lots of advantage of off season,  Location wise camp is gud, safety and security was OK, CCTV is available for monitoring,  No liquor allow in common place.so OK for families.. but don't be much reliable. Camp is camp.  Adventurous activities are available in good conditions  Food quality is good  Staff behaviour is good  Good place for fun also for Peace  Camp quality is not very good..ok-ok  Bad/bistar was smelly ..  Advice:carry one bad sheet and one plow cover ,  Value of money stay.",Crazycub,/Profile/Crazycub,"Bhopal, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"Camp Awara was a great weekend getaway for us. The staffs were very courteous and it was a pleasant stay. If you wish to spend a lazy weekend surrounded by beautiful views and a DJ evening party outside your cottage , it is a perfect stay",Deepjyoti A,/Profile/DeepjyotiA1,,50
tehri-gharwal,"We have visited with our family and friends to this camp, really pathatic place to visit, no hygiene factor being considered in order to make it. I would not recommend to anyone. Owners must work on their outlet to run it succesfully. Thiugh its good location, they need to work on the quality of matteress, washrooms in tents and tent quality and space between tents. currently its like refugee way of living for guests.",rohit m,/Profile/453rohitm,,20
tehri-gharwal,"I have stayed in a camp multiple times and yes you do have to compromise on certain things since camps cannot give you the comfort of a luxury hotel. guess what ""CAMP AWARA"" turned out to be so bloody terrible that i didn't stay there for even one night. The tents are so small that if you move to your left or right you may land into the washroom or on the floor. They have got three beds in a tent so you can imagine how cramped the position would be. Moreover the place is very untidy with litter all around.  Washroom : - :D there is no such thing as washroom. its a corner that you get besides your tent as if you are staying in jail and yes that foul smell it still lingers in my brain.",ZAPPER Zapped 👽,/Profile/ZAPPER993,"Ghaziabad, India",20
tehri-gharwal,We stayed here on Feb-2017. It was fantastic trip with a comfortable stay.  The adventure activities and food was superb.  the DJ night in the night was wonderful. I strongly recommend this if you are looking an Enjoyable trip near to Delhi,Rajat K,/Profile/RajatK379,,50
tehri-gharwal,"To start with, the travel from Delhi to Dhanaulti has become a challenge in itself with all the traffic jams at regular intervals. A journey which typically should take about 7-8hrs now takes around 12 hours due to heavy congestion throughout the way. But, one’s love for nature and the feel good factor in staying close to nature keeps you charged and motivated. We were a group of 15-7 adults and 8 kids- all regular travelers to offbeat location. Since our trip was planned at the last minute so we decided to go to a nearby place only and our final choice was Dhanaulti. Since this wasn’t my first visit to Dhanaulti and I was confident that this would definitely be ‘our’ kind of destination offering a welcome break and some beautiful memories to cherish. Due to last minute planning",VeryVikram,/Profile/VeryVikram,"New Delhi, India",10
tehri-gharwal,Place is really beautiful and scenic however the kind of services and food the camp provided was pathetic. They were least interested in providing food and they did not provided what they promised. Bedding were also not clean. Please choose some hotel over this camp.,Gayitrispeaks,/Profile/Gayitrispeaks,"Faridabad, India",20
tehri-gharwal,Don't waste you money and time guys. Three reason not to be there.   First there is lack of space you have no private place to site or relax every thing is common for each camp.   Second they do common bornfire for 2hr!!!! you drove around 7-9 hours and to spend your time under sky in winter and they give you 2hr for that   Third There is no water after asking so many time we have only one option to leave this camp.,Naman R,/Profile/71namanr,,10
tehri-gharwal,"I had stayed in September 2016 with my friends. Clean tent and clean toilets. Food was simply awesome and helping staff. We have requested for music and they have arranged a music for us.    I'll recommend Awara Camp to everyone,",Abhishek S,/Profile/abhisheks291,,40
tehri-gharwal,"I have visited to Camp awara in the month August, 2016. I thought that it will be a good camp as the picture has shown on their Website. But unfortunate the Bed was so dirty and the pillow cover so dirty and it was smelling. There was a big problem of Toilet because the toilet was not so cleaned and water problem was also a big problem there. The staff was not co-operative. And most worst thing that the food was not tasty. It was like that they boiled the foods and server in front of us.  The one positive thing i was seen over there that the location was too good. You have given us a bitter experience.",DEMONDEVILAJ,/Profile/DEMONDEVILAJ,"Varanasi, India",10
tehri-gharwal,This property is value for money in dhanaulti.  If you like camping and dont want a luxury this is the place for you.  Tents are well maintained & food is really good.  Good place to hangout with your friends or with family,Surinder O,/Profile/SurinderO,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,This property has got an amazing view & Actually value for money.  Go in a group & you will enjoy this property.  There are so  any in house activities across all the age groups.  Food is also nice & you get bonfire in the night,prerna81,/Profile/prerna81,"New Delhi, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"pros - location and weather  cons - overvalued charges, unhygienic food, poor service, unorganized events, room cleanness and lack of water. Overall my experience was average due to over valued price and unhygienic food.  ",tez_sachin,/Profile/tez_sachin,"New Delhi, India",30
tehri-gharwal,I went to Camp Awara with my friends. It is an overnight journey from Delhi. This place has a nice scenery view. They maintained it pretty well as the name sounds. Tents are good along with attached washroom. Staffs are helpful. They served food also which is pretty good. I went to this place in the month of September and really loved this place in that cold with beautiful mountain view and having bonfire with starters. They provide some camping activities. I will highly recommend this place to everyone.,Rohit_iitkgp,/Profile/Rohit_iitkgp,"Bengaluru, India",40

tehri-gharwal,"This place is like heaven. I had not planned anything while coming to Dhanaulti, and randomly came across this place on the Internet search, and I don't regret doing that. What a chance of luck it was to find such a gem, out of nowhere in the middle of a small village. This Camp retreat is set on a few distance down the hill ( a bit of walk down the road toward the hills ). This place has one of the best breathtaking views I have ever come across on my travel to Uttarakhand.   The tents are very comfortable, and the staff and the owner of the place are very efficient to take care of all your needs. I stayed here for 3 days and never ever saw this place empty, as there were visitors willing to get a place on this camping site back to back. At a time this place can accommodate",Ashwini K,/Profile/Ashwinikapoor,"Noida, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"I along with office colleagues stayed in this camp on 2nd October 2015. The camp activities are good, food is average, music system needs replacement, staff is cooperative, tents are old, less moving space inside the tents.  No Car Parking provided by Camp organizers. Improvement on food and other petty things are required.",Sharad-1965,/Profile/Sharad-1965,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"Please don't mistake the place as a luxury. The accomodation is basic tented one with attached toilets. Food is okay..staff is very cooperative.  No place for parking the vehicles as this place is approximately 500 meters down the hill from the road.  You will have fun with the fun activities like fire fox, burma bridge etc.  A must have experience for everyone but not a place for family vacation.",Kuldeep A,/Profile/884kuldeepa,"Faridabad, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"it was an average experience not so good reasons for this was the Tents which where very small not same as it looks in the picure(deluxe), room service was slow , distance from the main road was very tiring, but it was easy to locate the place.",Jagmohan_Bisht,/Profile/Jagmohan_Bisht,"New Delhi, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"Nice location - it is quite close to the “Eco Park” in Dhanolti, very close to the roadhead and yet is in the lap of nature away from the sound of traffic in a peaceful setting and offers nice views. Camps are Ok, nothing luxurious about them but no one expect luxury in such camps. Nice comfortable camps with attached toilet and running water. The camps for 04-05 are quite spacious with larger toilet area. No room service ofcourse. Once has to go up to the Dining camp for the meals and morning/evening tea. I am a vegetarian and I found the food at the camps nice and simple. The light adventure activities in the camp set the tone of our holidays and it was fun to indulge in those activities (Flying Fox, Burma Bridge, Valley crossing etc.).   The instructor and in a way overall",Sandeep_Raturi,/Profile/Sandeep_Raturi,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"Camp AWARA in Dhanualti has poor management of Camp, Service is poor, meals are always late. Place they have chosen to place the camp is not easily accessible from the road. Not at all recommended for families with kids and parents. Poor food quality, loud music even during nights were encouraged. Overall very terrible experience.",syewlekar,/Profile/syewlekar,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",10

tehri-gharwal,We had 6 family members went last week to camp awara in Dhanaulti. The location of campsite is awesome. It is easily accessible from state highway and Dhanaulti Eco-park. Food was nicely prepared and very testy. All staffs are dedicated to serve you on your stay in a professional manner. Rope based activities have really thrilled us. Tents are cleaned and seems hygenic. Sunrise view in morning is very nice. Overall it was truly incredible experience of camping with my family members.,Somayadtt,/Profile/Somayadtt,"Kolkata, India",40
tehri-gharwal,We had gone as group of 3 families. We foun it as much terrible as we had decided to stop here for 2 days and get out of it by 2 hours. In it you have to go very very down to enter it and for food you have to go up and the way is verry slippery and made of sand.,Dhruv g,/Profile/822dhruvg,,10
