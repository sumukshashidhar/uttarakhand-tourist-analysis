tehri-gharwal,Save your time and money. Take your business somewhere else.   The rooms leave a lot to desire. We were charged for an AC that never worked. The water in the room was not warm. When we pointed out to the staff ~ they dismissed it saying it’s hot...  Overall ~ not recommended to stay in this place. ,kua3ek,/Profile/kua3ek,"Lublin, Poland",10
tehri-gharwal,"Stayed here for 4 nights and really loved it. Great location, amazing view from terrace. And as for the “shabby dog” that someone has wrote about, his name is sharoo and he is beautiful. If you don’t like dogs then don’t stay here because sharoo always comes on the terrace and there’s also another nice dog who sleeps there too. And the house next door does hang their washing on the rails but they are just a nice little family living their lives and the kids are cute! Staff really friendly and gave us late checkout free of charge when we had to get a night train. It’s up to you to ask for new towels etc and our room didn’t get cleaned once in the 4 days we were there but we’re travelling and to be honest, don’t really care! Overall we enjoyed our stay here and would definitely",Rosie H,/Profile/4rosieh,"Manchester, United Kingdom",50
tehri-gharwal,"Superb view from Room, Enjoyed journey at Rishikesh, it would be a great experience to be near to Laxman joola. Fare from railway station to grace ganga hotel is 200. Local guide available at 150rs. Cons food not available as no restaurant and no lift. Mr.Vikash is professional manager to handle all kind of situation, staff Karan, Abhay is too humble to guide and polite to do work.",Jv1,/Profile/jvshah111,"Mandvi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"The hotel is nothing that it is shown in pictures. It looks like unfinished construction. I did my booking from booking.com and they sent me and the hotel sent me an email for online checkin form stating to avoid line while checkin. But I had my doubts about the room that I have booked and the one they have mentioned in booking. So I called and I was advised not to worry . Upon reaching the guy on the reception advised me to cancel my booking from booking.com as that is for non AC ,I don't remember I opted for non AC in this hot weather but I did believing he will do the new booking for us. They offered terrace room with balcony view. Which is nothing but  view of mountain but also the rushed streets, and on the right again an unfinished construction and their clothes drying.

tehri-gharwal,"First and foremost reason of giving 1 star is because I cannot give less than this. I did my booking through booking.com and the room which I booked was given to someone else already. Rooms which were offered to me didn't have a window and TV. One of the room looked as if was converted from a servant quarter. Staff was not at all helpful and even asked me to go to some other hotel at 6 in the evening. My bad luck I had to stay on the 5th floor with my parents and no lift. There is just one helping staff who helps check in, cook food and do all other things. My suggestion to the hotel owner, if you can't fulfill your obligations then stop listing your hotel on any of the sites.",Ankit C,/Profile/AnkitC959,"Noida, India",10
tehri-gharwal,"To start the hotel is not finished. The walls were not painted and inside the room was full of moisture. We paid for a room with TV and wifi and it didn't have TV (the personal told us it would bring a TV and it never did thought we stayed for 3 days) and the wifi was available only at night. The window of the bathroom was not finished so there was a hole to the exterior and it was freezing inside. The breakfast included was only a triangle of sandwich and tea, but since the hotel is half-done you have to eat it on your room. For the price one is paying you are being robbed. A hostel has the same and it's cheaper. ",McManny22,/Profile/McManny22,,10
tehri-gharwal,This hotel is really clean and located in the centre. It is only 5 minutes walk to the famous bridge. It has an awesome terrace  from which you can enjoy an incredible view and also delicious breakfast which can be served there. ,Lenka L,/Profile/897lenkal,,50
tehri-gharwal,"Hotel Grace Ganga is an epitome of what you may call ""Atithi Devo Bhava""  Let me start why I think this hotel is one of the best hotels that Iv visited in recent times:-  1. The hotel manager and the hotel owner -Jag Mohan are absolutely wonderful human beings. Me and my partner were totally in awe of them and were overwhelmed and overjoyed by the hospitality that they extended.   2. The entire staff is very friendly and helpful. I can't forget how they dropped us to the bus stand n even otherwise assisted us on smaller occasions.  3. We simply loved the T-4 room in which we stayed.  The room was a delight. Fully equipped with modern state of the art facilitates and amenities,  the room overlook the lush green mountains covered with floting clouds and the scenec, serene beauty",diya1510,/Profile/diya1510,"New Delhi, India",50
