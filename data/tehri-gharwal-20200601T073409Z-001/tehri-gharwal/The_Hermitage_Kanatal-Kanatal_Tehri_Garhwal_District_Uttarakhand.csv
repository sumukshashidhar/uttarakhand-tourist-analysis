tehri-gharwal,It is a small and homely hotel resort run by Suman Bhatia and her team. The ambience is beautiful you are into the lap of Shivalik hills. I am thankful and grateful to Mr akhilesh and moni who went out of the way to make us comfortable. The chef mahendra ji use to come and ask for food requirements. The bonfire lit at night made our day as we used to sit beside it and watch the open sky and twinkling stars. And the freezing cold with a glass of old monk. Wow what a pleasant way to spend your vacation in a quiet hill station. Which is just 3 hrs away from Dehradun.,Haresh K,/Profile/hareshkundnani,"Mumbai, India",40

tehri-gharwal,"It was an adhoc plan with friends to go out of hustle of delhi and spend a day in hills but not very far. As Mussoorie and its nearby places are always crowded, so we plan for Kanatal which is a little distant from Mussoorie about 30kms on dhanulti road. So we didnt do any prior booking and plan to first check property then will decide, as a backup we plan to go to mussoorie, if nothing works out.  It was a good 7 hrs drive from delhi and took chamba route to Kanatal. Its was very small place on the highway, if you dont look out, you might miss it on the way.   We saw this hotel on the way and plan to check out. From outside its look like any hill house but when you go inside you will see all basic facilities for a comfortable stay.

Being a Club Member, we decided on booking at the resort in Kanatal. We managed to get only 3 rooms there. Since we were 14 people in all, we searched the Net and came across an interesting property called ""The Hermitage"".  Surely it turned out to be the right choice. Located 40 kms east of Mussoorie, it is located on top of a narrow ridge, giving an all round view of mountains and forests.

A little play area with table tennis and other games, along with books were small details that added to the experience.

Well about our stay at 'The Hermitage', i have mixed feelings and that's why i rated this property as Average. I'll be very honest about my review and just mention all the good and probably 'things to improve' things that we observed.  First the good points:  - Owners : Suman ji & Mr. Bhatia are very cordial and engage with their guests very well.   - Staff : Though does not seems to be professionally trained, but well versed and prompt to all your needs, staff have been very helpful.  - Location: The property is on road in kanataal and easily accessible from Chamba & Dhanaulti.  - Parking:",Vishal Garg,/Profile/VishalGarg652,"Faridabad, India",30

However we had some issues that has made me rate the place lesser:  1-The power supply to our room was very patchy and so the heater & geyser kept going off. Infact had to stay one whole night without heating at sub zero temperature!  2- The geyser didnt work too well. Water was too hot or too cold most of the time & the geyser was leaking which the staff fixed for us on day 2. 3 - The restaurant & room dining menu was good and food decent but quite exorbitantly priced!,Neha M,/Profile/NehaMisraM,,30
tehri-gharwal,After you enter Kanatal/Dhanaulti this is one of the most prominent hotel so its not easy to miss. Rooms are good and the staff is okay. However the price for a room incl taxes is 6500 which is too much IMO. You can get Taj in Hyderabad at this price :) It makes sense to move a km further and look for other options at a fraction of price because in such scenic environment you don't want to stay inside your room/hotel where there is no view or balcony.

tehri-gharwal,Location wise its on the main road so there will no difficulty to reach it. It has its own cafeteria/restaurants so you can order whenever you want. There are only few places to stay available at Kanatal so I would recommend this hotel because its hassle free  whereas other cottages don't have a proper restaurant. Staffs are well behaved  and owners are really helpful and they try to make your stay comfortable. Wifi might be problem but you dont need it while you enjoy nature . Rooms are small in case three adults are staying in a same. Not so luxurious place but a comfortable stay. Dont order any continental food at restaurant not so good. For driver they dont have any arrangement for their boarding but there are places  available nearby charging Rs 50 to Rs100.,Saptak S,/Profile/SaptakS3,,50
tehri-gharwal,"Kanatal is a gem hidden away in Garhwal hills not too far from Delhi, hardly 325 Kms away. Best part is the altitude is highest among hill stations around Delhi, Manali included. So even in peak summers it is gently cold, and at time very cold, during nights. But don't go if it's the crowds, ice cream parlours and the mall roads that you dig. Kanatal has very few hotels and a lot of camping sites. Hermitage is one of the oldest establishments here, run by Suman and Les Bhatia. The warm personal touch of the owners in running the place is what makes it stand out. Location is perfect, bang on the ridge giving best views on both sides.

They have very strict rules of the hotel, such no complaints and music cann't be played after 11.00 or something, as the rooms are confined in kind of a close corridor. Try booking rooms on the ground floor or lower ground, I think those are better.. though I am not sure about it.. Wi-Fi was an available amenity but it wasn't working.

But pretty strategically located near Dehradun and Mussourie. A place where you can enjoy the Himalayas away from all the hustle bustle.  It has 2 pretty big name resorts there: Carlton and Mahindras.  So if you are a walk-in and are going to judge your hotel by it's looks, you will probably miss The Hermitage completely.

tehri-gharwal,The resort is a relaxed getaway in the middle of hills about 2-3 hrs away from dehradun. It is a quiet place and has few rooms. The staff is very courteous and the food is good. There are a few beautiful treks close to the resort that you can explore during your stay here. It was windy and cold in the evenings even during peak summer although the afternoons were warm. There is a nice coffee house and an open verandah where you can enjoy your tea or a bonfire that the owners will gladly put on your request.

One of the best things that you experience at this place is the warm and friendly hospitality of the owners of this resort when Ms Suman was present right at the gate to receive us. Its a very small resort with around 6-8 rooms on 2 floors and our team occupied the entire resort except one more family. Although looking at the facilities we did feel that the place is over priced but the facilities are well used and you feel very much as the owners of this place. The dartboard, TT table, Carrom (worn out) were at our disposal and the wonderful climate made us use all these very well.
