Hopefully they will built it again. 2) Few Hammocks here and there on the Camp with be great. 3) Plant a",naveenkumarverma,/Profile/naveenkumarverma,Bangalore,40
tehri-gharwal,"When you are on a tight schedule and wanna get out of the humdrum of city life, this is the place to go. My friends and I all wanted to go someplace to camp, sit around a bonfire, wind out and just relax. And we did just that. There was no mis-management and everything was clean and in order. The staff was soft-spoken and generous with their help. And on top of it all, we got to play with one of the cutest and jolly dogs I've ever met. This is one trip I'd like to take again.",Dhruv B,/Profile/772dhruvb,,50

tehri-gharwal,"I had one of the best getaways ever!! The place is perfect if you're looking for an unwinding and rejuvenating experience It's not too far from Delhi and that makes it perfect for a long weekend trip. I witnessed amazing sunsets and sunrises and camping in the lap of nature was truly exquisite. The camp organizers are very careful about your needs and the people are friendly and helpful. There was so much to do. We could choose from a range of adventure activities and were free to relax and enjoy nature's beauty too. Great experience, definitely going back soon!",TravelToesOfficial,/Profile/TravelToesOfficial,"New Delhi, India",50

tehri-gharwal,"I visited camp hammock, Tehri last weekend (holi weekend). The Camp is located in an apple-peach orchard. The location of the camp is mind blowing, i was awestruck when i first saw the view of the Chamba valley from the camp. The place is about 100mts from the road so, it feels like you are living in a jungle. I was woken up by the chirping of birds in the morning, i later went for a hike in the forest which is completely untouched by Humans. My afternoon was spent under a tree with a book in hand. The evenings were amazing, one of the best sunsets i saw at the camp. The bon fire and light music set the mood for the night. It was an amazing experience. A great place to unwind from the hustle bustle of the city, a place to feel content with oneself and nature.",Udit B,/Profile/212uditb,,50

tehri-gharwal,"The Camp Hammock near Tehri Dam has a picturesque location, with a breathtaking panoramic view of Himalayas. It is good place for team activity. For family also it will be good, but what actually add value to camping is various activities organised by camp like rock climbing etc. Such activities are best enjoyed in group on friend or team.  Personal experience about the Resort.  Camp Hammock stands different from the nearby tent accommodations which are available, all the tents are swiss tents i.e. if you put a pin on the wall it won’t pass through it. Inside the camps they are very spacious and come with 2+1 Beds which are comfortable and clean, All the camps have attached toilets which comes along with basic toiletries. That was inside the camp the moment you step outside the",Modita08,/Profile/Modita08,"Delhi, Delhi, India",50
