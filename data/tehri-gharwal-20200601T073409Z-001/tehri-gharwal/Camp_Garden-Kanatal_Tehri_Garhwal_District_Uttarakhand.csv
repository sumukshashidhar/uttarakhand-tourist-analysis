tehri-gharwal,"Very bad experience at Camp Garden camping. Very disappointed. There are only 3 persons (1 cook and 2 helper) who don't bother about anything, no manager, supervisor, owner available to fulfill your concerns. Dirty tents, bed sheets, quilts it look like they didn't change it and clean the tents from long time, spent whole night with wetty beds. Dirty washrooms & no hot water for bath. Conditions of washroom are very bad, very unhygienic. No drinking water in tents. Food was below then normal, no food choice, even during evening get together people are struggling for empty glass forget rest of things. Except location of camp nothing good, long grass. Frequent power cuts. No dinning hall. I surprised how they received 4+ rating. They don't deserve more than 1. In past, I visited",Parvinder Singh,/Profile/parvinderp2019,"Noida, India",10

tehri-gharwal,Camp Garden is almost the highest altitude camp site in Kanatal. It has excellent kept Swiss tents with attached washrooms-the rooms are a bit warm during the day time but hardly for an hour or so. The staff are extremely cordial and helpful. Would definitely recommend the acco. ,Varshaa,/Profile/Varshaa,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
tehri-gharwal,"Stayed here in May‚Äô18. It is on road and easily reachable. We made online booking , however it can be booked directly too.  Coming on to tents - they are very nicely kept, with attached washrooms. Clean linen n blankets are provided. This is dot on hill top with majestic view of the hills.  They provide breakfast, dinner, bonfire. Lunch we did in a nearby Himalayan kiwi restaurant.  A little bit of climbing on stairs is needed to go to camp though.
