tehri-gharwal,"Amazing owner, very relaxed atmosphere, very good value for the money and quality. If you want to get a very comfy, clean bed in a calm and nice paradise I really recommend The Sok. Clean and safe place, perfect for solo travelers, groups and even familes. They have a full furnished kitchen and facilities as well to as for any take away food. Very nice to relax under the mango trees.",Chloe G,/Profile/ChloeG1217,,50
