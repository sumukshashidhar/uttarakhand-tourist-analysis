tehri-gharwal,Spashram is a little paradise on the skirts of the Holy Ganges River. Perfect to relax and spend some quality time sorrounded by nature. Yoga session was outstanding with breathtaking views to the Ganges. Spashram has become one of my favorite places in India‚ô•Ô∏è. Thanks for the lovely stay and lovely people at the property.,Saisha Travel,/Profile/Saishatravel,Worldwide,50
tehri-gharwal,"Magical, mystical and all of the abundance one can experience at a single location. I absolutely loved it. The location is breathtaking beautiful. As you climb down the mountain not knowing what you expect, the raw ethereal beauty of Spashram hits you in the heart. Al fresco lunches, bonfire outdoor camps, dinner in a tent to the sound of the night, sky full of stars, the lull of the Ganges as she roars silently down the valley, the early morning chirp of birds greeting you, and the food for the soul. I will go back, again and again.",Ethel Da Costa,/Profile/EthelDaCosta,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",50

tehri-gharwal,"Spashram was just the place to relax after being on the go for two weeks with a great group of folks! Charlie and I appreciated the seclusion, the great meals, and above all the natural setting, right on the banks of the upper Ganga. The climb down and up isn't for the faint or the physically challenged, but adds to the ambience and our guides were very patient with us! Inder Jit and his staff were attentive but discreet. We especially appreciated the lemon IJ‚Äôs wife sent from Delhi!",Frieda,/Profile/FriedFrieda,,50
tehri-gharwal,"3 nights were not enough to enjoy in this small private paradise just by  a beautiful nature spot right on the ganges.  The team running the place led IJ and Rohit were amazing hosts. Great food, great service. Doing yoga right on the places' private, as well as doing rafting leaving straight from the same private beach, will become memories for life. Thank you Spashram.

tehri-gharwal,"What an amazing place!  Inder Jit and his staff went above and beyond to host us for a week at their wonderful retreat just a short trip up river from Rishikesh but far enough to enjoy the native flora and fauna with out tripping over tourists.  They provided us with three incredible, gourmet meals everyday plus clean, modern yet eclectic sleeping accommodations as well as arranging several trekking experiences and side trips to the source of the Ganges and central Rishikesh. This was our first trip to India and certainly not our last.  On our return we plan on letting Tiger Paw adventures handle all the arrangements.  They were so amazing I can't imagine planning a trip without their expertise.",Gary E,/Profile/489gary,,50
tehri-gharwal,"Spashram is a special place. The beautiful Ganges, birds, butterflies, and other wildlife, combined with friendly local staff & yoga at dawn. Just the right place if you're looking for more than an India cookie cutter experience.",flrorianr,/Profile/flrorianr,,50

tehri-gharwal,"Our 3-night stay at Spashram was the highlight of a 5-week trip to India. From the moment we arrived, to a rousing bagpipe welcome, it was evident that this was a special place. You do need to be reasonably mobile to negotiate the long, steep and winding path down to the site, but once there you enter another world with a magic combination of wilderness with luxury. We stayed in a spacious lodge called Leopard Longhouse, with views from the veranda of the Ganges and mountain scenery. It boasted a huge comfortable bed and every modern convenience, including a drinks cabinet and no less than two bathrooms, generously supplied with fluffy towels and beautiful organic toiletries. Meals, served in the dining tent, were copious, convivial and exceptionally varied, catering to every",JessicaEH927,/Profile/JessicaEH927,"Farnham Common, United Kingdom",50
tehri-gharwal,"2 nights were not enough to enjoy the the natural beauty of Spashram and surrounding areas.  Staying in tents you are never far away from the sounds of the river, the birds and other wildlife. Yoga on the beach was memorable for me and after two days of sampling the natural spring water, local organic food and fresh clean air, I felt completely rejuvenated.  For the more active, you can experience rock climbing, hiking or river-rafting.  Otherwise, relax and enjoy therapies such as Reflexoloy and Massage and soak in the sunshine on the white sand beach.   Excellent friendly staff, nothing was too much trouble!",JacquieDevonUK,/Profile/JacquieDevonUK,Devon UK,50
tehri-gharwal,"Spashram and operator TigerPaw are THE way to enjoy the Ganges river.  At their campsite near Rishikesh, they provide perfect rustic comfort.  You'll stay in tents--but the tents have their own showers, toilets, and beds.  You'll eat oustide, but it will be a fantastic meal at a table on a cliff overlooking the river.  You can lounge on a white sand beach, fish, go rock climbing, whitewater rafting, or go hiking.  TigerPaw's team does a great job of anticipating and providing for your every need, in a manner that is charming and not overdone.  I spent two years in India, and ONLY when traveling with TigerPaw or at Spashram was I ever able to fully relax, comforted by knowing this outfit understands how to provide appropriate service.",Greg A,/Profile/GregA432,"Washington, DC",50
tehri-gharwal,"Almost at the end of a 6-week tour of India, we were lucky enough to have been introduced to Spashram RiverMountain Retreat - right smack on the Ganges, in our own large private tent from which we could hear the river all night, walking up the stone steps, bordered by flowers & trees, to the Long House and outdoor dining area where delicious meals were served to us, good hiking, wonderful river-rafting, beauty everywhere.  Two nights were not nearly enough.",BerylV,/Profile/BerylV,San Francisco,50
tehri-gharwal,"The Spashram RiverMountain Retreat is a complex of tent-cabins hidden in the trees and foliage on a steep hillside beside the upper Ganges River.  It is quite rustic, without electricity or even running water, and yet we were provided with every comfort.  Everything is done with complete environmental consciousness. The food was excellent, the service was gracious and efficient. They arranged guided hikes around the area, to waterfalls and local villages and arranged for an whitewater rafting trip down the Ganges that ended just about Rishikesh.",Zedarb G,/Profile/zedarb,"Oakland, California",50
