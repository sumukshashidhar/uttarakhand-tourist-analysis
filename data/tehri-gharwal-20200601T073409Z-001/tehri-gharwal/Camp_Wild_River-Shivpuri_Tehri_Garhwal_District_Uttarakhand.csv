tehri-gharwal,A nice quaint place situated on the river bank of Ganges.  A unique idea of camping and is very close to nature. It is a beautiful place close to nature. The plus point was that the stay is in a tent which we have not done any time in the past. The evening campfire along with the snacks was awesome. The lunch and dinner were ok however we did not expect anything great hence the disappointment was also less. One thing which requires a great improvement is the toilets. They stink and the management needs to ensure that basic hygiene is maintained by them.,Suresh I,/Profile/SureshKIyer,"Thane, India",30
