tehri-gharwal,"I visited twice in the year 2017. First in June and it was a wonderful experience. Food, tents , swimming pool everything was great. So I planned again in September , called them and the accepted booking. I paid them in advance.  everything was so bad at that time to our surprise. AC wasn't working, electricity was gone middle of the night and no back up started. We felt scary at that place as it is very far away from the main city. Not many people were staying there at that time. We went to find someone after collecting our courage but no one wanted to listen and help. That was pathetic. Food was not good. So what I will suggest is go in season only you may enjoy.",Meenakshi R,/Profile/MeenakshiR99,"New Delhi, India",30
tehri-gharwal,We were two couples and visited this hotel for one night stay. The hotel is located in Shivpuri beside river rafting point. The environment is peaceful and we found mostly foreigners stay here. The complimentary dinner and breakfast is awesome. The hotel has a small pool. We did river rafting while stay in this hotel.,Dr Soumen Mandal,/Profile/soumenm508,"Durgapur, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"I visited shivpuri in june for rafting. while searching for good  family resort , i found himalyan retreat , the location of this resort is beautiful,probably one the best in shivpuri its a big green resort with lots of plants and trees  like mango, lemons etc there is a  pool at the edge of the resort overlooking greenmountains and river , .the package we got was value for money , as it include snacks,barbeque, dinner breakfast and river rafting , food was good in taste, the negatives were :-slight mismanagement because of shortage of staff,as we had to remind several time to get things done, the dining area was not well lit, but overall it was a good experience staying here",RSKLA,/Profile/RSKLA,India,40
tehri-gharwal,"Visited the Himalayan Retreat in October 2016. Beautiful scenic location with a peaceful ambience.  Positives -   Location - close to town yet nestled away in the hills with a scenic view of the river.  Food - Excellent! Wide variety and yummy. Had 5 dishes in each meal with very generous portions. Kudos to the cook!!  Staff - Very polite and helpful; always ready to lend a hand and make your stay comfortable  Areas of Improvement:  Pool - Placed at a beautiful spot; however was not maintained/managed well. Water was knee level and had to inform staff to get it fully functional. Earnest effort by them, however very disappointing as it felt more like a pond.   Lighting - The lights in the cottages are very dim. Contents in one's suitcase are also difficult to see; however",Sanjolie,/Profile/Sanjolie,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"Been coming here for the last five years.This place is a strictly no frills place. No luxury but very comfortable. Come to this place with this in mind, you will find it to be excellent. The accommodation is basic, in cottages or tents but comfortable. The location is very good. while taking a dip from the swimming pool, which is at the edge of the property, one gets a beautiful view of the Ganga, surrounding hills and the highway. The excellent service is provided by local boys, lead by Daulat and Diwan. They are always around to give you the best of comfort and look after your needs. They also make excellent food as per your choice. The owner, Rajeev Tiwari is just a phone call away.",travellorsunil,/Profile/travellorsunil,"New Delhi, India",40

Would definitely visit Highbank again.",Aroop R,/Profile/aroopr,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
tehri-gharwal,"Location It is right in Shivpuri on main highway. You can just park your car on highway and go up to this place. just 10-15 ft above highway. They have place to park your car.  View From Place You get a good view of Ganga from their cottages. As it is located even higher then highway.  Place itself They have two type of cottages. One is brick made and other is swiss tents. Both are equipped with AC. This place has lot of open space and has a small pool in corner, which look good. It is not wow place, nor it is something that may put you off. In all it is a good place to be in. If you opt for non-AC cottage, they provide a fan in cottage. In day time it might get hot, but in night surely you have to put this fan off.  It is hardly 10 min downward walk to river ganga.  Food and",RajbirJaglan,/Profile/RajbirJaglan,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",40

tehri-gharwal,"Just when the decision was taken for a out-of-city office trip for 15 people, thought of shivpuri came and all of us agreed immediately.  Tour was arranged by Distant India Journeys' Mr. Ajay Sethi, who is incidentally the brother-in-law of a colleague.  It was a 2 day trip and we all started with lot of excitement and enthusiasm . Comfortable journey by bus which was also arranged by Distant India and we reached Shivpuri. Awestruck by the serenity and natural beauty of the place, we were welcomed by the Himalayan Retreat hotel staff in a complete indian conventional manner with Vedic chants and at the same time were offered with cold drinks too.  Distant India took care of everything, right from the bus to the tour manager at shivpuri.  Well protected swiss tented huts with all",Travelogue1310,/Profile/Travelogue1310,"New Delhi, India",50

tehri-gharwal,"Basic but rustic facilities. There are big open lawns, mango and litchi trees and huge lawns. There is a swimming pool in one corner of the property. when in the pool, one can have an excellent view of Ganga which is across the road. There are air conditioned cottages and air conditioned Swiss tents, sparsely furnished but comfortable. No televisions anywhere, they are not missed. The food is excellent, served lovingly and the staff is ever helpful. They have an experienced and helpful team which takes care of you in rafting trips. The mountain views are awesome.
