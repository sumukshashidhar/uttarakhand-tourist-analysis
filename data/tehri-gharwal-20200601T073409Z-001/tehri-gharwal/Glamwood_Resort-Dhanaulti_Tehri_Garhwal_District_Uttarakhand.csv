tehri-gharwal,"The resort is located at an isolated place. I don't find any hoarding of Glamwood in the way which made the remaining  few Kms very confusing and irritating. To reach the resort you need to drive on muddy and a very narrow road. There is no Parking place available and visitors are forced to keep their vehicles on the way. The resort is situated at a very perpendicular height and trekking is the only option. There seems no difference between Elite and classic rooms.   On Facilities: I see visitors chasing for every small item. You will not find the room ready for check-in. We were not provided towels and other prerequisites from day 2nd. TVs are not recharged, phones don't work. Bonfire are the costliest there across UK. Mr Jagdish is the only responsible person over there and",Amitabha G,/Profile/463amitabhag,,30
tehri-gharwal,V-Resorts Management should actually go and review the affliated properties....  Itz a getaway camp for bachelors or yoing/ middle-aged couples... Very peaceful and beautiful view...  STRICTLY not recommended for Seniors and kids... Located on steep height which has to be covered on foot (400+meters) without steps and proper railings... No approach for wheel chair or stroller.. No play area for kids..  Power cut-off is very often.. about 24 hours during our 72 hours stay. No generator only inverter power supplied to rooms... No kettle / refrigerator / hot plate available in room. Morning tea is served after 8.30am.  No hot water geysers in room. Only Solar powered central system. First day there was no hot water at all.. Got hot water from kitchen to take a bath..  No buffet /,Manpreet Grover,/Profile/830manpreetg,,30
tehri-gharwal,Its a very newly opened resort..nice.. peaceful.. cozy & spacious..with all the basic amenities..  Food is very nice .. hospitality also was good..overall a decent resort economically priced...If the occupancy is less then the service is amazing..as staff is less there but expect a delay if you are going in large groups.. Thanks to all for a wonderful experience..  ..,Vaani M,/Profile/VaaniM6,,40
tehri-gharwal,"Glamwood resort might be a few months old but the hospitality of the people makes you feel like you are their regular and favourite customers. From the location which is in the lap of mountains, to the cottage rooms which are so comfortable that you would want to spend every night there, everything is what a city dweller craves for on a long weekend. The evening we reached the resort was just perfect. The caretaker asked if we wanted a bonfire and who could say no to that?! So with the bonfire, mellow music in the background and the starry sky with passing clouds it was a beautiful. Glamwood is the best place to stay in Dhanaulti. The caretaker will take perfect care of you and you would never have to ask for anything twice. And do not miss the food!",shailesh s,/Profile/shaileshs480,,50
