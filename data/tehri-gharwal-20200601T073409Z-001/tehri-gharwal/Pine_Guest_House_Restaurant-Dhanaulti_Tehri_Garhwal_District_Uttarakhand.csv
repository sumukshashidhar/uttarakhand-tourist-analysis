tehri-gharwal,"Small guest house cum hotel, decent in mid of Dhanaulti, staff and owners are truly honest and helpful. No over charges and no fancies. Very colourful outlook rooms are small but cozy specially in chilling winters, food is good, access to kitchen helps you to guide them as per your taste. Over-all if last minute booking or in dhanaulti and low budget stay there and have good hospitality, else if you have MONEY ENOUGH GO OVERSPEND IN BIGGER HOTELS WHO PROBABLY NOT HAVE SERVICES.",HimanshuPM,/Profile/HimanshuPM,"New Delhi, India",30
