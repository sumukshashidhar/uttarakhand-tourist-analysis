tehri-gharwal,"WONDERFUL !!! You won't find better anywhere in India. This place is the most lovely, warm and beautiful place you will stay at. Nidhi and her partner managed to set up a home stay that makes everybody feel welcome in the first seconds. I have not felt better and more relaxed after this great experience. You've got the Himalayas, valley, local village (full of amazing people who are interested in meeting you!), clean air and amazing nature for walking. The sunrises and sunsets are truly magical as well! Thank you Niddhi and Yudhish!",Suzanne,/Profile/Suzannekoning1989,,50
tehri-gharwal,"This was one of the nicest accommodation experiences, if not the nicest, since coming to India.   Yudhish is a pure gentleman and was incredibly professional and attentive. The house is really clean and has a very relaxing feel.  It is is in a beautiful setting with glorious views. The food was delicious..thanks to Didi and Yudhish. I even was shown a few yoga postures by Yudhish.   On my last morning the local bus did not arrive and Yudhish drove me 20k to the next town...incredibly kind. Thank you for a wobderful stay.
