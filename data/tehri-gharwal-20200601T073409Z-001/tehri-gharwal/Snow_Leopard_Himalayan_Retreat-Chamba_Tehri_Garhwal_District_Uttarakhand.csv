tehri-gharwal,"The Snow Leopard camps are almost in Shivpuri, which is about 50 kms from Rishikesh and takes 1.5 hours to reach. They have two camping options.  1. Tents on the banks of the Ganga - these look beautiful and pristing in the white sand, but we didn't dare choose them in the Dec 31st freeze-fest. They do not have electicity or attached toilets, so if you're an eskimo used to relieving yourself in open pits, this is the place for you.  2. Tents off the main road. This is about a 10-min walk from the banks of the Ganga. These are larger, brick structures (with tents cast over them), with electricity and attached toilets. And yes, they will provide you a heater if you ask them for it.   Needless to say, we chose the second option. The inside of the tents were dingy, very dimly lit",DipakKrishnamani,/Profile/DipakKrishnamani,"Mumbai, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"Snow Leopard camps are situated ahead of Rishikesh (if one goes uphill). They have 2 camps - one right on the banks of river Ganga, and the other on a small hill (close to the river). I stayed in the latter one for a couple of days - about 20 of us had gone there for an office team building event. Tents are nice with all the basic amenities and good buffet food. But service levels were low, and staff could have been more courteous. Also, for the price the group paid and comparing with tariffs offered by nearby camps (found out later), looks like it is a bit overpriced.  Note: I have also stayed in the camp on the river bank and had a much better experience, but that was more than 5 years back - so do not want to let it impact on the recent review.",gauravbansal83,/Profile/gauravbansal83,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",30
tehri-gharwal,"I have been to rishikesh 3 times before but snow leopard is the most professional and disciplined of the lot. They have tents for 2 with plenty of space inside. They have great instructors for rafting, Kayaking and rapling. They also have games like cricket and  volleyball and would set up a bonfire at night with excellent snacks/food. They organize things as per your convenience. So if one is planning a rafting trip, dish out a little extra and enjoy the snow leopard experience.",alterego84,/Profile/alterego84,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"A bunch of 30- 40 people set out to celebrate 'Holi' 2010 at the holy city Rishikesh. We were a bunch of strangers together in a group called the 'Ganga Panga'. But the excitement and anxiety to celebrate Holi next to the mighty Ganges kept me going.  We stayed at a camp called called Snow Leopard with individual tents, hot showers, great food, bonfire at night and brilliant company. Non- ending activities like river rafting, kayaking, volleyball, rappelling, cliff jumping and body surfing were a part our trip as well. A few of us attended the 'Puja' next to the Ganges where a feeling of calmness and serenity took us over.  The trip left some wonderful memories and experiences in I. I returned with new friends and experiences to last me awhile.",samvedita,/Profile/samvedita,New Delhi,50
