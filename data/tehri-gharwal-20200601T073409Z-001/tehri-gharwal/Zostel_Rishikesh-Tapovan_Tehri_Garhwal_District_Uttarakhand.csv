tehri-gharwal,"Me and my partner stayed a week at the Zostel in Februari. Very clean and proper place, good accomodation.   What really touched us is the Yogic F6 5 food I ate in my life. Now it's March and we still come here!!   6 weeks in Rishikesh and this is truly the best food place we found! The chef with 32 years experience kept suprising us everyday, a true delight for the senses. I recommend this place to everyone.  Also cosy, very friendly staff, the place has good vibes and attracts very interesting people from all over the world. ",Yannick VE,/Profile/YannickVEtravel,"Grobbendonk, Belgium",50

From singing alongside the Ganges to bonfires to choreographing dance on Govinda's song. Best Zostel in terms of activities I have visited so far.  Then comes the accommodation part, Veer and rakhi were amazing as well. They made my stay feel at home. In 2 days we talked as we were a family. Any request I made, they tried there best to fulfill it.  The rooms were very spacious and very cozy to stay in and also very clean considering it to be a hostel.

Worth the time and price. Since i was there for 3 days i felt that it was too less will surely plan for a longer stay because of the good vibes. Our cafe manager was also very welcoming.

The staff is very friendly and are very accomodative of any reasonable request that you may have. Full marks to the team here.

The staff at Zostel Rishikesh was very friendly and they made me feel like at home. I would really like to take this opportunity to thank the Zostel staff (the double A's i.e Ankit and Ankit, Vir and Shashi). They really made my stay a special one and I would really cherish these moments for a long time to come. It is a kind of platform where the traveller community meets, interacts and share their views about each other's cultures, food, travelling and what not.

They have the policy - if you are more than in 4 in numbers then they will divide you in a group of maximum 4 number and will provide you different rooms - which I think is not appropriate. Because people go there to enjoy and to stays together. 2. Rooms are good, clean and having enough space and beds are also very comfortable. 3. They TT Table, Carrom games - which is good for some time pass activities. 4. They have separate Common Area - where you can sit you friends do some chitchats. 5. They have book library also if you are intersting in reading books.  Something which I didn't like 1. First day sheets was not available to attached it with the quilt. On second day room service they provided us. So i guess it was a mistake they forgot to put there. 2. For us Room Toilets",Adhish Rai,/Profile/AdhishRai,,40

At Zostel I was greeted by the friendliest of faces which included Anil. Zostel rules dictate that they wouldn't allow me to check into rooms until noon. Anil went above and beyond his duties as an employee at Zostel and offered a bed and locker (and shower) in the common area. I gladly accepted. Anil and I had a heart to heart conversation and he is one of the friendliest person I have met who made me feel as comfortable as home.

The Rishikesh Property is one of their oldest and hence it does need an urgent renovation. There fore slightly felt disappointed with the feel of the rooms.

Moreover, we had experience a big water corruption and technical works, with a lot of noise RIGHT in front of our room in 7.30 in the morning. Twice. Last but not least the receptionist was sleeping the day we were leaving the hostel and we were looking for him more than 20 minutes.

I did have my doubts about living in a dorm, but the experience turned out to be one hell of a vacation! The rooms are extremely clean and well maintained. Zostel not only provides you a place to stay (and very cheap at that), but also a complete package that involves meeting other backpakers, sharing travel experiences, music nights, hours of board games (and so much awesome bonding over Jenga) and a inhouse library. I was so impressed by it that I cut short my journey in the Himalayas by two days to spend that time in Rishikesh! Speaks for itself, right?

Also you can go for the sunrise trek, waterfall trek and cool activities like rafting and Zostel will do all that for you.

The upstairs cafe is a little disappointing and is just old mattresses on the floor with a few tables. Looks much nicer in the photographs. Breakfast is overpriced I would say and can find better elsewhere. The main points for an average rating are a) the bed and b) the wifi. The beds were sadly, but certainly, the hardest I have encountered in India. I may aswell have slept on the floor. I don't even know whether it was a mattress. The wifi is absolutely terrible.

tehri-gharwal,I spent 3 days earlier this month and this was me trying to reacquaint myself with the hosteling experience. I was a bit apprehensive but was immediately put to ease by the Zostel staff. I was invited to a rafting session which was followed by a game of Monopoly which went on for close to 6 hours. The rest of the 3 days days passed by similarly and there is little scope of being bored unless you want to detach yourself. Thanks guys and wish to see you again. Will definitely visit Zostel and want to try out the other locations as well.,Kunal M,/Profile/KunalM472,,50

Shashi and Gaurav were two members of Zostel staff I had interaction with and they were a charm to get acquainted with.

Particularly the activities they organise are awesome. I met a staff there, Mr. Ankit Panwar. He was wonderful, he played the guitar at musical night. He took us to trekking to neer waterfall, every evening high tea, even helped me with bookings for various activities.

tehri-gharwal,This is one of the loveliest hotel located near the banks of river Ganga and is about 1km from the main city of Haridwar. The hotel offers dormitory as well as single rooms to its customer.The crowd is cool and the staff is very friendly.There is a garden in the zostel names after Beatles which looks cool.Neer water falls are located close by.Overall it's trendy and a really nice place to visit.,bk139,/Profile/bk139,,50

Staff will hook you up with scooters - make sure you ask for helmets!   Really great rooftop eating lounge area.   Great food - great prices.   The growing pile of plastic water bottles out back is disturbing - but a reminder to be a mindful tourist.   I used the airport pick-up and felt very safe as a single woman traveller.   10 min walk from the bridge.   I checked in for 3 nights - stayed 9.

When asked to change the bedding there was a disgustingly stained mattress protector underneath which also had to be changed. The bed was subsequently changed three times as each time the sheets brought in were not clean and had lots of stains! The room over looked waste ground which also wasn't very appealing. The staff at the hostel are pleasant but sadly the hostel its self feels very run down. The rooftop restaurant is grubby and basic, and it took about 40mins to wait for a very average bowl of soup. Also the communal areas don't look anywhere near as nice as the glossy management photos and were a real let down. There are so many better value places to stay in",saraowen3,/Profile/saraowen3,,30

Exceptional air con and comfortable spaces to chill and watch movies.  Unfortunately for Zostel (as with its other locations) it sometimes seems to miss the point of what a hostel should be about regardless of location.   Being told off for eating in the common room, and not being able to drink alcohol are small issues, but for those on a budget who want a safe place where they are not judged, it seems a little bit imposing and can feel somewhat condescending.
