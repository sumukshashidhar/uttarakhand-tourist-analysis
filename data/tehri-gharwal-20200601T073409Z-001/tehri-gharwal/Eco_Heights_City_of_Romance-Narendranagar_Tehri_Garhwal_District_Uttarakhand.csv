tehri-gharwal,The location is the USP of this place. The magnificent views of the surrounding Valleys and Hills is simply awesome! One can sit and relax entire day within the resort itself. The food too was really very tasty and served with real sense of service.,vikas260978,/Profile/vikas260978,"Faridabad, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"The purpose of selecting such a place are two. First, a peaceful location, and comfortable service.   I believe this resort only partially met my expectations. The lunch served was moderate. Nothing great I can say about it except the fact that the small dining room looked good and the plates looked white. What made me upset is the food service. Looks like onc has to demand type of food, and there is no good buffet with choices. Travelling with children, it was a harrowing experience that the meals were abysmally delayed, Dinner at was served only at 10:00 though they say it starts at 0900 PM. Even the concept of dinner at 0900 is something I could not convincing. Similar delay was seen in serving other meals too though despite making prior requests for all meals for all days",kumhannah,/Profile/kumhannah,"Hanoi, Vietnam",30
