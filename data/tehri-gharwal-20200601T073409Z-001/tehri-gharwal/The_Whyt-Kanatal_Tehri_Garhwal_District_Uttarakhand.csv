tehri-gharwal,"We were looking for a place to enjoy our winter amidst the Himalayas and we got what we wanted and much more.  First coming to the hotel, it is a decent one with comfortable rooms, nicely furnished and with glass windows that offer excellent views, especially of the extended winter sunset which was so beautiful that you could spend an hour or two just watching the various changing hues and colors of the winter line. The winter line is a magical, visual treat that happens only at a few places in the world in the winter months.  The sky at night is bewitching with millions of stars, galaxies, and constellations adorning the sky. A walk down the dark road is thrilling.   The restaurant at the upper deck is spacious with good delicious food served by the Ustad. You can order what",Gautham,/Profile/pgautham,,50
tehri-gharwal,"A very comfortable and soothing property with rooms overlooking the beautiful view of the mountains. The hotel staff is very warm and friendly. Their roof top restaurant is all you could ask for a perfect barbecue evening. The food served was delicious! The location of the hotel is perfect for nature lovers as it gives a breathtaking view of the majestic Himalayas and is good for nature walks. Kanatal is a beautiful and pristine village nestled in the Kaudia range of Uttarakhand. If you are looking for a peaceful getaway from the city, then this little hamlet in the mountains is a place to be at!",Eshna,/Profile/eshna3,"Bengaluru, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"Mine was a last minute booking done over phone and they guided me very well. I stayed there for a day only but was memorable due their courteous service and some good food. I was travelling with my family, room suggestion given by them was perfect and was value for money. View from the property was very good, especially from the restaurant in first floor. In terms of sight seeing as well their recommendations were good (Tehri lake/dam on the way back). I made a special request for some fruits for dinner and they went to the market got it for us. For a small hotel this kind of service will take them places.  Thanks Lalith and team",Arvind kumar S,/Profile/298arvinds,,50

tehri-gharwal,"Nearly 4-5 hours drive from Jolly grant airport, the roads were good.  The rooms are looked average but after spending a few hours at the hotel we were in love with its location, the food is beyond expectation- fabulous spread, the staff is just so courteous, and the valley view from rooms window is amazing. We also visit for jungle safari and that was also amazing after that we visited tihri lake that is 1 hour distance from hotel we enjoy water sports there. Staff was very cooperative. Also one of main Hindu pilgrime Surakanda mata temple at 10 minutes drive with 360 degree picturesque view of entire Himalaya from this top most hill top. On any clear day one can see almost all himalayan ranges & yamunotri to Badrinath. So must visit place in this region.",Lalit,/Profile/Lalitkumar782,,40
