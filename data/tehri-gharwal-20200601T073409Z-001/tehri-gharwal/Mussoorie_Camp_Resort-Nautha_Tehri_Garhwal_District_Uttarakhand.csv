tehri-gharwal,They have nice tent. But u will not find hot water there. Nd food which was offered it doesn't have variety and taste. Stayed there for one night. Prices are on a higher side. They do have parking space.,parul k,/Profile/parul9900,"New Delhi, India",30

tehri-gharwal,"I am from Mussoorie but now live in Mumbai, so we wanted to have a relaxed holiday so we decided to go to Camp Resort which has one of best views and so quiet(Mussoorie is not quiet anymore). Highlights of the trip Barbeque that we did on born fire,juciest chicken I have ever had. I thought since we are staying in Camps we will have common washroom but no, every tent has their own washrooms and very clean Serene view You can party till whatever time you want to.
