tehri-gharwal," We were quite skeptical as to what property to choose for our stay at Rishikesh. We found this one and booked it keeping it as backup. We searched around 70-80 properties but none of them could match the benchmark set by this one considering the price and location. It is located outside the city and appears rather suddenly. Though the sign is quite big and it is hard to miss it, we still believe if a few hoardings or directions could have been put up in order to reach this place in one go. The property is in one word, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.  Rooms: The rooms were quite enormous and were utterly clean, The toilets and common area were also kept perfectly neat.

Intricate Landscaping allowed many nooks and corners to comeup , to give an impression of a big resort in an otherwise smallish place.

They were jumping in the pool with clothes & shoes and eating & drinking in the pool and no one to check or control them. Our repeated complaints went to deaf ears as no one was bothered there.

The food was just like any food you'll find anywhere in a normal Delhi restaurant.   Now the reason behind giving two stars. Though we were staying in the resort, when we went to click some photos near the pool, they objected and said they charge an additional of 5000/- for doing a photoshoot there. When we said we would click only 2-3 photos they still weren't co-operative at all.

The only reason they charge so much is that they located in the outskirts of River Ganga, rest their is nothing as such.  Second, when you try to click a picture with your DSLR, they will charge you Rs.5000 in the name of pre wedding photo shoot. Third, their staff Named Sushil Srivastava is very rude and will not treat you like a guest.  You will not find anything to eat near by, you only have the option of eating inside the resort and they take undue advantage of that by leving high prices on the Food menu.

tehri-gharwal,"Resort is located in shivpuri - close to the location where rafting camps come up .   Location is great , with a Machaan  like sit out at a  under the trees.  Which gives a perfect sport to stare at the fast moving Ganges right next to you.    Rooms r well appointed - all rooms face river side . A small pool becomes a good activity ground for families.    Food is good - though you should expect slow  service - these parts of world - speed is a relative terms ( and on second thoughts - we go there to slow down life , not to be in a hurry ) .

tehri-gharwal,The resort is peacefully surrounded and situated at the banks of river Ganga in shivpuri. Rooms were clean and tidy but the staffs are not well trained and the food quality was just ok but overall the location was excellent so we really had a great time and would love to visit again and very important for rafters it's one of the best location to stay.,Neha j,/Profile/702nehaj,"Jaipur District, India",40

With an array of leisure activities, top tier pampering and perfectly at home within its scenic surroundings. This resort is heavenly colourful with greenery all around.

tehri-gharwal,It is located at the best location in the city. The hotel's white sand beach adds more stars to it. The rooms are well maintained and you can enjoy playing Table Tennis and Carrom at the club. The food at times wasn't good otherwise satisfactory. The main drawback was the slow room service.  Worth the money. Would certainly recommend.,rishijain99,/Profile/rishijain99,"Jodhpur, India",40

Service, maintenance and staff quality needs improvement but a decent option to stay for 1-2 days. Having experienced two more properties around - would rate it 3rd between Raga, Glasshouse and Namami.

tehri-gharwal,"Pros:  Great location, nice views from the rooms, good sit-out areas, decent pool. All this also comes with lip-smacking food, a giant swing, well-maintained garden and courteous staff.   Cons:  1. They advertise that they have wifi, but it can only be accessed in the hotel lobby.  2. They advertise that they have sauna, but it is not operational. 3. They will not do the customary room-cleaning, unless specifically asked to(wth) 4.They have a horrible parking area. You will forever be searching for guests to remove their cars so that you can take yours out. Very annoying for both the parties. 5. They advertise that they have a private beach area, but it is not private. It is a very nice place but can be accessed by anyone.

tehri-gharwal,"I visited the resort in May'2015. This resort was newly opened then. The resort has great a location, near the shores of Ganges and very easy access to beach.  Rooms are spacious, balconies are great, but room decor needs improvement.  Swimming pool is very small and  filled by river water without any filtration, hence not a good experience.   Room service lacks experience of a good resort, most of the staff seemed to be hired from 1-2 star rating hotel who does not know how to serve at an expensive resort.",vaibhavarora20,/Profile/vaibhavarora20,"New Delhi, India",40

Every aspect of this wonderful resort impressed, especially the space age design of the suite combined with a brilliant idea to pump Ganges water (Gangajal) into the beautiful pool for taking a dip in the privacy of this lovely new resort.

All the Adventure activities are available nearby (i-e rafting, zip line, etc), The thatched huts have very nyc view of Ganges & mountains. The sound of Ganges feels you fresh & rejuvenating.   Expect the food quality & services. The main thing they didn't allowed room service for main course, so you have to go to restaurant to have a food.

tehri-gharwal,a very good destination and wonderful experience. The place is calm and the adventure activities are quite nearby.So a must go place and the service is quite satisfactory.  Only the room service needs to be fastened. I am expecting the same would be improved with no compromise on quality. The food quality is very good.  Also the swimming pool needs to be given extra care like cleanliness and needs to be covered with shed. And more children games and activities as well as for elders needs to be installed.
