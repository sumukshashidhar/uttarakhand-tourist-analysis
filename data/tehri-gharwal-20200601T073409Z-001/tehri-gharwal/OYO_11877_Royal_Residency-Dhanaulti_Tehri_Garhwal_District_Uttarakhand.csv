tehri-gharwal,"Good location, nice food at reasonable price. Very good service ample parking. We felt issue with too soft and spongy mattress leading uncomfortable sleep.no swimming pool etc. In short it's a place to chill, relax n eat. Eco park and surkanda temple of Matta is nearby.alcohol shop, medical shop within 500 meter away.can have trip to tehri dam .",Sightseer818094,/Profile/Sightseer818094,,40
tehri-gharwal,"The best thing about this place is its location. The hotel is right next to the dhanaulti market, where utility shops and restaurants are there. This property is situated almost in the center of both the Eco parks Ambar and Dhara so you can visit them both. These Eco parks are one and only popular point in dhanaulti after the Sarkunda devi temple. The hotel rooms were clean, spacious and well managed. The management also allowed the early check in on request and upgraded me to a bigger room after seeing that I have a kid as well. The hotel staff is very polite and helpful. The pandit ji in the staff over there are very courteous.The parathas served in the breakfast were good and tasty, masala tea was also very good. their in house restaurant serves good food with the room",Prashant Sisodiya,/Profile/PrashantTraveller7,,50
tehri-gharwal,"I am a frequent but budget traveller. When I made plan to visit Dhanaulti - an upcoming hill station - yes, the place is yet to develop fully as a full fledged destination, I zeroed in on The Royal Residency hotel there. I booked it on MMT. Though, this was an off season and only few dare to travel hills in chilly winter, the rates were not so low. We were three so booked their best room named  - Premium Royal room for three nights. It was three bedded. The location is excellent - on main road in the middle of the town between two Eco Parks. The room  (No. 304) was spacious with two balconies and the front as well as rear view pleasing to eyes. Cleanliness everywhere. The washroom, however was a bit smaller, moreover in place of health faucet, commode was fitted with jet flow.",Ratnesh M,/Profile/ratnesh045,"New Delhi, India",40

tehri-gharwal,"Co-owner (Mr. R K Raghav) at reception is rude. we booked 2 rooms for 2N and 3D and it includes breakfast. We reached early and asked for early check-in but he said we have to wait till 11 as no room is readyand we agreed upon it. Suddenly he came back in 10 mins and asked us that rooms are there but we have to pay early check-in price. We booked 2 rooms and requested him if he can give one room as early check-in and the other room we will take later. He denied but after some time he gave both rooms @ 250 as early check-in. The room that we booked is Royal rooms from Make my trip but actual rooms were totally different. After aaking him about the room he said those are super royal room and you have to pay more for that.

tehri-gharwal,"It was a pleasant experience while staying here. The rooms were clean and tidy. The best part of staying here was its location, in middle of town (Dhanaulti Mall Road). Though in middle of the town Dhanaulti is famous for peace with a fantastic weather and serene view of the Himalayas and the place is apt for it. The place is only a minute walk from the famous Eco park. The place is equipped with all the amenities i.e. Wifi, in house catering, free parking and well equipped rooms. The service was upto the mark and the staff was well behaved. Highly reccomendable if looking for a stay in Dhanaulti.",mordhwajsingh1,/Profile/mordhwajsingh1,"Faridabad, India",50

tehri-gharwal,"We Stayed at Royal Residency in December 2017 with family for a couple of days. This was unplanned one as a result we chose the best possible available hotel at Dhanaulti at that point. Happy we chose Royal Residency. The place may not be the best in terms of the location ...but definitely the best value for money with decent location, Great food, of course very prompt service and amazing hospitality. On food - the place really serves one of the best, better that more expensive restaurants, one of which we tried for our dinner. It costed twice but half tasty.  The property does not have lift so staying on the first floor would be advisable in case you plan in and out of your rooms often in a single day but the location makes it up which is right at the center of action (while",Aveek Roy C,/Profile/AveekRoyC1,"Pune, India",40
