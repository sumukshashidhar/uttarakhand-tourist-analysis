tehri-gharwal,"We have been to this place for the first time and had a good experience with endless grazing hills and panoramic views of the mountains & snow covered peaks of the Himalayas from the resort is really breathtaking. Great hilly area where the clouds and mountains are visible at same level. Darbar (Badshahithaul, Chamba) is a perfect place to experience nature’s beauty and hills atmosphere along with the widespread abundance in sceneries. The area is accessorized with activities like Farming at its own place, Jungle Safari/Trekking as well as water sports at Tehri Lake, Live sunset visibility from the resorts balcony, all together makes it a perfect tourist destination. Accommodation is good, limited staff but helpful. Darbar Resort is about 4 KM’s Chamba Market & 10 KM’s from",Manish Verma,/Profile/HIFEED,"Dehradun District, India",50
tehri-gharwal,Two people run the place Upendra and  Sandeep. We booked two rooms for family of 4 people. Had to sleep in one room why? The manager stays in room no.7 and is not visible ever. But has a presence how? He is heard swearing on the phone and i feel is drunkard . Please avoid the hotel till he leaves otherwise go at your own risk. A great hotel wasted by bad manager. ,vishal1974,/Profile/vishal1974,"New Delhi, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"I & my wife had stayed here for 3 days. The location is serene with lovely views of the mountains. The accommodation is basic & comfortable. However, the housekeeping is not up to the mark. The towels & bedsheets are not changed everyday. The food is simple & tasty.",sanjaychakrabarti,/Profile/sanjaychakrabarti,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
tehri-gharwal,"While touring Uttarakhand by motorbike, the organisers arranged this quirky hotel for us. We were pleasantly surprised. Our room was cosy, clean and had a old heritage feel about it. We watched the sunset from the terrace directly outside of our room which had a fantastic view. Friendly staff and loved the fact we were told ""we don't believe in menu's"". We could order what we liked and it was cooked for us using ingredients from the nearby organic farm. This was refreshing after a week of soulless hotels providing the same buffet food. Highly recommend this charming resort. ",Stefanie R,/Profile/143stefanier,,40
