tehri-gharwal,"The Yog Niketan hotel is well situated near Ram Juhla with unique acces from a quiet and beautiful garden directly to Ganges.   There is a small yogahall with daily morning classes. Ayurvedic treatments are also available.  Restaurant is in the basement (no view) with only a few tables. It serve meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner. (Be aware that only very few guests can be seated for a meal at the same time)   Food and rooms are quite overprized in regards to its quality and other options in the area.  Rooms in the basement are noisy when the dining area is busy. (U will be able to hear all conversations)  Beddings and towels are clean. Bathrooms so so. Staff is friendly.   I booked three rooms out of which two had such bad smell and poor air that all guest woke up with",CDjourney,/Profile/cdjourney,"Copenhagen, Denmark",30
tehri-gharwal,"Yog Niketan is by far the the best hotel in Rishikesh, in every respect. Situated right by the Ganges, the property is wonderfully aesthetic and has almost everything going for it - clean, reasonably sized rooms, entirely central (walking distance from Ram Jhula) and staffed with very hospitable executives. There are not many rooms, so its suggested that the reservation be done well in advance if you want to stay here.  Highly recommended!",ShipSam,/Profile/ShipSam,"Mumbai, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"We arrived early morning so our room wasn’t ready. The receptionist invited us for the breakfast....... OMG!!!! There was not a single thing that worth to be mention as good. The smell of the food, the absence of cleanliness of the room, the ambience, all was just horrible. We decided to left immediately to find another hotel although we had already payed for this one.

tehri-gharwal,I would definitely recommend this hotel for travellers to Rishikesh. Very good hospitality and the view of river Ganga simply awesome. Mr. Santosh Shah in the canteen and Mr Santosh Bandooni at the reception we’re very helpful. A great place to stay.,sumanmkhrj,/Profile/sumanmkhrj,"Chandigarh, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"One of the nicest place to stay in rishikesh the hotel boasts a beautiful view of Ganga, the staff are helpful and professional, they have a nice restaurant which serves good food. Location is great, near ram jhula, across parmarth ghat and near triveni ghat. Had a very nice stay there",rcallikan,/Profile/rcallikan,Curepipe,40
tehri-gharwal,"We booked 3 rooms between 08th-10th Nov. In one of the rooms, shower didn't work and there was no hot water. In the second room, jet/sprinkler in the washroom didn't work. All in all 2 out of 3 rooms had issues. The only good thing about this property was its location. Even the kitchen service was extremely poor, staff could not manage 15 guests at one time., even during breakfast buffet where one would expect food is readily available. Average wait time for food to be served was 30 mins.   The most disappointing part was that our cars were parked right in front of their reception and car logo was stolen by someone. When we asked for the CCTV footage, first we were advised camera placed outside didn't work and later we were told it works but they will send the recording to us",Maps26661617875,/Profile/Maps26661617875,,20
