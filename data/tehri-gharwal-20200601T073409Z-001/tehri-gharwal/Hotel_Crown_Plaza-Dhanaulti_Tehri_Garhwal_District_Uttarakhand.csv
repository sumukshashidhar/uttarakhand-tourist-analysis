tehri-gharwal,I stayed in this hotel for 2 days on 26th - 27th Jan and booked 2 rooms. Most of the time electricity wasn't there and they didn't turn on generators. No hot water was available as geysers weren't working. Food was OK. However staff was very friendly & ready to help. Most of the time we were out of the hotel for sightseeing therefore i didn't impact much to us but for families its not recommended to stay in this hotel.,Shakun S,/Profile/ShakunS14,,20
tehri-gharwal,Hotel is ok with a beautiful view of hills. The food is pretty good. Although the place was covered with snow all over so it was quite challenging to do any activity. Will suggest this place for a night stay only .,Shipra U,/Profile/shiprau,,30
tehri-gharwal,"Hotel is good, but not Deluxe quality. There are nothing special to see in Dhanaulti. Public communication is very poor. Crown Plaza is only good hotel to stay nearby echo parks. Owner is very good and supportive.",imrituraj,/Profile/imrituraj,"New Delhi, India",30
tehri-gharwal,I visited dhanaulti very recently 27-30 june 2915 and below are the pros n cons about hotel crown plaza. We booked 3 rooms for three families.  Pros:-  1. Very cooperative hotel staff. 2. Rooms with all basic amenities. 3. Snacks in food are good in taste.  Cons:- 1. Spiders welcome you in washrooms and other insects in rooms. 2. Food prepared in very unhygienic conditions. 3. Get ready for stomach infections if you eat in this hotel. 4. Rooms n washrooms lags cleanliness and there is odour/ bad smell in rooms all the times.  Dhanolti in itself  is a beautiful hill station to stay n enjoy but lags very basic facilities like hospital etc. Avoid going Dhanolti if you have children under age 5.,Deepak C,/Profile/DeepakC817,,20
tehri-gharwal,Overall average hotel. Staff crunch is there and there is delay in delivery if you order something. We have been given ground floor deluxe room and in front of our window which was having outside.. has been allotted to visitors vehicle and driver. We couldn't see the outside beauty during our 2 days stay in hotel due to this and there was no action in spite of assurance given to us. Staff behavior is very good. Bedsheets were not so good and faded in hotel's best room (Deluxe Room). Food served is also average except Pahaadi Daal. Pahaadi Daal is the best memory of the hotel along with the staff behavior.,rudresh_leo,/Profile/rudresh_leo,"New Delhi, India",30
tehri-gharwal,We went there in June which is the peak season... Nice hotel ans there are not much options on the way. Ample parking space.... Staff was helpful and friendly... Hotel manager was also kind and helped whenever needed. Clean rooms. Though the view is not that nice from all the rooms so be specific when u opt.,Amit M,/Profile/256amitm,,40
tehri-gharwal,"Dhanaulti is a pretty small hill station and Crowns Plaza lies almost in the middle of the city. Contrary to the name, the rooms are anything but a luxurious hotel one. The beds were not very clean and same was with washrooms. However the way we got stuck there in 4 feet snow, we needed some great help from the localities, and that was excellenly provided by the hotel staff. ",Saumya D,/Profile/travindian,,30
tehri-gharwal,"its always wonderful when u r with someone u love the most bt a serene place like dhanaulti situated in the lap of nature makes the surroundings more adorable.. well i know m digressing bt its true the place is very BEAUTIFUL,cool n far better than the noisy road of mussorie.. me n my better half stayed here at CROWN PLAZA on the first floor.. the room was a standard one with old furniture bt the service n food was very very nice.. my paramour just loved it.. the pine forest view from the hotel was very soothing n gives u a relaxing experience.. the staff n manager were cordial n ill once again mention about the delectable food..THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THERE IS NO ATM FACILITY IN DHANAULTI SO U BETTER CARRY CASH WITH U.. THANK GOD MY FRIEND WAS HAVING CASH WITH HER",DIVNEETI,/Profile/DIVNEETI,"Dehradun, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"We have been there on 24th noon, we tired so take room there, as my family members starts complaining about bad smell, poor service, poor bedding, unhygenic surrounding and arrogant staff. My family decided to shift to another hotel after this circumstances.they said will charge Rs 3000 for 2 room in ground floor (right to reception), and i gave them 1000 as an advance. as we make up our mind to shift then we ask to return our advance, staff arrogantly says its not possible to return an advance. i make up my mood so i said ok, i dont need my advance back but they still says its not possible you need to pay full amount i.e. 3000. after arguments we have to pay 500 more to hotel, so ultimately gave 1500 for couple of minutes. the hotel staff were drunked and not even help us to",Bhupendr3,/Profile/Bhupendr3,"Delhi, Delhi, India",10
tehri-gharwal,"First of all, Frankly speaking, if you are visiting Dhanaulti you have to stay in ECO Park cottages to enjoy the lush Alpine jungles for which Dhanaulti is actually famous for. Staying in any other hotel would be give 'n' take almost a same bet.  Talking about Crown Plaza  - Running hot water,  - TV with Tata Sky,  - Good view. Prefer the rooms with front view, though they do not have a balcony but still it provides a spectacular view of Alpine Trees. - Not so bad food especially omellete  Now the things that i didn't like - - Hospitality is good but sometimes it is too much. Staff can be over pursuasive for ordering the food. - To many spiders inside the bathroom and yes i was scared.  - Bathroom vents open in rooms ally and this is especially the thing i don't like about the",planetexpl0rer,/Profile/planetexpl0rer,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",30
