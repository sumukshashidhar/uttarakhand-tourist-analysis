tehri-gharwal,"We stayed in nov,pros are the location, food is ok not much variety to choose,  they have special menu from 5pm to 8pm which was never available (atleast on my days during the stay of 2 nights)  Cons.  Well a lot,  first and formost ,while booking was offered 15 min massage complimentory which was not provided, and some lame excuse given that the offer was from the website and not them.  Pls check there own web site which offers the same, but was not honoured.  Moat important, they charge u for heater per day 300rs min.  Which is not mentioned anywhere on the website or elsewhere.  Who charges for room heaters in peak winter season?  The excuse they give is, we work on low cost airline pattern,  every thing is chargable and extra,. Sir,  even low cost carriers have chrges",Rishi,/Profile/rishi1976,,10
tehri-gharwal,"Kastura is a  decent hotel. The rooms are quite basic but clean, neat and tidy. Very good attitude of the staffs. Nice view of the pine and deodar forest as well as snow peaks. From the hotel you can see the Surkanda Devi temple also. Was lucky to have a room with nice view all around. Mr. Mani, Mr. Praveen along with their staffs took good care of us. Awesome taste of the foods at a reasonable price and a prompt service. But the challenge is now for the management to sustain the cleanness, service of the rooms and hotel.  Tourists who are old and who have asthmatic tendency may avoid staying here as there are around 50 steps from the road ( quite steep ) to reach the hotel. The rooms also can be improved upon. Room heater was provided at an extra charge. We enjoyed our stay",buk15,/Profile/buk15,,40
tehri-gharwal,"We stayed here with family friends for two nights. Hotel is nicely maintained and clean. It offers amazing view of surrounding mountains, in morning time you can see Himalaya ranges located at far, it was quite good and relaxing break from urban lifestyle. Hotel staff was courteous and provided good service.   Food was also good, except our dinner on second night was quite disappointing, whatever items we ordered one came with too much of chillies, other came with too much of salt and one came with no taste at all. We could see hotel staff carrying food for room services numerous times which meant kitchen was busy, but that spoilt our taste. Otherwise we enjoyed our stay, can surely recommend others.",mitesh_parekh,/Profile/mitesh_parekh,"Mumbai, India",40
tehri-gharwal,The location is beautiful. The dinner was lip-smacking. The breakfast is basic but good. The rooms could have been better! They are too close - you can hear everything from the room next to your. Do not go for the back room as they have a blocked view.,VijayaSShetty,/Profile/VijayaSShetty,"Pune, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"Hotel Co-Owner (Karthick) was too arrogant, rude & mis-behaved with my wife.  For a pity reason, on second day early morning, he started shouting without even realizing that he was talking to a lady guest in-front of her two small kids. It was too humiliating an experience and Mr. Gargash & whole staff was just a mute spectator there.  If somebody wants to spoil their mood while on a vacation, then this is the best place to visit.  Till date, they haven't e-mailed-us the hotel stay and food invoices against their promise to provide same date evening after check-out.",Yashu G,/Profile/540yashug,"Ghaziabad, India",10

tehri-gharwal,"Kastura Resort  is one of the best place to stay in kanatal. The view from the hotel was majestic. The hotel was also very neat and clean. the staffs behavior was also very good. it is the only  ayurvedic spa resort in kanatal. We arrived the resort early but the owner of the hotel greeted us so well and has given us some ayurvedic medicines for relaxation. he asked us to enjoy the sun  and the lovely green mountain views at the roof top. The sun was warm but the wind was nice cold. This kind of behavior brought us back to the resort. The good thing is that you can also go to the famous surkunda devi temple by tracking. It was our best visit. After my first visit I tried to book rooms for 2 days but due to different room type availability, I have to rebook other room.

tehri-gharwal,"Hotel Kastura is a great choice if you're looking for a hotel in kanatal. It has an excellent location, looking over the mountains. The rooms are really comfortable with great bedding.they also provide a hater as it can get extremely cold. the hotel has a sort of common elevated balcony which overlooks the valley and mountains and is also an amazing spot to watch the sunrise or sunset. as this hotel has been opened just 6 months back, the service has to be more organized. but this can be overlooked as the owner is extremely warm and will look after your stay. great option for a hotel in Kanatal!",nupurdatar,/Profile/nupurdatar,"Mumbai, India",40
