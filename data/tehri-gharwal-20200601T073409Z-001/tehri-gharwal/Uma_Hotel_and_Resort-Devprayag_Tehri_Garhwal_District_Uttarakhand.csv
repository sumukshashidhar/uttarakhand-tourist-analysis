tehri-gharwal,"two years ago this hotel oued to be one of the best. but last month when i went there, i saw a polar opposite side. it has lost its charm and beauty. everything is dirty. the worker kuldeep is an idiot who does not help at all. speaks rudely but the owner does not interfere. on the whole a bad choice. good for peoeple on a budget.",Rahul G,/Profile/RahulG2323,"New Delhi, India",10
tehri-gharwal,This Hotel is located bang on the Highway if you are travelling from Rishikesh to RudraPrayag and passing through DevPrayag.The rooms are clean and comfortable with awesome view of the Sangam (Bhagirathi + Alaknada).The Hotel also has a restaurant attached.I will always recommend this hotel if someone wants to stay in DevPrayag. We had a comfortable night here while driving back to Delhi after Kedarnath Darshan.,anjan s,/Profile/18anjans,"Raipur, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"good hotel. clean sheets. hot water,¬† very obliging and good staff. good food..especially their parathas. easy booking process. view of the confluence of Alaknanda and Bhageerathi which forms the Ganges from balcony of all rooms. Approximately 1km drive on the main road where we park the car and walk down small alleys, cross the bridge across river¬† bagirathi,¬† climb down a flight of steps to reach the confluence.¬†This would be a problem for very old people who cannot walk.  would definitely recommend to others.  ¬†",savvy222,/Profile/savvy222,"Erode, India",50

tehri-gharwal,Alaknanda and Bhagirathi joins together to become Ganga. This prayag is considered very important in terms of pitra daan (last rituals). You can see the 2 different colours of river mixing together at this prayag.  ,SISHUTOSH,/Profile/SISHUTOSH,"New Delhi, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"i generally stay at Ramkund resort but stayed in this hotel as ramkund was fully occupied. contrary to my expectations the hotel is very good and clean. although a budget hotel, it has everything a tourist needs. clean, peaceful with a panoramic view. food excellent. all well there",rahulgautam,/Profile/rahulgautam,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"Well we had no other choice but to hold our journey to Auli at Devprayag, as it was getting late (6 PM) and also there was a cloud burst reported ahead... while there happens to be a good 3 star resort, but one may find it booked because of being the only best option in the area...  in worst possibility and in case of no other option available, considering driving is allowed only upto 8 PM, if you are nearby Devprayag, you can stay at UMA Hotel as a night stay over... the AC rooms are OK / neat & clean and provide river facing views..  helpful staff and good room service... food provided is also okay...   the charges for AC room will be between Rs 2000-2200 per night... don't expect any exceptional service",Harsh Singh,/Profile/HarshSingh82,"New Delhi, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"We used it as a stopover on the way back from hills to Delhi. We could not find mention of many hotels in Devprayag as it is not such a tourist destination, based on the on-line ratings of this hotel we selected it.  It is a decent hotel with few AC room, which are clean and adequately big. Bathroom was clean, with running water.  Best part is the view of the ganga river from the balcony/corridor.   I believe it a good choice for a stopover/short stay",Gaurav A,/Profile/gaurava849,"New Delhi, India",40
