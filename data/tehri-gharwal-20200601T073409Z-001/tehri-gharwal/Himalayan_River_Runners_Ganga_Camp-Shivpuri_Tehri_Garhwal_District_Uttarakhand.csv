tehri-gharwal,"I stayed with the Himalayan Hideaway Lodge which is a sister concern and did the white water rafting with the Himalayan River Runners crew. It was the experience of a lifetime. They are great professionals, very friendly and very customer centric. I did a 21km stretch and had the time of my life. I had an amazing group of people with me on the raft and did body surfing in the rapids despite not knowing how to swim. Thats how comfortable these guys make you feel. A must do while in Rishikesh :)",SameerMan,/Profile/SameerMan,"Mumbai, India",50
tehri-gharwal,We went in Nov 2013....and it was one of the best decisions we could have made...the entire staff right from Ram...to everyone involved were extremely caring and attentive....  The tents were comfortable and faced the emerald waters of Gangaji....we had an amazing view of the mountains on the opposite of the river....we managed to see loads of kakar or barking deer....we sadly managed to see only the paw marks of the leopard near our camp which was still very exciting...  All the instructors were amazing...they had excellent knowledge of the rapids and made us feel comfortable right away...we had a great time rafting with them as instructors...  The food was really delicious....since we went in November which is the off-season...we had the camp to ourselves..and though it was,ubertraveler2016,/Profile/ubertraveler2016,India,50
tehri-gharwal,"More than these tents, what anyone would like the most would be the ambience, calmness n beautiful n majestic river Ganga.  The food is average, people who prefer drinks on such trips are advised to keep their quota n a good fridge to keep drinks cool.  All tents are the same, so don't expect too many things...  What one should look for are the outdoor activities that one can club in the deal.  Best time is Apr-Jun when water is crystal clear.  Do try 17 km rafting n cliff jumping during the rafting at Maggi point..  ",sharmamanish,/Profile/sharmamanish,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
tehri-gharwal,The rafting was great. We had been told this company has the highest safety standards and everything seemed good. The guide was excellent.  We have been rafting quite a few times and he was the most entertaining guide we have ever had. He had many games organized between rapids and really made the activity a highlight of our trip! He had a great sense of humour and entertained us all the way.  Definitely highly recommended.,Joanna1010,/Profile/Joanna1010,"Brisbane, Australia",50

tehri-gharwal,"We visiting this place in 1st week of May. We were a group of 4 and did not stay in the camp. We just did the rafting. My experience   - very beautiful and well maintained camp - extremely professional and well trained staff. We were doing rafting for the 1st time and the detailed instructions and friendly attitude gave the the much needed confidence  - the safety procedures were explained in great detail to us. Minor details like canoe in front was reassuring. Specially after so much news on accidents in this area.   - We had lunch in the camp. Simple but hot n tasty.   - last and the most important....the whole rafting experience was super fun. The Rapids, experience of jumping in the Ganges and floating was surreal.  All in all, highly recommended! Go for it. ",rakesh,/Profile/rakeshg29,"Bengaluru, India",50

A very friendly and smiley HRR crew,from the Booking Office, to the River Guides to the Drivers to the Cooks all were more than happy to help with any request ! Our family was well looked after and the children had a wonderful time. Delicious home style food, much appreciated by the healthy appetites created by the fresh air and fun exertions on the river as we paddled the rapids.The River Guides are well experienced, very safety conscious and clear with their instructions...we were in good hands through out.A high point was the sharing of  each one's experience and memory of the various rapids en route as we sat around the bonfire.A highly recommended adventure holiday.",611jan,/Profile/611jan,"Pune, India",50

Very clean facilities and beach could rival the best beaches in Europe.  Kids had a blast and wanted to live there forever.  Can't rate it highly enough!

tehri-gharwal,"We landed up at HRR camp on recommendation of a running group that we were participating in a half marathon with in Rishikesh. We were pleasantly surprised when we landed up at the camp. To our complete surprise, the camp was extremely clean, well managed and had very helpful and well trained staff. We were given a download of 'rules of the camp' that included helping in keeping the camp clean and hygienic. The camp is probably on the largest beach in Rishikesh and the tents are well spaced out. The food is simple and close to home cooked food in taste. The tents have a simple layout with 2 single bed and 2 chairs. They open onto pristine views of the Ganges and the hills beyond.

We were travelling with a group and the experience was enjoyable for everyone. The tents are well done, the location is awesome, you feel you are in a little paradise. Food is good and varied if you take into consideration the local constraints (some meals are indian cuisine and some are western food). Dry toilets and built-up showers are also well done for such a location.  Rafting activity is well organised, in a professional and safe way.  One little thing, persons travelling there should be able to walk down the road on a little path (fit and with proper shoes).

tehri-gharwal,"I loved my two nights at HRR's Ganga Camp! It was quiet, staff are friendly, the location is amazing, food was good. All of us were treated like old friends. The rafting is a LOT of fun. I repeat, it was quiet. Prices are a bit higher to help keep some of the crowds away. The camp focuses on quality rather than on quantity. It was the right place for us this past week...and I hope to be back next year.",fozjon,/Profile/fozjon,"Patna, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"I stayed here with a group of friends (see Wendy F's review below) in March 2014. HRR is one of the oldest and most established camps on this stretch of river. Their safety record on the river is second to none. Their facilities are comfortable, the food always freshly prepared, simple but delicious (we had rotis hot off the tandoor, for example), the guides very experienced. Tea and coffee are served at regular intervals. I cannot understand those reviewers who say the staff are arrogant. I didn't see an iota of it, on the contrary some of the other guests were pretty badly behaved in terms of not bothering to clear their own plates, leaving their possessions scattered around, not leaving tips etc. If you are planning to go rafting, you won't go wrong with HRR.",needbe,/Profile/needbe,Dorset,50
tehri-gharwal,As part of a  group of four women I spent 4 nights with this organization. Two nights on the beach with two rafting experiences both up and down stream. The facilities and food were fabulous and the guiding staff professional and fun. The two day trek in the foothills was amazing with an experienced and friendly guide and porters that managed to produce amazing food on a small gas ring. Even a toilet tent! The adventure was even more magical as we did not meet any other walkers just local people going about their life. The last night in the lodge was also very comfortable and relaxing with delicious food. I cannot fault this company or their staff.,Wendy F,/Profile/wendyf46,"Perth, Australia",50

The camp was peaceful, comfortable and pristine.  Initially hesitant to be 'campling' in India, we were wonderfully surprised to find this camp an oasis from the usual noise, chaos and pollution.  The camp has an extremely private, long, wide and open beachfront at the foot of the Himalayas with powder soft white sand....there was no need to wear shoes for the whole 4 days.  The tents were basic but comfortable, and the outdoor showers and dry-pit toilets were extremely clean.

It has one of the largest beaches that any such camp in that belt has. They have around 45 odd tents, 2 volleyball playing areas and 2 badminton nets along with tyre activities and rope balancing in thier property. They serve excellent food - breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks...fresh and tasty in the dinning area. The tents do not have electricity and you have to manage with candles !! what an experience.

Unlike most travelers, I had walked all the way from the point where the rafting campsites begin in Shivpuri; so I had seen almost all the rafting campsites on the river-bank. The moment I reached the Himalayan River Runners (HRR) Campsite, I was thrilled to realise that I had booked the most beautiful campsite amongst all ! I had connected with a few other companies, but none seemed as professional & prompt as Moi Tensing from HRR.   The next 3 days were without a doubt the best adventure holiday I have ever had. The Kayaking and rafting trips were unbelievable. And nothing, just nothing beats jumping from your raft into the gushing waters of the holy Ganga and float with the flow.

From the rafting perspective I am looking forward to doing a longer (multi-day) trip with them as they seem super professional. The river is busy these days (I first rafted this stretch in 1994!) and we saw boats going past absolutely packed with people, so dangerous! Also we were the only boat we saw with a safety kayaker. Even on a reasonably tame stretch of river like Shivpuri to Lakshman Jhula accidents can happen and many Indians are non-swimmers so sending rafts out without a kayaker seemed like a really bad idea to me.
