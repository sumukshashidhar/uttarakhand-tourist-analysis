tehri-gharwal,"Along with my friends and family we visited the place on 26th Dec. However we had a terrible experience. Calling it a resort would be too generous as these are just bamboo huts covered with tents which has enough space for rodents to pass through.  The place in general was dirty and dingy with broken sanitary hard wares , dustbins which looked as fir never cleaned. Trash lying all over.  Although there were some huts which were not occupied when we checked in however we were denied those huts on the pretext that they have been allotted to someone else. Food was average. Bonfire was just for name sake which was not enough to accommodate all the guests. Huts were dark, cramped and dingy. I would rather recommend camp carnival (similar rates but better service) just next to this",Ashwin S,/Profile/ashwinsahay,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",20
tehri-gharwal,"Please understand, they don't be any parking, they make you park on road or someone else's private property, though Mr. Jitu tries to make things good for you but there is a guy Raqib who tries to be smart. The location is average. No view from property. It's better to book property on the valley side, it's located on hill side covered by trees so no view is clear. Food was good, the cook Mr. Virender cooked good sweet dish. The water pipe was broken, despite reminding them of it for 5 times, it didn't occur to em to mend it unless it was 4.30am in the morning when we had to leave. Good thing about property was food, music. Mr. Jitu was of great help. Thanks to him. ",Puneet Arora,/Profile/drpuneetarora,"New Delhi, India",30

tehri-gharwal,"It was a very amazing experience. To all the travellers looking for a hygienic washroom and rooms, this is the right place for you. Even though it was a tent, the hygiene part was not a problem. The food quality was very good and there wasn't anything to complaint about that. The staff there was amazing. Very cooperative and fun as well. The owner was personally interacting with everyone and provided us with everything we might need later without us asking for it. So all.in all I recommend you to just blindly book the resort if at all travelling to Kanatal.",Ishaaa,/Profile/Ishatheprincess,,50
tehri-gharwal,"Enjoyed staying in Himalayan Roots. Rooms are a bit compact but food was good and evening bonfire was fun. The host Mr. Sachin was helpful too.The activities like zipline, burma bridge etc were good also though the safety measures and the people managing these activities need to be more professional in their approach as their criteria seem to be only getting more customers.",Rishu18,/Profile/rishu18,Mumbai,40

tehri-gharwal,"We enjoyed our stay at the property. Property location is good. Our host mr Sachin is a nice person,he take careâ€™s of every requirement of the guest. They have proper arrangement for music , sitting , outdoor games , bonfire, generators (for electricity backup)  One more thing food quality is outstanding. Cottages have good space, they are renovating these right now..  only outdoor lighting of the property is not adequate, they need to improve a bit..  Keep it up  I would surely visit this place again. And suggest my friends to stay there..",Prateek Jindal,/Profile/Prateek1606,"New Delhi, India",50

tehri-gharwal,"I visited himalayan roots, kanatal with four of my friends during my holidays. I work as a software engineer and got very few holidays. So I visited this resort with my friends and their services surpassed my expectations. Resort's staff is very supportive and friendly nature. The food and refreshment items are delicious and of finest quality. Kanatal's weather is cheerful. Me and my friends highly enjoyed adventurous activities such as zipline, skybridge, forest-trekking. I dearly recommend this place and resort for everyone's holiday's plan......  '",VIbhanshu,/Profile/vigozworld,,50

tehri-gharwal,"Worst-ever experience, Terrible time spent there during my holidays on long weekend (30 Sep to 2 Oct 2017)... The pictures shown on portals/website are 5 years old.... the huts are not green anymore...  Management & Service are intolerable , the Manager- Aviral was unable to handle any query/complaint raised by Guests....and the so called GM-Sales/Owner- Vivek lal, he is really nice guy.... he takes you to your dream place while discussing on phone/emails.... but when you will check-in there, you will only get disappointment....   I was suggested to adjust 4 people in 1 cottage due to unavailability of cottage and later i get to know he tried the same trick in order to manage 16 peoples in 4 cottages...  My cottage was having issues like Broken Hasp/lock on the door, Broken",Vishal G,/Profile/VishalG98,,10
tehri-gharwal,I went there on my bike as I love this place. This is a kind of place to getaway from heat and traffic in the mid of summers  especially if the camps and the camping sites are good.  This camp is located at its best place where you can see the himalayas  just sitting on a chair with having tea and snacks.  Cottages are good but not luxurious.  Food quality good.  They also provide various outdoor adventerous activities if anyone wants to participate.  Overall rating goes to 4. ,manu n,/Profile/81manun,,40
tehri-gharwal,"Awesome team and great accommodation   It's located at main chamba mussorie road ,the camp is really beautiful. Great food and hospitality.

tehri-gharwal,"No words to describe the place its awesome ,its my second visit to this place .last time I visited with couple of my friends ,found it good . So Got courage again to let my entire team literary forced by me ,for shifting from usual heated rishikesh rafting  nd all dats wat my team have been doing till now ) But it turned out to be the most adventurous trip for us , Everything was perfect  except few things, which ill mention later Food Was good, Toilets were unexpectedly clean, infact much more than we can expect in Camping,(tiles,working flush, hot water supply ) Overall Himalayn roots made our trip succesfull,  Thanks to the entire staff  for making our tour a memorable one  Few things which should be taken care off,  Dj night timings should be more , and in breakfast more",pancchi s,/Profile/pancchis,,40
tehri-gharwal,"I went to Kanatal in September last year for the campfest organized by them. It was my first experience of going in the hills with the group of 80 odd people who were pretty excited about this new concept of watching an open air cinema with adventure activities like trekking, zipe line and Sky walk. In addition to that to our surprise there were food stalls offering delicious food items with great variety apart from the cottage food which was equally good. In addition to adventure activities we were treated with some great music, played by DJs and as well as by some talented acoustic guitar players near the bonfire. The venue itself was pretty beautiful, there were lush green mountains all around us and we could see the clouds just below us. The way to trek was also pretty",Anuj J,/Profile/732anujj,,50
tehri-gharwal,"First time i visit the Himalayan roots in august and it was great experience, the place kanatal which is situated in uttarakhand near chamba district was very beautiful, climate is very pleasant and clouds are always up to your head and the kodia Forrest trek was mesmerizing, food was very very tasty and the organizers are too cool. i m looking forward for their upcoming event and love to join every time i got a chance.",sahilgr8,/Profile/sahilgr8,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",50
