tehri-gharwal,The food is good. The service is good. The location has no parallel. The general manager is so intensely involved that the difference between him or any other worker at the place disappears. I have visited this place twice. Once in Nov 2019 and another in the last week of Dec 2019. Those who seek some spiritual diving must visit this place. I took a group of my students there and also were able to do good recordings there.,Dinesh Kumar,/Profile/Upanishads,"New Delhi, India",50

It is a beautiful location on a hill top but the property maintainance and upkeep requires improvement. We had to change the first room which was given to us due to number of defects in it. The second room was only marginally better but we decided to adjust rather than change again. The standard reply to a food order is "" Bahut time lagega"". It did not seem that the servers were keen to serve. The food however was good for breakfast and Dinner. For the price that they charge, they need to improve product and service both.

The deluxe rooms on 3rd floor were simple but comfortable. An extra blanket could have made the stay more comfortable as temperatures drop in wee hours of night. Rooms have blowers though but not sufficient for the cold. Food was really nice, particularly vegetarian ones. Day-time outdoor seating is available for breakfast /lunch, which is really nice. But their 1st floor seating area is not heated. At night the chill makes the food go cold in a matter of minutes.  They have a nice games area where only the snooker table is well maintained.

The service is pathetic with staff mostly untrained, though they try to do their best within their limitations.

tehri-gharwal,"Its a serene place away from the hustle of the crowds, the rooms on the first floor are avoidable as they are crampy, make sure you book a room on the ground floor which is a premium room with a slight extra cost but worth the deal. The ground floor rooms have access to a small play area/ lawn which has a pleasant view of the valley below.  The food is excellent, although they had suggested a buffet earlier, but you can order anything on the menu as alacarte. Although we didnt get the variety of a buffet but got sufficient variety through alacarte also.  Beautiful flowers and garden in front, side and back.  The swimming pool was out of commission which was a little disappointing but since it was rainy season, there was not much neither we or the management could do about it.

tehri-gharwal,"Booked the place, for one night with family in december. Got some discount as it was a complete off season and there was nobody accept us, which was actually the best part of the stay. The tariffs displayed were almost same as was there on the various sites. I had 5 rooms for one night. None of the 5 rooms were exactly same. So if u r paying the full price then u will miss the fineness of a hotel which u will expect if u r paying 9000 INR. U have to ignore few things to make it a good holiday. the restaurant was good although not luxurious. the hotel property is very big but as it is on a hill top, everything is on various terraces.

tehri-gharwal,"We drove from Delhi to Chamba and it took us almost 9 hrs to reach the hotel. We spent 4 days here. The location of the property and the view from here ... amazing ... as the name suggests "" hilltop "", but that by far was the only good thing. Food, service, deluxe rooms, everything was out just about ok nothing worth writing about and the staff was ... not motivated to serve you better .... or I'd say no smiling faces just grumpy guys who serve with a ""yes sir"" attitude. It still is the best hotel/resort in Chamba, Uttarakhand .  We also told them to put up more signboards that may help in locating the Hotel easily. As of now one is bound to miss the sharp left climb that leads to the hotel.... some of the people in our group did miss the turn.

tehri-gharwal,"I had stayed one night at this Resort in January 2013. The resort is located peacefully between chamba and dhanaulti, the location is really good although one might miss the road that leads to the hotel. So if you are driving from Dhanaulti, ensure you keep a look out for the steep cement road to the hotel around 1.5-2km before reaching Chamba.   The room rent seemed a bit on the higher side, we had booked a double room for 7000. The food was decent but nothing great.    The best part of the hotel is its view and the location. If you are on a honeymoon or want a quite time, this might be a good destination.   The hotel didn't have a Swipe machine for credit cards/debit cards which is a pain since you have to go to Chamba to withdraw cash.

tehri-gharwal,"If anyone looking for peace and tranquility, this is the place to come. The location of the hotel is such that you experience the sunrise on the Snow peaked mountains as well as the sunset in the valley. The property has a lot of space and you can easily find your own little quite corner incase you have some noisy guests around. The scenery is beautiful enough to bring out the poet or the painter or the writer or any other artistic talent in you. And if not that doesnt happen then all u need is hot coffee from the hotel and a good book to give u company. The hospitality of the hotel is good. There food is tasty. I would recommend it to anyone just because of its location.",Sumedha G,/Profile/393sumedhag,"Delhi, Delhi, India",50

We landed at the Classic Hill Top, with no reservation and no prior contact with them. Staff at the Hotel were extremely kind and warm and put us in a room, despite being heavily booked (it was the peak tourist season.)

tehri-gharwal,Unfortunately I did not have a favorable experience as some of these other reviewers-in fact I had to double check that they were describing the place I stayed at.  The location is quite scenic and that is the ONLY plus. There was no heat in the hotel the time I was there. My in room heater didn't even have a plug. Guests were bundled up in the dining room. All requests for anything were slow in coming or ignored. And to top it off I got very ill from their food-causing two days of bedrest at subsequent hotels. Another patron of the restaurant also got sick I discovered later. The power continually went off throughout my stay. The staff couldn't give be bothered to respond half the time and should probably find another line of work that suits them.

tehri-gharwal,"Excellent resort. Best part of the deal..Their ample parking space, swimming pool at the hill top and the fact that you don't have to do anything except laze around the pool. It is a complete weekend package. Whenever I am thinking about a weekend getaway in the hills, I get worried about the parking for my car and the driving around on the narrow streets of a hill station. Well, once you reach here. You are done. No more trips to packed streets or joustling with crowds. It's location is it's USP..Away from the maddening crowds. You have a nice pool, a gaming room for kids, excellent pool and a decent Spa. 7 hours away from Delhi, makes it a really worthwhile trip.

The resort itself offers a lot of fun activities like swimming, games, swings,billiards and all. The food quality and service is good. The rooms are clean and airy with a lovely view. I would recommend this place for large groups. Keep in mind that it is located in a secluded place and there are no big markets or mall road nearby but the resort itself offers u a lot lot to be occupied. Not to forget they also have a small library that overlooks the hills and a glass house that offers the most spectacular views during rains.

On one side the view from the hotel is the amazing peaks of gagngotri and yamnotri and on the other you can see a far stretched valley leading to rishikesh.

The resort also has its own pool and billiards club with a full fledged spa. We took a couples package which included a jacuzzi and a massage each. Getting a massage in such a place is the most relaxing experience ever as from the massage room you can smell the pine and once you are done you need to get into the traffic of the city.

The rooms are fairly clean, though maintenance leaves some more to be desired (cracked washbasin for one, jamming lock of main door for another - though the lock issue was taken care of promptly by them).
