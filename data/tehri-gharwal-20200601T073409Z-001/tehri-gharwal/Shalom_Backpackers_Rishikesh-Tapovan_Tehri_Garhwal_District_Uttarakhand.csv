tehri-gharwal,I was in a four bed dorm here. The view from the balcony of the Ganga is perfect.  The cafe is a nice space to meet people and also with its own good views.   People tend to extend their stay here!!!  Nice spot.,africatraveller15,/Profile/africatraveller15,"Zanzibar Archipelago, Tanzania",50
tehri-gharwal,"It was a little over lunch time when we reached the lane to l Laxman Jhula where all these cafe's are. We were originally planning to go to the much hyped about Beatles cafe just next door. But we found the vibe to be a little overhyped. So instead we went into this cafe which had an inviting bright yellow staircase.   Inside, the cafe was empty since most of the crowd had left after lunch. The interiors are cute, yellow with quirky intelligent phrases written all over. A nice Hindi mix was playing, soft. The staff was extremely polite. The best part was sitting next to the windows and enjoying the view of the river. The Hummus ans Pita was amazing, so was the Pasta. Oh and the filter coffee! ❤️  Definitely recommended.",Snehi S,/Profile/SnehiSingh94,"Dehradun, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"We came to rishikesh knowing nothing about the city and Shalom Backpackers was so hospitable and really took the time and effort to help us plan our journey with bus tickets, ideas, recommendations and more! We recommend this to everyone!",mkorf,/Profile/mkorf,Switzerland,50
tehri-gharwal,"Spent a night in this hostel and enjoyed every bit of it. I’m addicted to their masala chai. Also, check out the cafe and enjoy the view of the Ganga River. :) will definitely come back to this place.   This was my review the first time that we were there. We, returned because we were satisfied the first time. However, on our next visit, we were planning to go to Delhi the next morning. At 9am we asked for our laundry and the guy at the reception told us that it will be finished in an hour. After having our breakfast and lunch and nearly dinner at their cafe, which serve the food that day and hour after taking the order, we saw our laundry freshly hanged and very wet at 5pm. We could have told that the laundry wasn’t done and we would have gone but our time was wasted waiting",cathrine jane,/Profile/cathrinethejane,"Cork, Ireland",10
tehri-gharwal,"Slightly pricier than other hostels in the area, but the view of the Ganga is worth every rupees. I enjoyed my stay a lot, the staff was helpful and friendly. They even offered us a better room for the same price as the one we booked since it was free.",GuillaumeLed,/Profile/Guillaumeledoux,"Montreal, Canada",50
tehri-gharwal,"Amazing hostel. I felt at home as soon as I arrived at Shalom. The staff are absolutely fantastic- fun, friendly and helpful they're great for answering any queries you have or providing advice. The hostel itself has an incredible view that looks over the Ganges, with a nice cafe (selling tasty good value food) and a small terrace / garden as well. The dormitories are nice and air-conditioned.  A great hostel for meeting people. Couldn't recommend it enough. Thanks very much to the whole team- especially Rajesh and Ajay for making me feel so at home.   ",Tom N,/Profile/619tomn,,50
tehri-gharwal,"I stayed four days with my friends in this hostel and it was perfect. We met a lot of other travellers and had a lot of fun. The pool is really nice and the stuff is awesome. They really care about you and help you out with everything. Fortuitously we met a lot of people again who we met while travelling in other citys. It seems like this hostel is really popular and now I know why. Don't doubt, book it :)",Meli K,/Profile/MeliKrr,"Jodhpur, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"I along with 5 of my friends checked-in at Shalom Backpackers on 11th June. After we checked-In we experienced that AC and Fans are not working to their capacity and hence we communicated this at the reception. To which Mr. Prateek (Host) responded that there are electricity fluctuations in Rishikesh and hence they aren't working to their full capacity, but by late evening everything will be fine.  A few hours later at 11 pm when we arrived at the hostel, we found that the issue was still there.  This time also we communicated to Mr.Prateek to find a solution, but in return he said same lame reason ""That there is electricity fluctuations in the city and YOU CAN LOOK FOR OTHER PROPERTIES IF YOU WANT, I (Mr. PRATEEK) WILL REFUND YOU 2 NIGHTs MONEY""  Based on this  statement at",Nikhil Falnikar,/Profile/nikhilfalnikar,"Mumbai, India",10

tehri-gharwal,"I booked for two  nights and ended up staying over a week! The staff is really friendly and helpful, rooms clean, WiFi good(when the power wasn't off), yoga in the mornings was a nice touch. It could be a bit loud with people hanging out late at night though which was one of the only drawbacks for me.",alovelytravelgirl,/Profile/alovelytravelgirl,,40

tehri-gharwal,"We had an amazing stay at this hostel!! The staff went well above what was ever expected to help us out! They spent a long time helping us plan our route and book trains! We also needed to get to Delhi and he was already going there the next morning so gave us a free ride! So, so generous! There’s also a great view from the hostel, and it’s is a perfect location also!

tehri-gharwal,"I read a lot of great reviews about Shalom Rishikesh, in fact, it was promoised to be one of the best hostels in the town but I think most of the reviewers were foreigners, hence the amazing reviews.   First, I reached the hostel around 3:30 or 4:00 PM, it was so hot outside. As soon as I was done with the checkin formality I was told that I’ll be taken to my room. They told me it’s on the first floor and I said I’ll wait there, and I waited for 15 minutes but nobody came. I asked one of the guys in the cafe if they can help me with the room thing. They said the guys who checked you in is coming, but after waiting for 10 minutes nobody came. In fact, he got busy with the checkin process of another girl and took her to show the room (NOT ME WHO WAS WAITING FOR ALMOST 30 MINUTES).",Kiran Bisht,/Profile/Thedoikid,,30
tehri-gharwal,"My experience with this hostel was quite bad. There was a mouse in my room. They advised the price in Dollars but don’t accept it as a payment, which makes the prices higher because their rate is 68 rupies to one dollar. They tried charging me 80 rupies for a coffee that was actually 40 rupees. They charged 100 rupies for a locker that should cost you around 50 rupies max.  The food of the restaurant was bad",Rafael Braga,/Profile/Rafaelunderlinebraga,"Hyderabad, India",20
