tehri-gharwal,Visited Apple Orchid Country Resort in Jan'19. The scenic beauty was awesome and the hospitality was amazing. The best thing was that their pet dog showed us around the Orchard. The owner Mr. Suraj Rawat was very helpful and welcoming. Although I feel the linens and the towels and toiletries need to be better. The location is superb.,Vinita,/Profile/Offbeatlocation,,40

tehri-gharwal,"I went with my wife for a two night stay at this property. The choice was completely based on the reviews  on trip advisor. It seems that you cannot rely on Tripadvisor reviews any more .  The website of this property is  poor and it casted lots of doubt in my mind at the beginning itself.  On reaching  there , it took us time to find the property. There is only one board on the way and it does not indicate properly that you have to up climb the  slope. Your car will not go up the full height till the hotel door due to poor road condition.  The rooms were ill maintained  and not clean. The room lock  was not working properly.  The two boys Shuvam and Arvind were very active. The food was good. But on the last morning they were out of stock to make proper breakfast even.

tehri-gharwal,"We were finding a place which must be full of Nature.  And we found this place because we want to enjoy with our family and friends and no one should be there for disturbing.  This is the exact place we were searching.  Because apple country village resort is a small resort with 5-6 rooms and a secluded resort,  so we booked full resort for our family.  And finally we enjoyed a lot with bonfire,  apple garden,  Himalayan Views and of course the food.  Specially breakfast in the apple garden.
