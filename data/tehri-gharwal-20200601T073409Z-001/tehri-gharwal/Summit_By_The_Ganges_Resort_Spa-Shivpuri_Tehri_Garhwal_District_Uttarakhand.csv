Smart spacious room, clean and crisp, fresh.  the view of the outside swept us off our feet and we couldn't stop smiling till we checked out.   The dining room was huge and we could enjoy our meal in privacy and quiet in spite of many others being there.  The staff was well trained, knowledgeable  and smiling.

Rooms are over priced, balcony one are good to get a direct view of river, however, you cannot use balcony because of monkey presence. Also, these are not available for club mahindra members. Rooms are big enough and clean. Rooms without balcony looks clumsy and does not offer any view either, these are the ones which are available for club mahindra members. They give 15% flat discount on food bills, irrespective of club mahindra member or not. I wonder, why club mahindra has tied up with this resort as you feel like you are isolated in a small room and other rooms are great which are not with mahindra.

Resort is in so bad condition that you cannot put your hands on railing of stairs. It‚Äôs literally like ghost town. Location of resort is also very bad because it‚Äôs. very far from main town of Rishikesh. No meaning in staying here. Within an hour we checked out of resort because I am travelling with my 2 small kids and I don‚Äôt want them to catch any fever/ infection due to unhygienic condition of resort.

The rooms themselves are very comfortable: the bathrooms in the new wing are worth mentioning in particular , as they are close to five star.  Shivpuri, where the hotel is located, is not exactly Rishikesh, but about 15 km from Rishikesh town, and is where most of the river rafting starts.

I wouldn't say that everything was perfect but happy faces and hospitality did win over the shortcomings.  The resort is well maintained. Although a few sites claim that it has private beach in reality it is not so; the resort has its own access to the river and beach. Only the guests living in the surrounding resorts visit this area.   The resort has two different sections. The new one has river facing rooms. The old building is the most charming.

tehri-gharwal,"I think everything about the stay was great. We stayed at room # 433, and the view was A.W.E.S.O.M.E.  The Ganga beach was accessible too and was it a beauty! though it needed a li'l trekking (not advisable for old people, or people with bad knees or a bad stamina).... But it you can make it to the beach, I bet you will like to stay there for the rest of the day!!! What clear white sand, and crystal clear water. Loved it! The food at the hotel was very tasty too (we had chinese and North Indian, besides the breakfast buffet). A good shower and a washroom, and a very comfy bed. On top of that, the staff was very attentive and courteous at Reception and restaurant. The only slight drawback was the delayed house-keeping, but I think you can ignore this.",Debaprabho,/Profile/Debaprabho,"Faridabad, India",50

Pros:   1. Beautiful property close to the river banks.  2. Courteous reception staff  Cons: The housekeeping staff's complete disregard for basic hygiene and sanitation.

tehri-gharwal,"PROS: 1) Location: The hotel sit just above the sandy riverbed of the Ganges and lives up to its name. The perpetual cool breeze along with the sound of gushing river water makes it a uniquely refreshing experience. The beach is nice and you relax there for long with feet in cold water. But swimming isn't advisable because of the current. 2)Food: Devoid of variety, the taste is nice and homely. Veg snacks are good. Portion size is decent. A bit expensive (‚Çπ1200/for 2 including mocktails) but worth it. 3)Rafting: Without a doubt the best part about our stay was the rafting experience (we were first timers).

However, the main part is the breathtaking view that the property gives. It is located on the bank of river Ganges (as the name suggests) with white sand beaches, pristine water and mountains all around. One can spend just hours on the river bank and not get bored. There is 'Ganga Aarti' performed every evening and the hotel staff sends you a reminder everyday. Another big plus is that it is also a spot for river rafting, ziplining and kayaking.

Food: I had a fabulous time at this property eating food which is so different from North India veggies, special mention to leaves and beans which have a peculiar taste that made me order everything with seasonal veggies. The chef makes mouth-watering dishes be it non-veg or veg.  Activities: The activities have a special place in my heart now, since i ended up doing Yoga and Rafting.

Their was no towels in the room when we entered, and it took 5 phone calls and 3hrs to finally get the towels. At the restaurant we ordered for a coke, and it seemed the guy turned around and forgot.

Now the cons - 1) The resort doesn't have parking, so your car and driver both need to spend night on the road.  2) The resort is outside town by 15km or so. That's why you can't go for any alternative arrangements for food etc  3) The website says there is spa, but once you reach you get to know it's not true. I am going to Namami resort which is one km away to get massage.   4) Doors are not getting closed properly. There are gaps, so need to bolt it with top latch  5) Fridge in room doesn't cool.

tehri-gharwal,"My stay was so good in this resort and I got the best room which is 301, which had lovely view.  Stay was relaxing and beach was so clear and so as our holy river gangaji...  Road outside the hotel is constructing so expect loads of dust, my car looked so Soo dirty in just 1 night.  Food was good but can be improved a bit... Service is lil slow so it's better u order food well before time.  Staff was very good n helpful.  If you are going by Google maps than location is not correct, hotel is located just next to namami gange resort.  Over very nice stay.",Himanshu J,/Profile/Himanshujohar,"New Delhi, India",40

tehri-gharwal,"Post the NGT ruling prohibiting beach tents, this is probably the last remaining beach hotels with a wonderful river view and access to the river just 2 minutes down the stairs. The hotel has a private beach of sorts. We visited for New Years. Peaceful, must say. Good food. Hospitable and helpful staff. Hotel has its own rafting facility and skilled life guards. Highly recommended!",Rudraneel7,/Profile/Rudraneel7,"Vasai, India",50
tehri-gharwal,very comfortable stay. It has all nice and clean beachfront cottages with western toilets in common. They serve good food and their personal area in front of the beach is very well maintained for a group to play volleyball. All in all its a perfect stay for a weekend to rishikesh.,natasha-porwal,/Profile/natasha-porwal,,50
tehri-gharwal,"Dirty rooms, reluctant staff, cold coffee which is actually hot, no mineral water, no coke or Pepsi, same person will clean your loo and also do room service (nice person though), no menu... You will not even come to know what is being cooked for dinner buffet, snacks for which you have to talk to atleast three different people, linen that has holes and spots, snacks are cooked only if other people also order the same.  Hence not recommended .  Stayed here as it was a last minute travel plan and had no booking. All known good hotels were booked.   Avoid this place.",CountryClubMember,/Profile/CountryClubMember,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",10
tehri-gharwal,"What a lovely location, with Rafting and Zip lines over the Ganges available right next door, this hotel also has a great beach and deck chairs to use. The food served in the hotel and also on the beach was fantastic. The staff in the hotel were excellent, couldn't have done enough for us.   The hotel could do with a little maintenance and tidying up to get a full 5 stars from me, but highly recommended.",Phillip C,/Profile/55phillipc,,40
tehri-gharwal,We visited this resort in March this year... Must say that this is one of the most beautifully located resort in Rishikesh...  The resort is decently maintained and has good rooms with amazing view of The Ganges n Himalayas... The best part about the resort is its private beach...   With a trek of just 5 mins u r on the banks of ganges and the resort management has created sme really nice shacks for u to sit n enjoy.... The resort also arranges for the rafting which also starts from their private beach...  The food served was also nice n simple... The best part is the chef is ready to cook d meals as per ur desires... U ask them to make anything out of the buffet n they dnt mind doing it  n also dnt charge you for it...  The hotel staff is very friendly n always ready to help n,Deeksha25,/Profile/Deeksha25,"Faridabad, India",40

tehri-gharwal,The hotel location and garden is very good. Its a budgeted hotel and very reasonable. I usually stay in the shiv resort whenever i travel to Rishikesh for rafting. The near by restaurants food is also very good. You may see it as complete and reasonable package of tour,Sandeep B,/Profile/708sandeepb,"New Delhi, India",40
