tehri-gharwal,We went there last week and we were a group of 15 people. The only thing we regretted was that we stayed there just for 2 days because the hospitality offered and the location of the camp will force you not to go back to the hectic lifestyle. All of the tents were neat and each of them offered a heavenly view of the hills. The evening snacks and bonfire with such a view was to die for. Moreover the food was fingerlickin’ good and a big thanks to MR.Akash Dua for making our stay a memorable one. Will definitely come again.,Vikhyat,/Profile/Vikhyat098,,50

tehri-gharwal,"I went to this camp in June 2018, I liked it because it is away from all hustle and bustle of city, its in the lap of mother nature. If one is looking for a quiet place then this is the place to be. Camp has few activities in front like zipline(around 50m),burma bridge etc. Food is good. There are places like Surkanda devi(10 minutes drive) for trekking to hill top, besides being a bit religious. Tehri lake (around 45 kms) is come up as a water activity center in the region. One can enjoy jetski, banana boat, bumper boat etc. Overall a good experience.

tehri-gharwal,"""Camp O Royale"" awesome trip . I am visited Camp O Royale last week with my friends.  The location of the camp is also fabulous. The Tents are neat and clean The staff is super polite and helping, The food provided is excellent & delicious, it felt like HOME!!      The atmosphere in the evening is of total party – good DJ, good crowd, and good food – what else you need to have a rocking time. The DJ was good and played songs as per the ‘mood’ of the crowd.  The camp has several activities to keep you engaged throughout the day ... Trekking, Rappelling, Burma Bridge, Commando net, Valley Crossing. We will be come again & again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",mishra_15nilesh,/Profile/mishra_15nilesh,"New Delhi, India",50

The camps are very neat and hygienic, food quality is excellent all camps have mountain view. For adventurous experience everyone should go to dhanaulti. .awesome experience..",neha s,/Profile/nehas2524,,50
tehri-gharwal,First of all there were no proper directions as the camp is out of way and there are no sign boards placed by them. We overshoot the location and had to come back and wasted about 1 hour.  Then after the tents were allocated to us we found dead rats in one of ten inside the quilt. For other tents also the quilts were stinking.  There was no electricity for most of time for our stay. They were having the generator but they refused to start it and gave excuses every time.  Food was below average (tasteless and oily). Team activities were also not much exciting.   The only positive thing was the scenic beauty.,Rajat,/Profile/mcarajatchawla,"Pune, India",10
tehri-gharwal,"We were group 3 couples and last weekend went for camping in Dhanaulti. The location was perfect, the weather was cool, we had a good breakfast after reaching there.  Afternoon we had some activities like Barma bridge, Mowgli walk etc.. the trainer was good. The Rapelling, Mount Climbing and Flying Fox was cancelled because of rain.  Now on rain, they had no arrangements.That are is bound to have rainfall however no proper arrangements are made for it. We have to keep ourselves inside our tent. There was lack of service from evening. The tents were filled with more than its capacity. The evening snacks gets finished in no time and many were hungry even though it was served at 8:30. The flush in the bathroom was not working but no effect after informing them.  We have to help",MohitRicha,/Profile/MohitRicha,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",20
tehri-gharwal,"i visited the camp on family trip, it was a great experience. Its location is beautiful, the tents are comfortable. the staff is very friendly, the food is great, my daughter enjoyed a lot, she had a lot of fun doing adventure activities and enjoyed evening bonfire. a nice place to unwind on weekends. however, they can add some attractions like some indoor games or some more adventure activities. hopefully would visit the place once again, with a bigger group.",ravish2014,/Profile/ravish2014,"Faridabad, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"We have been to this place in a group of 5 and had a great experience of camping in the lap of the Himalayas. Though we did not have much info / review on this place before arriving there, but after visiting this camp, I must say it is a great place to spend your short weekends near Delhi. We were very happy with the overall experience. A special appreciation for the Camp o Royale staffs for their services and the cook for feeding us finger licking food even at such a remote place.  The only challenge is that you have to have your own vehicle to reach at this place as it is located at a bit disconnected place from the main road, but this actually adds to the camping experience.",OmkarS83,/Profile/OmkarS83,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"I visited dhanaulti with my colleagues from work last weekend. After driving for good 10 hrs we reached camp o royale to a fabulous welcome early in the morning. Checked in the camps, which were fabulous, comfortable and cozy. Day was spent relaxing and going for a jungle treck. Evening there are host of physical activities on the camp which are worth a try. Late evening started with the bonfire with temperature dippin quite a bit. Snacks were served though we had to pay extra for non veg snacks but it was worth it. Evening was spent chit chatting, drinking all this along with the warmth of the bonfire and the service staff. Dinner was served in the dining hall which was excellent. The chicken curry and rice specially along with other things just was the icing on the cake after",Ankit,/Profile/Ankitn,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"An opportunity to get far away from this maddening heat and a break from the daily grind took us to this amazingly beautiful and tranquil hill hamlet of Dhanaulti.  A relatively untouched place makes it an ideal destination just to soak in its resplendent beauty adorned by alpine forests of Deodar and oak trees. The cool breeze carrying clean air is a treat for the lungs, quiet surroundings with the exception of sweet sounds of the birds give such a joy to the heart unexpressed in words.  Time seems to stop when you lay down on the green grass and gaze at the unending mountains covered with trees...it takes you..it certainly took me!  Camp O Royale gets my vote for being a no fuss camping site...Just get out of your Swiss tent and you get to witness the nature's splendor in full",barun c,/Profile/64barunc,,40
tehri-gharwal,I wanted a long break from my working and busy schedule so thought of going about camp o Royale as I was suggested... I was accompanied by my family and my close family... We were in all about 10 people! Believe me or not..the place is like a true heaven... the location and view from the site just kills all the tension and stress... A person would just want to sit and watch the view throughout...! The food was amazing! accomadation and services were really great. People working there are really helpful and friendly... I would suggest that a person must go and visit the same! Its worth all your money and time! Camp o Royale it is! Cudos! I'll surely plan another vacation there.. Wonderful experience,synthster,/Profile/synthster,,40
tehri-gharwal,"Our group of 15 people have been to this camp in Dhanaulti last week. The experience was not good.The approach towards these camps is not on concrete road but highly slippery sand. Even the camps have not been surrounded by concrete pathways but just left raw with sand and dust all around. The kitchen is not hygienic and they prepare all snacks / breakfast /lunch full of potatoes only. Not a safe place to keep your belongings, please take care of your mobiles / chargers and even memory cards are not spared as the charging points are available at the cafeteria only. Better to book a hotel with lock and key instead of going for these camps.",AnonymousChandigarh,/Profile/AnonymousChandigarh,Chandigarh,10
tehri-gharwal,"I am just back from a 4 day trip to this place in Dhanaulti. Camp O Royale is an adventure camp which offers Swiss and Luxury tents. The tents have full bedding and tiled washrooms. The food is much better than what I expected in a camp. The three course meal is included in the package. There is a bon-fire every night and a small DJ set up. On the nights we were there, there was a group of friends who were playing a guitar and singing. The camp boasts of some very good adventure activities - Flying Fox, Burma Bridge etc. But the best of all is rock climbing and rappelling. Though you have to walk 1-2 km for getting to the place where rock climbing is done, but it is worth it. All-in-all it was a fantastic experience and is highly recommended.",Saurabh M,/Profile/saurabhm85,"London, Canada",50
