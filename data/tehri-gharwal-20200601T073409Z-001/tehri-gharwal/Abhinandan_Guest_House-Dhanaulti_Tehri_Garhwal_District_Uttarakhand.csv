tehri-gharwal,"We were 4 people stayed at this hotel. We booked a 2 Double bed room which cost us Rs.1200/night. We did lunch and dinner with a good number of teas for which paid Rs.2200 around at checkout.   We had a good experience with all the facilities like hot water, fast service and more. They don't have wifi but free parking is available.  The best part was FOOD. We ordered Parathas, Tawa Chapatis, Vegetables such as Kadhai Paneer, Mix veg, Dal Makhni, Sandwiches- for breakfast and Tea. You will be amazed with taste and of-course quality- fresh and genuine quality food. Kadhai Paneer was our best tasted food here following with parathas and tea quality.  This hotel is located opposite to Gramin Bank, walking distance from Eco-park and around 4 km away from Maa Surkanda Devi temple.",VishalKhari,/Profile/VishalKhari,"New Delhi, India",40
