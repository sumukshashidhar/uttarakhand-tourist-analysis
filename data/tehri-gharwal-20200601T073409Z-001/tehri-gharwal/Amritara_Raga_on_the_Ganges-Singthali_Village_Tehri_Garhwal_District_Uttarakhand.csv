tehri-gharwal,"What was great: 1.) Location for invaluable Ganga view What was good: 1.) Quality & up keep of rooms  2.) Quality of the massage  What was average: 1.) Food  What needs to be thought on : 1.) How people can spend time while visiting here.  2.) Distance from main Rishikesh is significant and the cost of traveling up and down is 2.5 to 3.5 k. Hence if your agenda is ticking the bucket list in main Rishikesh, then this is not the place for you. 3.) Landslides on the route is a common phenomenon which can disrupt your schedule for 1-2 hours. Hence this time needs to be budgeted in the schedule  However given the price, it is a good option for a 2 nights relaxation",Aman-Tekriwal,/Profile/Aman-Tekriwal,"Mumbai, India",40

Our fatigue simply vanished in thin air with warm hospitable staff at the reception, who upgraded us to a cottage with the best views. The Raga in itself is the best property that one can think of staying for a short vacation, or an elongated stay. Situated next to the Ganges, it offers ethereal views of the white sand river bed. The property is well maintained and the owner takes active interest in making his guests comfortable. The restaurant and spa are must visits. Food is amazing. Overall, it calls for a repeat.

Hospitality is a basic expectation when anyone is on a leisure trip. In this resort, apart from few servers, nobody knows anything about hospitality and being courteous starting from the GM till the room service guys.  There are multiple instances to support: 1.

We stayed for 3 nights in a standard room which was average area size and had big common outside sitting area shared by 3 rooms. (cottages are bigger with their own private outside sitting place).

tehri-gharwal,"Very good resort situated 35 km from Rishikesh (towards Devprayag). You can see the Ganges flowing from almost all places in the resort and can actually hear the Ganges flow at night.  Good staff, good food, lot if greenery are all very positive and definitely help you relax. You could climb down the stairs to the Ganges which we did and we enjoyed immensely. Although, beware, the stairs are not the best maintained and you will come across monkeys when you climb down.  All in all, we had amazing fun. What could be better is that they only have parking space for 8 cars. The resort is remotely situated as would be expected of a resort but then that makes having more parking slots an essential. Not a deal breaker though and overall, the resort is definitely recommended. ",Bhuwan S,/Profile/bhuwans279,"Ghaziabad, India",50

This was a most pleasant surprise and to add to it, the rooms were spacious, immaculately maintained with all modern amenities and tastefully decorated too (loved the drapes covering the Full Glass windows overlooking the Ganges! Yes...all the cottages had a great view of the Ganga and the surrounding Shivalik Hills. We could also spot several tents, a suspension bridge across the river and a pure white sand shore on the opposite bank :) Oh yes...we did go there ;-)  The hotel staff were good and very soft,",KLNATARAJ,/Profile/KLNATARAJ,"Chennai, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"If you appreciate lush and green surroundings you have come to the right place, to the tropical foothills of the lower Himalayas, not far from Rishikesh, where you can enjoy spectacular views from the private deck, living room, bedrooms and yes from the bathroom too. Absolutely breathtaking location, serene atmosphere and the Ganga flowing under your feet. The lush and cool location of the valley is generally cooler than the town, providing a pleasant place to relax after a long drive. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable, with all modern amenities and the staff were helpful and welcoming. There is no shops and markets around, so come prepared and well packed or do some last minute shopping in Rishikesh. Restaurant serves great freshly cooked food, try their local",DSaurav,/Profile/DSaurav,"New Delhi, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"We visited this hotel in May, 2014. The place is away from mainstream Rishikesh and gave a much needed retreat from the busy city life. The holy Ganges was our first place of visit, only steps away from the hotel.The rooms are huge and airy with a wonderful view. It was soothing for the eyes to see the variety of flora in the property. Food and service were beyond expectations. A swimming pool in the hotel was a nice surprise! It is a must visit property..

Absolutely breathtaking location, serene atmosphere and the Ganga flowing under your feet. Aesthetically designed rooms with modern facilities, delicious food and above all, great service. your every need is met with perfection and courtesy. despite being on the hills with trouble going up and down again and again for staff, you don't see even an iota of strain. The icing on the cake was the ""Ganga  Jal"" straight from the river downstairs for us to carry. Mr. Awasthi, Mr. Dabral and The chef were outstanding and I congratulate the management to have such a fantastic team.... A must visit",Manoj_0611,/Profile/Manoj_0611,"New Delhi, India",50

The plus points...   - its an absolutely breathtaking location!! - flowers and trees and landscaped well - cut out on the mountain side , the river ganga flows beneath it - the rooms are lovely airy with great forest/river/mountain views - Some rooms/cottages have a sit out which has well thought of swings hammocks garden chairs laid out - the sit-outs at every nook and corner of the resort are absolutely delightful, with a hammock in one / terrace garden in the other/ slider chair overlooks the flowing ganges on another lovely gardens for the kids to play. - the food is good, the kitchen caters to kids (even infants) with as much joy as they do to adults! yes you can order khidchri for your little ones. --The pool location is stunning  if you are a",Prachi G,/Profile/prachig2014,,30
tehri-gharwal,"To start with you will feel it's a bit far from rishikesh but I assure the  moment you step into the resort you will feel elated. The rooms are huge and beautifully designed. The food was great. The General Manager Mr. Avasti was very helpful and remembered me by by name, something which is very uncommon these days. The only drawback is that the resort doesn't have its own vehicle for guests in case they require for short trips. Had a wonderful time.  Will stay here only whenever I visit Rishikesh ",Umeshghai,/Profile/Umeshghai,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"We stayed in this hotel on 22nd March, this was our first stay in this resort and I must admit it's a resort where you want to come again n again. This is a must visit resort, you should book without considering any other hotel. There are only two best hotels over there 1. Raga 2. Atali.  The benefit of this hotel is, it's on the right hand side or road i.e. Ganga is directly accessible from hotel on the other hand Atali is on the left hand side and the best of Raga is, best beach of rishikesh is quite near from this hotel.  Here are some of the things I would like to mention:  1.  Rooms are very nice with big single glass window.  2.  It has very big terraces, you don't want to go inside, just enjoy the peaceful enviorment with view of The Ganges & beautiful mountains. 3.

tehri-gharwal,"Raga has brought a new angle to Rishikesh which earlier only had Ananda in the luxury space. The location is spectacular along the banks of the sea green Ganga, with a white sand beach and the majestic Himalayas as the backdrop. I could stare at the view forever!! This is perfect for families and groups who want to come and chill in Rishikesh with a sophisticated touch. Our room was an individual cottage built in the log hut style and a huge picture window facing the river. One of the best things about the place is that they have two beautiful terraces where you can sit out and admire the views. Great place to have a few drinks at night as well; the view of the unbelievably starry sky and the chill in the air is all anyone can ask for.

We had the luxury to pick our room and the log hut assigned to us had an amazing view of the Ganges and the Mountains, was spacious and nicely done up. Food was simply amazing and so was the hospitality of the staff.

The staff were so helpful it was just unbelievable. I have travelled around the world and have Platinum and Gold memberships with many top brand hotels so I am used to that extra attention but this was something else. The attention was genuine and honest.  The food was yum and they pretty much prepared what we asked.  We are all in so much love with the place.

We had booked our stay for 25th Dec- 27th Dec 2013 thinking that it will be an exciting experience for us and our 4 year old as its the most happening time of the year !!  Surprises:  1st - When we checked in on 25th Dec was the entire resort was almost empty only 3 occupancy, hence the place lacked any energy with no excitement. 2nd - No buffet spread - only room service!  3rd - No activities , when asked if there was any fun elements for kids and adults we were told none and provided us some board games in room.   We were confined in the room and watch TV and play those board games. If I had to stay in the room, I would not have travelled thousands of km to Rishikesh.

tehri-gharwal,"If you are travelling with senior citizens or toddlers(as was my case), then raga is not the place for you.   The resort is built at different levels and to get to any place like the dining room or the spa you need to take multiple flights of steps.  We stayed in a standard room which was big and neat.The bathrooms were clean as well. I just felt that the rooms could have been done up better. The log huts and cottages looked very nice but didn't quite get a chance to check out their interiors.       The view from the resort of the mountains and the ganges flowing through was beautiful. The staff was polite and efficient. Food was excellent.  But my biggest complaint was bad access to the ganges.

tehri-gharwal,"We are senior citizens from Canada of Indian origin and was travelling from Badrinath to Kedarnath on the fateful day of June 16, 2013. We reached Phata, the helicoptor pad on June 15, 2013 from where helicopter will fly us to Kedarnath on June 16, 2013.  It was pouring rain all night and the river Mandakini was ferocious with about 10 foot waves.  We were terribly frightened and were reluctant to go ahead the rest of 20 KM to Gowrikund to take the pony or chair car to Kedar.  The road ahead of us collapsed, the helicopters were cancelled and we were told not to leave Phata, lest we will be washed into the river if we drive on the road full of landslides and mud.  Our driver told us that we will be killed if we stayed.  So, we left Phata in pouring rain and drove all day over",torontokrishnan,/Profile/torontokrishnan,"Toronto, Canada",50

Situated along the river ganges around Kaudiyala, this is a place perfect for a soothing and relaxing vacation.  As soon as they showed us their river view cottage we immediately decided to stay there. Superb location I must say. Beautifully maintained.
