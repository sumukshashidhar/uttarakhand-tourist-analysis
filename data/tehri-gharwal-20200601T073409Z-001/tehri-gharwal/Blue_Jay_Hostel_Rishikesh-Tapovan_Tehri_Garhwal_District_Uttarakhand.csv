But one of the highlights of my experience was to participate at a small gathering just before Christmas. Together with the staff and some amazing travelers we prepared some gifts for the children from a village near by. It filled my heart with joy to see how we can all contribute for the happiness of this community. I had a lot of fun during all the activities that they provided for us, especially Family Dinner and Life Music Night. I came as a guest and I left as member of a big family.

tehri-gharwal,"Blue Jay was not only the best hostel I stayed at while in India, it's the best hostel I've ever stayed in throughout all of Asia. I was overjoyed with the happiness and helpfulness of their staff, especially since I was staying there during the corona virus outbreak. They were extremely responsible. They encouraged guests to remain indoors or at least not venture too far. They planned small events for the guests who were stuck due to the outbreak. And they did not allow new bookings for the time being to ensure the safety of their existing guests. I was very happy to be at Blue Jay during a time like that. They were on top of the situation, which is more than most places in Rishikesh could say.  Corona virus aside, Blue Jay was very good value for money.

There was also free wifi. And all these came at a cheap price. I am sure it would have costed us a fortune if you wanted to avail those facilities in a resort or so.

tehri-gharwal,"This place is Honestly Theee Nicest Most Cleanest Hostel I‚Äôve stayed in. It‚Äôs a perfect mix between hotel and hostel.   Stayed in the female dorm.  So clean, so comfy. So safe.  Lovely luxurious bathroom!   I Felt like a backpacking queen.   The common rooms are just amazing. So cozy & clean & homely.   They offer a wide range of activities, and perfectly organised.  The staff are So Helpful & So Kind.   Such a safe place with the perfect amount of space for your stuff in personal drawers.   Couldn‚Äôt recommend it more!   This is what hostels should be :D   Loved Rishikesh and this hostel just made everything 10x better.  Thankyou!    I look forward to coming back x ",@daisymae,/Profile/daisymae1994,,50
tehri-gharwal,"Blue jay hostel was like a home for us. We booked 3 days and stayed there for a month. The room was very clean and very comfortable. We also enjoyed the food in the roof restaurant, with the great attitude and care of Rahul the cheff. Most of all we were always welcomed by all the people who work in the hostel, who were helpful and attentive. Especially Rabindra became our friend and took care of us even after we left the hostel, and even after we left Rishikesh!!!  We did many things in Rishikesh, and Rabindra is certainly one of the best things that happened to us.",Avital L,/Profile/TrailBlazer369504,,50
tehri-gharwal,Goodness - can‚Äôt do justice with just this review. We stayed here 2 weeks. Cleanest hostel we have been to in India. Bathrooms in every dorm and extras in the hallways. Beds and sheets are clean and comfortable. Common area is large and very bright and open. Very social atmosphere for solo or more travelers. Delicious family dinner once a week. Ravinder helped us so much during our stay. The rest of the staff were absolutely amazing as well. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a positive experience in Rishikesh. ,Ayman,/Profile/nimblefox,"Vancouver, Canada",50
tehri-gharwal,"Great place to stay ! It is centrally located to the major hotspots in rishikesh. The washrooms are super clean and hygiene in dorm and washrooms are always maintained.   The washroom fittings are of premium quality and the stay experience is a great luxury.  The common area is a great place  with beautiful ambience to sit and enjoy and socialize. It has some games like zenga , carrom , fooseball, ludo , chess , swing , TV where you can fun with friends and family.  At the top is a terrace garden which covers a beautiful view of Rishikesh and the roof top dinning is again a great experience.  The staff is courteous and friendly.",Prerna,/Profile/prerna1024,,50
tehri-gharwal,"We loved our stay at Blue Jay!üíô It was clean, cozy and the team was super cool, friendly and always helping out, if we had questions or troubles finding something. This guys are multi talents and the chef cook is an ARTIST!  We were lucky that it was raining so much, so we tried the ""Nest Cafe"" at the rooftop and üôä OMG it was soooooo good, that we had to force ourselves to leave the hotel and eat sometimes somewhere else!üòÖ  I definitely recommend it!üëçüèΩ",Emina,/Profile/Yoga_emina,,50
tehri-gharwal,"This hostel is a big bang for the buck! It's so clean and beautiful. I am amazed by how it has managed to balance exceptionally professional service with a homely warmth. I am someone who doesn't usually prefer hostels but, this place managed to change my opinion. Dorm beds are very comfortable and give a sense of privacy; after an exhausting day, you'll be glad you chose to stay here. Blue Jay has taken care of details with lockers/closet that has inbuilt lights and allows you to access your stuff without making your dorm-mates uncomfortable :) It has a common area that gives a perfect ambience to chill, relax and interact with others. It has focused on creating an environment that is inclusive, fun and safe. The staff is very knowledgeable and you can rely on them for local",Akanksha,/Profile/AkTravelsforFun,,50
tehri-gharwal,"For the price and location you can‚Äôt complain! I think it was ¬£4 a night.   The hostel is very clean, and fresh with comfy bed. Each bed has a secure draw which you can lock.   They have a big common are with big sofas, which is a nice place to hang out during spare time.   The hostel has a drop in yoga instructor too which looked great and I think was based on donations rather than a price.   Definatly should consider staying here if you are visiting rishikesh.",cardiffcityrh,/Profile/cardiffcityrh,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",50
tehri-gharwal,"We spent two weeks in this hostel. We are in our 60‚Äôs and we‚Äôre looking for a clean place to sleep and not too expensive. Blue Jay Hostel is the perfect place for that.

tehri-gharwal,"1. Clean and hygenic place to stay. 2. Washrooms were properly cleaned. 3. Services are good. 4. Food was of good quality. 5. They have common area to sit, watch TV, play games or to read books. 6. They provide us a scooty for local travelling and cab to Dehradun airport at good rates. Overall value for money. We stayed there for 2 nights from 25th October to 27 october in room number 8 on third floor.Hotel Tip: Take any room...but delux room has everything",Neha G,/Profile/nehag564,"Mumbai, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"This place may become good eventually, but atm it is soulless in every way. It needs 'dressing' ... paintings, fabrics ... something to take away the hospital look. If you want a feeling of India, this isn‚Äôt the place. It‚Äôs a sterile environment into which the staff inject no warmth or seeming care about their guests. In a week's stay we were never asked are things ok, do you want anything, new towels, clean the room, anything? Even hello or good morning appeared too tricky. Things are starting to deteriorate in the newish building ... doors not closing correctly, shower not draining. No smoking on the premises (threat of 1000 rupee fine) so people smoke at the entrance. Nothing said, presumably. We checked out early, and were happy to leave.",mth180,/Profile/mth180,"Athens, Greece",20
tehri-gharwal,"Although the hostel is very clean and modern, the service is terrible.  The service: 1. Me and my boyfriend were leaving Rishikesh early in the morning. Since there are not many taxis around, we asked receptionist to book one. Hostel charged us 600 Rs for a 4.5 km ride (almost the same as amount we paid for Rishikesh - Delhi bus ride). Even though we knew we are being ripped off, we went to sleep calmly because we had a secure taxi at 6:30 AM. However, taxi was half an hour late in the morning, which was not fun since we were catching a flight in Delhi. The receptionist was very rude, acting like this is a normal situation. He refused to give us his name or manager contact and started to sing while we were obviously upset. Since I do not have his name or anyone to complain about",Ivana I,/Profile/607ivanai,,10
tehri-gharwal,"Highly recommend this place. Our stay at Blue Jay was simply perfect. We stayed for more than a week. The hostel is pretty new and they are still working on artwork and stuff but it‚Äôs already so amazing. The Staff, Dipan, Rahul, Shiva and everyone else are so friendly and will literally do anything to make you feel comfortable and at home. They will help you with onward travel bookings and recommend you the best places around and also help you with scooter renting and so on. The hostel has a big kitchen on the rooftop where they serve food but we could also use it by ourself. The whole property is super clean and probably the best part is that they have loooooots of open space (outside and inside) to do Yoga or just relax. The common area is HUGE, perfect place to hang out and",Marlene,/Profile/MarleneS2657,"Graz, Austria",50
