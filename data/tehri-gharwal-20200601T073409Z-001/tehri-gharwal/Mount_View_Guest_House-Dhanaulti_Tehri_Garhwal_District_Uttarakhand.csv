tehri-gharwal,"Located amidst the Shivalik hills, staying in this hotel felt like being in the lap of nature.  The hotel room was very well maintained, neat and clean. We went for a room with 3 beds.  The room had a television and cup board. Quilt was provided in the room.  Stay was comfortable.  The hotel had a restaurant attached to it with served delicious food but very few options available in the menu.",Rajani K,/Profile/RajaniK70,,30
tehri-gharwal,"What I loved most about this Hotel was it's location and the picturesque views which it provided.  The views of the distant Himalayas, the terraced farming along the hill slopes, the valleys etc. were simply amazing.  The hotel rooms were pleasant having facilities of a cable television and attached bathroom with hot and cold water.  Room service was quick and good. There is a restaurant attached to the hotel. We had delicious parathas for our breakfast at the restaurant in the morning.",rambha b,/Profile/rambhab1,,30
tehri-gharwal,"The Hotel is located on the main road which connects Dhanaulti to Uttar Kashi. This hotel was our first halt on our trip from New Delhi to Gangotri. The location of the hotel is fantastic.  The rooms offer a great view of the mountains.  The picturesque view of the hilly terrain, the terraced farming on the mountains and the peaks of the Himalayas is very appeasing.    The Hotel Room was comfortable.  Each room had a cable television , an attached bathroom with the facility of hot and cold water and a ward robe. The rooms were well maintained, neat and clean. The service was not up to the mark ... follow ups were required. We felt the pricing was on the higher side but we visited on a national holiday. That could be the reason for high price.",Rajesh k,/Profile/rajeshk712,"New Delhi, India",30
