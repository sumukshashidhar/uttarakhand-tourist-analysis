tehri-gharwal,"We travelled from Delhi to Rishikesh in a group of 9 female and one infant and had our booking in the River Lap for 5-6 October. We did the booking through OYO by making full advance payment. On reaching the cottage we were told that they discontinued with OYO a week back and could not accommodate us. After hassling with OYO for two hours we finally decided to spend the night in River lap anyhow. Why did they provide us toiletries of OYO when they don't take OYO booking now? The cottages are nothing that they showed us in the pictures online. Pathetic service with no hot water in the bathroom, broken doors, holed walls in bathroom, unclean room, dirty bed sheets. Overall the property is poorly maintained and is not at all worth staying. There was no food service either as their",Chandni T,/Profile/483chandnit,"New Delhi, India",10

tehri-gharwal,"I was introduced to this property by a friend who had stayed here earlier. I was a little skeptical to start with, for I didn't know what to expect - it was also my first trip to Rishikesh. But all my worries and inhibitions were washed away like the footprints in the rain, by the hospitable and affable staff. The cottages aren't far from the river bank, and you could actually run down the hill relax by the bank in few minutes. The manager was quite helpful and took a special care of us. He arranged a bonfire, music and rafting for us. The cottages were clean and the beds quite comfortable. The food was delectable and the service top-notch. I will recommend this property to anyone planning a trip to Rishikesh and will surely return soon. Thank you for making this short visit",Rahul R,/Profile/RahulR2844,,50

I am a Non-Veg lover, I ordered mutton to be prepared in a village style, i got the food which was far behind my imaginations. Perfect destination to relax, chill & have couple of beers or scotch in the moonlight. You get few sports equipment also to spend your evening time. I booked the cottage with package including river-rafting, which removed my headache of negotiating with agents doing booking for rafting.

tehri-gharwal,"Just came yesterday from Shivpuri. Although it wasn't my first trip to shivpuri and rishikesh, but it was something new to me because of a new resort ""The River Lap"". Situated within the lush greenry of shivpuri near ganges river, the resort offered me a wonderful experience. The unique thing was the construction of the traditional type cottages on the greenry of Shivpuri which offers a picturesque view of majestically stand hills. Be it food, sports, rooms and other facilities, the river lap offers great services.  ",Bhandari31,/Profile/Bhandari31,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"This has to be one of the unique properties near Rishikesh, The staffs are the real gem of this place. They overly attentive, compliant and cooperative. The care taker (Vinod)  makes sure to greet each visitor warmly and shows them to the room.  The food is simple and wholesome with real quality ingredients. Kudos to the owner. While our stay we never felt that we are away from our house.   Purposefully (and thankfully) there is no TV anywhere in the property. Spending time here away from noise and distraction makes one appreciate the nature more closely with your love ones. We had really calm and serene stay to rejuvenate our mind and body and would like to return in future.",MilanRajput,/Profile/MilanRajput,India,50
