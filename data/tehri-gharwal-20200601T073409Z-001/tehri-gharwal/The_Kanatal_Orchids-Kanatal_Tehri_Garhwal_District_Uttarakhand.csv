tehri-gharwal,Me and my friends visited this place .we we re late due to office work and reached around 9:30pm .owner was so rude and said everything will be closed at 10:30.we argued and wanted to leave and ask for refund. But the owner started misbehaving and abusing and after lots of talks and spoiled our night.the owner Mr. Dhyani is the worst person I ever came across.He is brainless and was playing cards while attending the guests...plz don't spoil ur vacation by going there.it was a bad night.,Puttu,/Profile/Puttupawan,,10
tehri-gharwal,"Good and hard working Staff with Poor remote management, Need to include few amenities. Need to have Courteous Booking Manager and Following things to improve. 1) Cleaning and basic amenities in Washrooms. 2) Need to provide better outdoor sitting and recreation activities in the camp. 3) Tents are over crowded with Beds makes no space even to keep belongings. 4) Overpriced with the quality of place, Need to make this place value for money.

tehri-gharwal,"Sad experience, not an ideal camp for couples.We had booking for 2 nights but we decided to checkout overnight, we had no choice as we arrived at around 7.30pm and checked out 11am next morning. Before making my booking at the camp I had a detailed chat with the Owner Mr.Nikhil and I was particular about the occupancy at the camp(my personal preference) and was advised not to come for Thursday-Friday as occupancy would be less but come on weekend that is Friday-Sat which will be 60% occupancy so I planned accordingly but on reaching there were only 5 more people other than us and the entire camp looked haunted.Coming to the camps they are not Swiss from any angle, shady with hanging wires,bed of poorest quality as if you are sleeping on a wooden board with no mattress in",Khushboo,/Profile/NKhushboo,,10
tehri-gharwal,"Be it for a break from the busy corporate life or just contemplation, this place is perfect for all.   We were a group of 15 people and visited Kanatal Orchids during early monsoon this year. We thoroughly enjoyed the place and the service. While the mornings were peaceful, the days were packed with activities and the evenings with good food, music and bonfire.   We were lucky enough to be there at the time that the apple trees were fruiting and so, we could taste apples right off the trees ( justifying the name of the place :-) ).  The staff was responsive and the hosts, hospitable.  Overall, it was a great experience and the place is highly recommended!",Sam,/Profile/sambahuguna,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
tehri-gharwal,"Perfect location with extraordinary hospitality. Staff was really courteous especially Mr Manoj. Food was not that great, but you cant expect too much given the offbeat location. Would highly recommend if you are travelling with a friends group / couple.",Rishabh Gupta,/Profile/RishabhG271,,50
tehri-gharwal,This place is actually like a dream destination for holidays. It is located at a very good place with mountains all around. The relaxed and elegant atmosphere adds to the feeling of serenity inside the camps.   The owner was very courteous and helpful and I was extremely pleased with the level of service they gave us.,Nandita54,/Profile/Nandita454,,50
tehri-gharwal,"We had the opportunity to spend 2 nights at Kanatal Orchids Camp and they were the best moment of our entire Uttarakhand Roadtrip. We were welcomed with the local drink Buransh by the staff and then were allocated swiss tents overlooking the Himalayan ranges. Waking up to those views nmand watching the glorious sunset everyday is all we wanted. We were served wholesome hearty breakfast, lunch and dinner and it definitely didn't make us miss home. We also experienced Ziplining, Skywalking and Valley crossing adventures through Kanatal Orchids. The staff was quite humble and caring and the manager Manojji made sure that he took care of us well. We will denitely return to this paradise soon. ",Donald & Diana,/Profile/naughtyandcurly,"Mumbai, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"We stayed 2 nights and had such a memorable time. Amazing location and food was nice too. Good location, friendly staff, good food and nice music with bonfire. Only suggestion to add more activity and serve hot food. Rest all good for the price we paid.",Sujib C,/Profile/SujibC1,"Noida, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"Perfect destination if you love to have time with yourself. Away from the hustle of city, rejuvenate and refill yourself with life, peace, abundance of nature and lots of freshness. The Kanatal Orchids offers perfect hospitality - delicious food, comfortable stay and awesome service - it all leaves you with memorable experience and everlasting memories. Enjoy - hot tea and pakodas by the Bonfire, yummy food by Yogesh 'Yogi', never-say-no-hospitality by Ranaji and hot water in the chill of weather...what else you need. Breathe life, head for The Kanatal Orchids",Anurag Juyal,/Profile/AnuragJuyal,,50
tehri-gharwal,"We visited The Kanatal Orchids in the month of December.   It takes too much time to reach the place (Approx 10+ hours from New Delhi via Bus).  Once you reach the place you have to deboard the Bus and walk inside the Camp for around 200-300 meters to reach the room. The way to camp is very risky as there were no lights or very dim lights so if you don't use the flashlights from your phone you may fall.   Bonfire was great as it was a relief in such a cold place. We also enjoyed snacks and tea.   Regarding camp rooms they were not very cozy as it was extremely cold, washroom were just okay.   The outlet of the washbasin was within the washroom itself and since the water from the washbasin (that is located at the middle of the washroom) has to travel either through the toilet",Ramandeep,/Profile/raman_4768,"New Delhi, India",30

tehri-gharwal,"Nestled in  nature and providing stunning views of the snow capped Himalaya's, the kanatal orchids can be described perfectly in three words serene splendid and peaceful. People who are tired of there 10-6 schedule, this is you best weekend gateway where you can enjoy nature's calmness and also engage in various sports and leisure activities. The camp owner along with the staff was very hospitable and cooperative. The food was very good and the camps and the entire property was well maintained. Overall a perfect place to unwind yourself. A 10 on 10 experience. Highly recommended.",sameeksha d,/Profile/sameekshad2018,"Dehradun, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"Kanatal was the last leg of my journey into mountains of northern uttarakhand. I was to stay here to tend to my wounds that were incurred during treacherous and slippery rides in defrosting mountains of Bhairon ghati range.  I was primarily apprehensive about my decision of staying in a campsite; out in mountains, in the fag end of winters. Then they stepped in to prove me wrong..  1. Location 10/10. They do have beautiful view of complete himalayan range and even though they're not adjacent to main road, they are pretty much accessible.  2. The tents 10/10. They were naturally heated to hospitable temperature by rays of sun. Let me vouch that they were warmer than the room I stayed in earlier.  3. Facility 09/10. Firm beds, insulating mattresses, more than required upholstery, ",Tarun G,/Profile/TarunG414,,50

tehri-gharwal,"Always heard of this place but never thought it would turn as my first step towards realising wat makes me happiest. Living in Delhi for a long time has made me hate commercialised places, like every other hill station has become. So while planning a trip for my team, one thing I was sure of was, to take them to the place which bursts the daily office stress, makes them feel happy and together my team should also be able to witness the true beauty of hills and the culture. Luckily, we got all at one place, The Kanatal Orchids. The jungle walk made us witness the beautiful sunset, while the rappelling and rock climbing helped us in testing the stamina left within. Eating out every day really makes me hate spiced up food, so simple plain food prepared in Pahari style was a treat",travelolz,/Profile/travelolz,"New Delhi, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"I visited Kanatal Orchids in July and since it was raining heavily, we could not enjoy trekking and hence had to stay inside the camps only. Electricity was a major concern and fooding is the major part which needs to be taken care. The view from the camp area is beautiful and if the weather remains nice, it is a perfect place to forget the daily hassles and enjoy peace",nisha s,/Profile/nishas912,,30
tehri-gharwal,"Few places remain around NCR that are not buzzing with tourists during summer months. As I was looking for a quiet vacation to escape the heat I came across a friend's post on facebook about Kanatal Orchids. Impressed with her reviews, albeit skeptical, I booked for 2 nights with my family.  We were given a warm welcome by the staff and manager who had come to receive us at the base of the camp.The Swiss tents we were given were spacious, and comfy with a breathtaking view of the mountains. The staff is courteous and friendly. We really liked the fresh and organic food that was served hot. Evening bonfire was the best part for me. Had a great time, cannot wait to go back.",Anki90,/Profile/Anki90,"Bengaluru, India",50

tehri-gharwal,"Being a Dehradun local boy I never realised that instead of requesting parents and relative in childhood to have a trip of Mussorie, ( which become more commercial place like a Delhi now ), I would have requested them for visiting to Kanatal, Recently had a visit this place in Mar'16 and when the other north Indian places were getting ready for scary summers, this place was pretty cold and will make you to fall in love with the nature. The most surprising thing was the hospitality provided by The Kanatal Orchids and team at this place was just amazing and         un-expected. Food was delicious and it's worth it.",BobSharma1990,/Profile/BobSharma1990,Bangalore,50
tehri-gharwal,"I have written many reviews pointing to the positives and areas for betterment. For Kanatal Orchids I am afraid, I am struggling to think of any positives.   We were a group of 26 people, family and friends on a trip to Kanatal. The approach to the camps from the road is about 200 metres away but that is what was expected. On reaching the site, we found that no effort have been put into landscaping. Tents have been setup just next to each other, making it quite congested. Although promised to be put into Swiss tents, we were given some Swiss tents and some Alpine tents. Though the Swiss tents were to some extent acceptable, the Alpine tents were horrible. All the tents were stinking, washrooms not clean - and moreover, the outlet of the washbasin was withing the washroom itself.",ProsadRoy,/Profile/ProsadRoy,"Noida, India",10
