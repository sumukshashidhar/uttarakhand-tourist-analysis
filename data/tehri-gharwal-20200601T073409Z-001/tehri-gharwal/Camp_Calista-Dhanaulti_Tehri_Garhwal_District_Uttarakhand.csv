tehri-gharwal,"This place is not for couples or small family due to its location away from market or city. We chose it for team outing and it turned out to an amazing trip due to the comfortable stay, tasty food, friendly staff and Mr sunil(owner) because of is cooperation. They provide hot water during morning hours, buffet meals and cocktail snacks with a little extra cost.  A must visit place for team outings.",Amarpreet_Saggu,/Profile/Amarpreet_Saggu,"Noida, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"1. “Camp Calista” was renamed as “Camp Dhanaulti Magic” when it changed hands from one owner to the next. They are one and the same. I however see different reviews under the two names.  2. All Camp owners have joined hands to raise their prices similar to the hotels and resorts, which have spent lot of money in doing the construction and landscaping. These camps are nice, but do not deserve to be at even half the price. They charged us Rs.2K for each person. So 8K per night for 4 of us. “Green forest Resorts” located within the same premises, provide much much better facilities. 3. The beds and the sheets looks shabby to say the least. 4. Water taps and running water available in each tent. 5. Food is average and not bad actually. If you have a car, you may go and explore",Soumen N,/Profile/S0umenN,Delhi,20
tehri-gharwal,"For 1500 pp breakfast and dinner included in one camp with good basic facilities such as western seats, wash basins however no hot water and mattresses were a little hard but I guess that adds to the whole adventure and camping experience.  The location is perfect with good views of the Uttarakashi and Himalayan ranges. Excellent parking facility : private parking space available.  Jimmy the dog is also very friendly.  Food was good : served us chicken in dinner and also got eggs/omelettes for  breakfast and alloo paranthas.  A worth it experience - the price was also very nominal considering bon fire was also included.",TarangTravels,/Profile/TarangTravels,"Ghaziabad, India",50

tehri-gharwal,"I stayed at Camp Calista during last week of December'16, Sorry for the late review ;)... wonderful stay we had there. We were 3 bikers on a ride from delhi and we found this place really worth riding for these many kilometers. Food spread is not too lavished but that is how it is supposed to be in such adventurous places. the staff was very very helpful to accommodate your needs (if appropriate). Special thanks to staff members for helping us out when one of our bikes didn't start due to minus temperature and they helped us pushing it up to the road...Hats off to you guys. Thank you so much for your support. We shall visit for longer duration during end of this year too ..Cheers ",Amit Sethi,/Profile/Aamitt,"New Delhi, India",50

tehri-gharwal,We did an over night camping there with friends and family in march this year. This camping site is located at almost 8300ft. above sea level at very best spot in dhanaulti. This was only site where parking is in house.mobile connectivity was  not regular but in camps we get some signals but as we want to remain cut from the outside world. The resort had tents set up on two step levels of the mountain.we took larger tents with attached bathrooms. The tents were huge with rot iron beds and comfortable linen and one of the best quilts ever found in camps.but i will say if you r for camping go with open mind and enjoy the beauty.we ask for separate bonfire and after that it was awesome in front of snow clad peaks straight in front of our eyes and we lost in that sight and sit there,joginderchhabra24,/Profile/joginderchhabra24,"New Delhi, India",50
tehri-gharwal,The time you reach to the campsite you get to have a spectacular view of the Himalayas in front of your camp. The view gives you a great feeling and the stay add on the experience with a nice services from the staff.  Food was great with a nice bonfire in the evening with cool wind blowing. The stay in the tents is very comfortable along with the attached bathroom with spacious tent space. I dont know why and how people have rated there experience as bad but we have been coming here since so many years and also suggested this property to many of my friends and the feedback has always been nice n grows better. They also provide a local excursions too. BE prepared for less phone networks that will give more peace. Have also viewed the snow here so its the best place to be in the,Himalayan Lama,/Profile/Himalayan_Lama,"Dehradun, India",40

tehri-gharwal,"To start with, I have been to a lot of camping resorts, and this one is not even worth reviewing.   We were a group of 5, hoping for a relaxing 2 day stay,  however the place was so mismanaged that we decided to leave the very next morning.   The camp site was very dirty and unhygienic. The food quality and taste was bad. In the evening when it was time for bonfire,  you expect a good ambience with all the camp residents gathering around a single bonfire,  however the camp staff preferred to light multiple small bonfires for each group, which literally killed the fun of camping in first place.   The beds were dirty and the camp itself was in a very shabby state.   If you prefer going to a camping resort,  please don't pick this one.",Milan3103,/Profile/Milan3103,"Faridabad, India",10
tehri-gharwal,"when we went there the local guy called up someone (the owner maybe), the booking on cleartrip was done 2 days back, but I was suddenly told that you should bring a print out in the middle of the forest, and moreover it was an instruction made to me by some stupid fellow on the phone when I have the mail copy on my phone/laptop etc, super stupid I must say. Water goes off suddenly in the evening in toilets, so you have to steal it from the overhead tanks in the morning, the tents are almost open from the bottom so there is a high risk of any reptile to walk in and have fun with you for the night, we asked for drinking water atleast 7 times but we never got one, no network coverage of airtel mobiles, no wifi, if it shows on the website ""IT IS JUST NOT THERE"", food is pathetic.",Shirish D,/Profile/ShirishD1,"New Delhi, India",10
tehri-gharwal,"We were 6 boys . We took a camp which was enough for all of us to sleep  Rooms were clean and the washroom was also good except the water flow. There is scarcity of water in hilly areas. location was very good , view from outside the camp was worth it plus in the night we were allowed to play loud music and two huge speakers were provided by the owner. So in all it was a good experience. One can go there and relax, which is the best part about it 'peace'.",rishab j,/Profile/RIshabh5,"New Delhi, India",40

tehri-gharwal,"The worst place to visit. Everything except the location is terrible. The resort is untidy. Broken tables and chairs. The caretaker Mr Michael is mostly unavailable and comes back late evening drunk. The resort is mostly taken care by 2 kids aged 10-15 (yes my friends might be Child labor, though they might also be related to the owner/caretaker not sure about that) but they were the only one doing everything from bringing food, water, cleaning rooms etc. With only one more adult who was the cook and hence would not leave the kitchen. The price was high and we had agreed thinking the service would be good, but it was to the contrary. I gave them my license which they were supposed to xerox and return next morning and they conveniently lost it. The food is average and the",Dipanshu G,/Profile/dipanshug,New Delhi,10

tehri-gharwal,"I went to this place with a group of 25 friends from office. We stayed in tents. Most tents have attached toilets. Like every hill camp, there is water shortage, but staff can get you a bucket of water, in case there is none in the tap.  May be because of the large number of people in the group, the staff was not able to manage the food service properly. They were usually late for the service, through the taste was good.  Hot water is available on demand.  If you are going with children or elderly opt for the rooms instead of tents.",Prasenjit Bose,/Profile/bosepra,"Bengaluru, India",30

tehri-gharwal,"I stayed at the camp in June '13. The location was refreshing and the service was extremely depressing. Upon our arrival at 2.30 pm, we were offered limited lunch and when we asked for tea after the lunch in the cold weather; we were blatantly refused by none other than the main caretaker of the camp. Moments later we saw a tea kettle being served to a family in a nearby tent.  Out of the two nights, we had decent service for the first night; which was probably because the owners of the tents were alongside us for quite some time. On the second night, there were around 30 guests, most of whom consumed non-veg; but, were unable to get a satisfactory quantity because of the limited availability.  The most frustrating moment was when the owners of the tent told us on 2nd morning",uppalbrothers,/Profile/uppalbrothers,"New Delhi, India",10

Somehow we managed to get us accommodated in a tent which was lacked basic hygiene, cleanliness and had foul smells. We again had to approach the management for getting the tent set and fit enough to be in a habitable condition. The management even lacked basic amenities like water and electricity.   On both the nights in spite of the fact the dinner was supposed to be served as buffet, there was shortage of food and we had to sleep with zilch  food.
