tehri-gharwal,"Atali Ganga is one of my favorite places on this planet; I continue to return.  13 of us enjoyed a week stay 2020 February - our third visit.  As usual, everything was delightful - from the food, to the gardens + rooms (spotlessly clean), to the views and the activities... our experience was top notch.   I could sit on the patio with a cup of chai & good company and look at the river and the mountains for hours.    I deeply respect Atali's commitment to the environment and responsible tourism; a rarity, I've found, in my travels in India.

We drove down from Dehradun airport, which was around 1.5 hours by road. Check in was smooth and efficient, and the staff warm & inviting.   While moving to our cottage we noticed that the entire resort appears to be bathed in a sea of green. There are trees & flowers everywhere and even a vegetable garden.  Our cottage was nestled in the greenery and had a beautiful view of the surrounding mountains. It was a great feeling waking up to this beautiful sight!

Care for the environment is very noticeable - so no fancy shampoos or tissues -  but the whole resort is meticulously kept and maintained. The staff were fantastic and very attentive - as it turned out we were the only guests while we were there which was a bit unusual - and the food was delicious - they have a great chef who checked with us before each meal to ensure that the food was just what we wanted.

There are beautiful cottages with greenery, natural plantations, comfort and good buffet spreads. And all this with an exposure to the activities on offer - hiking, rafting, kaykaying. All inclusive.

What needs to be worked upon? Some leisure activities like Spa, yoga, etc need to be added for those not very keen to work out their bodies with adventure sports. Swimming pool needs to be heated to make it usable. An open hot water jacuzzi will be a crowd puller.

The room size is a disappointment as there is no sitting area within the room. While each cottage has a sit-out, it is not always possible to use it especially in rain and in extreme sunlight. We had an 8 year old child with us and after placing the extra bed for her on the floor, there was literally no circulation space on one side. The washrooms and dresser area are decently sized though I wish they could have taken",Karishma K,/Profile/KarishmaK319,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30

There are around 21-22 cottages and each cottage carries a well designated name. Like our cottage was named – Dibang, tributary of river Brahamputra. The place is unsuitable for old aged persons as there is a fair good amount of usage of stairs going by the way property has been developed.  Both, check in  and check out were very smooth.

It's a lovely secluded spot by the river where you can spend hours just reading a book or taking a nap. Its a short walk down the road but they will also arrange for a pick/drop and a picnic if requested.  A big let down was the food.

tehri-gharwal,"Stayed with my family for four nights in April '15. Perfect balance of functionality and comfort. Food was simple fare but very tasty and safely prepared. Staff were great. Lots of options for activities. Felt that rafting and kayaking were more pedestrian than necessary. Rafting in particular, while great fun, seemed more about keeping to time than participation. This meant that we were mainly passengers and rarely called upon to paddle....lots of drifting. Great for families that want to just experience rafting, but gets a bit dull if you really want to get stuck in. Having said that, we went rafting twice, so this is a minor point and more of a request to the team to allow pax to engage more, or check their desire to be more engaged.

The management and staff were warm and helpful, the food was excellent, the rooms extremely comfortable, and the views simply stunning. This is the short version. The long review is below for those interested.  The Property:  While the address shows the resort as being in Rishikesh, it's actually about 25 km or so beyond Rishikesh town, on the road to Devprayag/Badrinath. This is a good thing, really, as Rishikesh is quite crowded with tourists and temple-goers alike, which can ruin the point of a vacation in the hills. The beauty and tranquility of the resort, however, makes the slog through Rishikesh worth it. The resort is set on a hill-side, facing the river",M_adinterim,/Profile/M_adinterim,"New Delhi, India",50

Extremely well organised by Aquaterra with great staff. Special mention for Manoj. All other activities are good as well. All the meals were good and service staff are very courteous. We were being looked after Jitu and he made sure we were comfortable, relaxed and enjoyed our stay. No T.V. or wifi in the rooms is a massive boon.

tehri-gharwal,First thing if u are not interested in rafting or trekking this is not the place for you nor for elderly who are looking for leisure holidaying. overall nice place good location right above bank of Ganges. Nothing to do inside the resort except climbing the stairs they hav small swimming pool too but that u can enjoy only in may or june i suppose as we visited in january. Restaurant and food is really good. Evening barbecue is really nice .one can carry ones Liquor and they serve it with good snacks. Sunita is really active and will keep on encouraging you to do one or other activities. Road outside resort is very busy even during night time .very heavy traffic trucks buses on the road so you can not take a stroll which we really missed.

Rightfully so, the trudge up and down the steps  definitely helped the appetite. Pick rooms closer to the restaurant if you are hesitant to trudge up and down. The food is simple, fabulous and positively delicious. Do not however expect a menu card for food in the mountains.

The rooms are simply 5 star standards in the form of different cottages on mountain. The rafting experience with Aquaterra Adventures is the longest they do at Rishikesh and safest as well. Moreover, you do the rafting with very good set of people!!  The point where Atali beats everything are their superb staff. The most helpful person is Vikram who would guide you like a family member. He manages rafting, high ropes at Atali (don't miss this if you want to loose few thousands of calories!!), and every small to big need of yours!! Other staff is also as caring as it can be!!

We reached there in the evening and after a quick orientation from the staff took a refreshing dip in the pool.

The rafting was a huge attraction, but getting the right partner to get this done lead us to Atali.   Vaibhav assured us that this would be taken care and sure they did. They were very responsive of our changing needs due to delayed flights and made our trip memorable. Dinner by the river, quality of the rooms/service/food - awesome.

Rooms and facilities are clean and most of the staff is helpful, however the managerial staff could be more so. They have a range of activities from rock climbing, white water rafting to treking  which are very good.  Now the cons - No room for accompanying driver, they will send you 3-4 kms away and make you pay for  boarding and lodging. - Quite costly, even though the experience and facilities are good. Make sure you negotiate well upfront. - No room service - No bar / liquor facility even though the room rates are in the 5 star category - No TV in the rooms - Managerial staff could be more amiable, you almost get the feeling of arrogance at times",SundeepGoel,/Profile/SundeepGoel,"Faridabad, India",40

The open spaces and events make it a beautiful place to spend active/relaxed days and evenings. The cottages are built on on mountain side. A lush green mountain opposite and Ganga flowing below, specked with occassional rafts and Kayaks, forms a great scenery to wake up to.. It is great place for people who want to stay physically active during the break with multiple events to choose from during the day.

What a beautiful name - the name itself got some pics entrenched in my imagination, and I must say, it turned out to be far better! We chose it over all the other options that offered a tent or camp style setting. The location is perfect -on the hilltop that gives a  breathtaking view of the valley and the serene Ganga. Its like an instant pill of relaxation of body, mind and soul! Their service is prompt, polite and friendly. Personally, being a stickler for hygeine, I'd give them a very high score.

While the two runs on the Ganga under the guidance of excellent rafters pumped up the adrenalin, the truly distinctive feature of this property was the high rope course – very challenging! It pretty much tested the limits. The instructors were very helpful and encouraging and even offered a second try to the kids who couldn’t complete it on the first try. The beach access for kayaking and just beach time for the little ones is another plus. The staff at Atali are attentive and make every effort to make sure that everyone’s having fun.
