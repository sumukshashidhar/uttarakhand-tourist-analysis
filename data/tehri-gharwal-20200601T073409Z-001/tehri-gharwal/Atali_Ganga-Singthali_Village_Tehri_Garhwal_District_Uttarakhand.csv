tehri-gharwal,"Atali Ganga is one of my favorite places on this planet; I continue to return.  13 of us enjoyed a week stay 2020 February - our third visit.  As usual, everything was delightful - from the food, to the gardens + rooms (spotlessly clean), to the views and the activities... our experience was top notch.   I could sit on the patio with a cup of chai & good company and look at the river and the mountains for hours.    I deeply respect Atali's commitment to the environment and responsible tourism; a rarity, I've found, in my travels in India.

We drove down from Dehradun airport, which was around 1.5 hours by road. Check in was smooth and efficient, and the staff warm & inviting.   While moving to our cottage we noticed that the entire resort appears to be bathed in a sea of green. There are trees & flowers everywhere and even a vegetable garden.  Our cottage was nestled in the greenery and had a beautiful view of the surrounding mountains. It was a great feeling waking up to this beautiful sight!

Then why not have a slope instead of stairs. We are fit.

There are beautiful cottages with greenery, natural plantations, comfort and good buffet spreads. And all this with an exposure to the activities on offer - hiking, rafting, kaykaying. All inclusive.

The property aptly described by Manoj, who manages the place as a Vertical Property is an intriguing property. Each room is well equipped for a couple is tastefully furnished and has a lovely view.

What needs to be worked upon? Some leisure activities like Spa, yoga, etc need to be added for those not very keen to work out their bodies with adventure sports. Swimming pool needs to be heated to make it usable. An open hot water jacuzzi will be a crowd puller.

tehri-gharwal,"We stayed at Atali during one of our trips to Rishikesh last year while traveling with friends and family. Booked the hotel based on the reviews we had heard. The hotel is located away from the crowded parts of Rishikesh which is a big plus.The small trek up to the restaurant and the cottages is also a good experience, though it may get difficult for the elderly. The room size is a disappointment as there is no sitting area within the room. While each cottage has a sit-out, it is not always possible to use it especially in rain and in extreme sunlight. We had an 8 year old child with us and after placing the extra bed for her on the floor, there was literally no circulation space on one side. The washrooms and dresser area are decently sized though I wish they could have taken",Karishma K,/Profile/KarishmaK319,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30

Its a short walk down the road but they will also arrange for a pick/drop and a picnic if requested.  A big let down was the food.

tehri-gharwal,"Stayed with my family for four nights in April '15. Perfect balance of functionality and comfort. Food was simple fare but very tasty and safely prepared. Staff were great. Lots of options for activities. Felt that rafting and kayaking were more pedestrian than necessary. Rafting in particular, while great fun, seemed more about keeping to time than participation. This meant that we were mainly passengers and rarely called upon to paddle....lots of drifting. Great for families that want to just experience rafting, but gets a bit dull if you really want to get stuck in. Having said that, we went rafting twice, so this is a minor point and more of a request to the team to allow pax to engage more, or check their desire to be more engaged.

The management and staff were warm and helpful, the food was excellent, the rooms extremely comfortable, and the views simply stunning. This is the short version. The long review is below for those interested.  The Property:  While the address shows the resort as being in Rishikesh, it's actually about 25 km or so beyond Rishikesh town, on the road to Devprayag/Badrinath. This is a good thing, really, as Rishikesh is quite crowded with tourists and temple-goers alike, which can ruin the point of a vacation in the hills. The beauty and tranquility of the resort, however, makes the slog through Rishikesh worth it. The resort is set on a hill-side, facing the river",M_adinterim,/Profile/M_adinterim,"New Delhi, India",50

Extremely well organised by Aquaterra with great staff. Special mention for Manoj. All other activities are good as well. All the meals were good and service staff are very courteous. We were being looked after Jitu and he made sure we were comfortable, relaxed and enjoyed our stay. No T.V. or wifi in the rooms is a massive boon.

tehri-gharwal,First thing if u are not interested in rafting or trekking this is not the place for you nor for elderly who are looking for leisure holidaying. overall nice place good location right above bank of Ganges. Nothing to do inside the resort except climbing the stairs they hav small swimming pool too but that u can enjoy only in may or june i suppose as we visited in january. Restaurant and food is really good. Evening barbecue is really nice .one can carry ones Liquor and they serve it with good snacks. Sunita is really active and will keep on encouraging you to do one or other activities. Road outside resort is very busy even during night time .very heavy traffic trucks buses on the road so you can not take a stroll which we really missed.

We tried our hand at adventure, had our moments of peace, good food and yes..we will visit again. Tip: There is no room service for food. Rightfully so, the trudge up and down the steps  definitely helped the appetite. Pick rooms closer to the restaurant if you are hesitant to trudge up and down. The food is simple, fabulous and positively delicious. Do not however expect a menu card for food in the mountains.

The rooms are simply 5 star standards in the form of different cottages on mountain. The rafting experience with Aquaterra Adventures is the longest they do at Rishikesh and safest as well. Moreover, you do the rafting with very good set of people!!  The point where Atali beats everything are their superb staff. The most helpful person is Vikram who would guide you like a family member.

The rafting was a huge attraction, but getting the right partner to get this done lead us to Atali.   Vaibhav assured us that this would be taken care and sure they did. They were very responsive of our changing needs due to delayed flights and made our trip memorable. Dinner by the river, quality of the rooms/service/food - awesome.

We were looking for some peace and quiet and hence, did not take advantage of the rafting, high ropes or any of the other adventures offered here. The only outdoorsy thing we did was to hike behind the resort to a local village - the terrain was quite decent and I would recommend it to everyone who visits. We had the resort pretty much to ourselves while we were there, and initially we felt that the quality of food and service was under par. We immediately spoke to the management and the metaphorical 'socks were pulled up' and 'belts tightened'! The cottages are well-designed and the entire property very well-maintained.

Now the cons - No room for accompanying driver, they will send you 3-4 kms away and make you pay for  boarding and lodging. - Quite costly, even though the experience and facilities are good. Make sure you negotiate well upfront. - No room service - No bar / liquor facility even though the room rates are in the 5 star category - No TV in the rooms - Managerial staff could be more amiable, you almost get the feeling of arrogance at times",SundeepGoel,/Profile/SundeepGoel,"Faridabad, India",40

What a beautiful name - the name itself got some pics entrenched in my imagination, and I must say, it turned out to be far better! We chose it over all the other options that offered a tent or camp style setting. The location is perfect -on the hilltop that gives a  breathtaking view of the valley and the serene Ganga. Its like an instant pill of relaxation of body, mind and soul! Their service is prompt, polite and friendly. Personally, being a stickler for hygeine, I'd give them a very high score.
