tehri-gharwal,"Recently i visited this camp in kanatal and the camp is situated at a very prime location just next to the club mahindra kanatal, so it was very easy to get there. The best part of the camp is their beautiful and scenic view of nature. The staff of the camp were very polite and helpful. The rooms were very clean. Now comes the food part and it is amazing. They cook fresh meals every day and the food was delicious. And the staff over there makes sure that you feel like your home.  Overall i loved my stay in this camp and surely i would go again.

The service was very poor and they said this is the end of the season. they were not listing to any one. whosoever was paying extra money like tip apart from package they were focusing on them only. They restrict us to keep the food for our friends who were coming late, said every one has to eat on the same time. Room were also not clean and if you ask for new bed sheet they will say that store is close now. Weather was so cool, we enjoyed a lot even after this poor behavior by staff. food was ok done expect too much. not worth it as per the price.

tehri-gharwal,"To be candid I was invited to visit this location, at the behest of the ownership, so I cannot comment on anything based on cost. Based on the reviews I have to admit I was expecting far better than what was offered. To be clear it was in the middle of winter, -2 out, and I'm sure that impacted things more than a little. However, aside from that there was no luxury, there wasn't even hot water available (and we had to raise a fuss to even get col water). The entire place is well laid out but very rustic, for example the dinning area was not picturesque, it was more akin to eating inside a shipping container. Probably the best food you'll ever have in a shipping container come to that! The tents were clean, albeit spartan, but I didn't spend much time there given the temperatures",GlobeGuides,/Profile/GlobeGuides,Washington D.C.,20
