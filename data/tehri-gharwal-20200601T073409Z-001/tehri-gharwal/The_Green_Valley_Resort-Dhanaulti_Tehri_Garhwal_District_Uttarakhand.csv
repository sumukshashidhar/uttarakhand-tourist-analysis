tehri-gharwal,This is worst hospitality that i have ever received.  There is no water no electricity and terrible food with extra charges and charges for room is not worth it.  They are not even providing basic toiletries.,Sorab yaduvanshi,/Profile/Emopunk13,,10
tehri-gharwal,"This is one of the worst hotel i have ever found in my life, no electricity, no water and moreover toilets are unhygenic, across the road there is public toilet which is used by visitors, And moreover pathetic food...but there charges are approx 2000 for a room which is quite high as compared to services they offer so i suggest to visit in Dhanaulti, I dont even understand how they have got OYO membership as they dont provide basic need like soap & shampoo. Last but not least this is not resort so dont book it online by just looking the picture of rooms.",Giriraj Gandhi,/Profile/Gpal2503,,10
tehri-gharwal,"Post trying all possible way the only negative point I can come up with is they serve too much food.  Jokes apart! This is a lovely place and very new too. All private cottages with pvt Balcony for your privacy. Foods are served to your room thus if you really do not want, you dont even have to step out of the cottage. The bedroom side wall is of glass giving you a picture perfect view of the valley and mountain. The ammenities are of any branded property with room heater and geyser. A sofa is placed in the room for you to relax and watch over the sunset across the mountain. Mr. Binay is the owner and he is always approachable over the phone. Ramesh is the go to guy there, he can help you in all possible way. The menu is limited but delicious, every item on it is prepared",Rounak G,/Profile/rounakg122,"Hyderabad, India",50
