tehri-gharwal,"I run a Backpackers community and took a corporate batch to Meadow Heights this January. From the Efficiency of the service to the quality of the camps to the behaviour of the staff, everything was exceptional and trust me, this is coming from someone who has travelled extensively across India for the last 4 years. I would highly recommend this place to any family or Company or a group of friends to just go sit in the lap of Tehri Mountains and have the time of your life. Special cheers for the camp manager Mr. Shiv Ram.",Jatin Ahuja,/Profile/wildernama,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
tehri-gharwal,"Let me share the whole story, we were willing to go to kanatal camps, but due to unavailability ,we had to choose Meadow Heights..!!! But seriously, at last, we didn't regret our decision. Our stay at Meadow Heights camps was just awesome. This can be concluded in some points: 1. Neat and clean camps, bedsheets and blankets were clean  2. Tasty food just like restaurant and hot food is served. 3. Adventure activities were worth  4. Cooperative staff 5. Peaceful and scenic beauty , both are here.",sakshimehandiratta5,/Profile/sakshimehandiratta5,,50

tehri-gharwal,I with my family planed to visit Tehri and near by place on new year and we got a reference for Chamba. We stayed at camp site which is only 18 km from Tehri and 12 km from Chamba. Really nice place and beautiful location having friendly environment and staff. We like food and was hygienic for my kids. Tents are also good with proper bedding which is comfortable and clean also having attached toilets with tent. Great meadows team keep it up. Thank u Shivram manager,Neeti S,/Profile/NeetiS66,,50
