tehri-gharwal,"Being a regular traveller to Rishikesh for my weekend holiday this time i selected Black pearl as my holiday destination. Awesome place, good facilities and decent staff. Food is tasty and served hot. ",Nikhil J,/Profile/186nikhilj,,50
tehri-gharwal,"We were group of 4 girls who went for camping. As it was weekday, there were only two more guests other than us. Initially, I was abit unsure about safe stay, as it is an adventure camping and we were only girls there. But our stay was really safe and amazing. We enjoyed alot. The staff was very kind and helpful. Food was also good. Only one small problem faced was that, lights were not there in all washrooms. Washrooms hygiene can be improved. Otherwise, a good place for adventure camping. The view from the camp is super awesome. Small river flowing near by. Recommended for your gang.",Mansi L,/Profile/MansiL17,,40
tehri-gharwal,It was good experience being there however sometimes the staff sounded arrogant. Food is ok and tent near to river flowing just 100 mtrs. It's difficult to stay in tent during summer since it's too hot.,Nitin S,/Profile/nitins821,,30
tehri-gharwal,Food quality is good and staff is supportive. Well there is no music but everything gone quite well. You can try Bhagnaja trek there as this trek is hidden no one knows about it except our group. Keep searching !,Anshul,/Profile/akbansa,"Bengaluru, India",40
tehri-gharwal,This was a really bad experience as there was no proper facilities available. There were so many mosquitoes and it was very hot too. The dinner/lunch place is so bad and they never provided it on time...there are flies all around...even a dharmshala is better. We shifted out from this place within 3 hours. You cannot expect a nice holiday here. Every customer there was unsatisfied by the service they provided.,Dhruvi A,/Profile/DhruviA5,,10
