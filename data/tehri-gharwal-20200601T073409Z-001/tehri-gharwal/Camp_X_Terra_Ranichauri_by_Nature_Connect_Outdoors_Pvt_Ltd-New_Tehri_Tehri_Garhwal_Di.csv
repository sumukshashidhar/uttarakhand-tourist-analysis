tehri-gharwal,I went to camp x Terra for a group camp with a few friends. It is a quite well maintained campsite though it gets a bit monotonous. It has okay facilities and it is equipped for most disasters . Enjoyed the quirk of the weather stone Thanks edterra edventures,Ahaan11,/Profile/Ahaan11,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"We, two families, seven members, were there at the campsite for two nights, on June 13 to June 15, 2015.  The experience was amazing.  The approach from Rishikesh, location, weather, activities, food, staff behaviour, cleanliness, ...everything's fantastic. For mid aged couples, there are two bamboo huts / Gazebos with attached washrooms but  please do not expect luxurious tents. They've a beautiful 120 feet rock face for rappelling. Shivram, the chief instructor there is a NIM pass out & is very professional. I'm 46, an Acrophobic but he still made me rappel 120 feet.  The valley crossing is a bit short length but still fun.  Also, they're largely using the world's best quality equipment brand i.e Petzl (France) for activities. I'm from mountaineering equipments background",vipulwahi,/Profile/vipulwahi,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
tehri-gharwal,"This camp is based on the top of a hill at a height of approximately 2000 m and has a complete view of the Himalayan range on clear days. We were lucky that we could stay here, because it is totally off the beaten tourist track. It is a great place to do day hikes to nearby villages, to enjoy bird watching and to be in absolute nature. When we were there, it was the time of the Rhododendron flowers (end of March). There also seems to be a nice 3 day trek from Rishikesh up to this place, but we did not do that. The camp staff organised rock climbing and challenging rappelling in a nearby area. We stayed in a tent, which was clean, had beds and bed sheets. There are also cottages available. Food was very good.",Ama99,/Profile/Ama99,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",40
tehri-gharwal,"I visited the camp X terra twice in a gap of less than a month. The initial doubts etc were dispelled as soon as I as we arrived at the camp site.Located in an apple orchard is a row of camps and cottages.They provide all amenities and one feels like being in a jungle yet the town and all its facilities are not far away. The weather was superb and even in the extreme summer of June, we were forced to wear light woolens. The food had a lot of variety from early morning tea to the dinner.The toilets ,even though common, were kept clean and tidy by the staff. There is some water supply constraints but it was well managed by the team of the camp.  The adventure specialists Ajay and Shiva are great guys.They planned a 7 hours grueling hill trek filled with challenging games and",Maneesh1970,/Profile/Maneesh1970,"New Delhi, India",50

tehri-gharwal,"Being an adventure enthusiast and the founder of a travel company, I recommend Camp X-Terra for all those looking for adventure without compromising on the quality of accommodation and service. Camp X-Terra was the preferred camp with my last organisation as well as now for me in my own venture. All the groups that have been to the camp have come back satisfied with the adventure and the staff. They have all specially loved the food and the peaceful surroundings.  Being from the same industry, I understand the quality of equipment for the adventure activities. The equipment used by X-Terra Team is world class and their safety standards are high. The camp is recommended for both families and corporate groups.",RohitRidlan,/Profile/RohitRidlan,"New Delhi, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"I had visited the Ranichauri Camp of Nature Connect in early 2014 with a few of my friends. The entry to the camp itself indicated to us that we were about to have an adventurous time here. Inspite of it being off-season, the tents were neat and clean, the staff was available for us whenever we needed them and the food was awesome. The adventure activities specialists there went out of their way to ensure we enjoyed the adventure activities, as they were very encouraging. Me and my friends recommend the camp to everyone who is looking for a couple of days away from the mayhem of city, a rustic environment, some adventure and a breathtaking view of snow clad peaks early morning.",AnushaSeth,/Profile/AnushaSeth,"Noida, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"Camp X-Terra has been a great experience. It was my first time on an actual camp and i totally enjoyed it. It was worth the time and energy we put in visiting this place. The staff is totally amazing. They offer personal attention to each and every person who visits it and are extremely helpful. They took us for long treks early in the morning and also made us do the various activities like valley crossing, rope ladder climbing in the campsite itself. The campsite too is extremely picturesque. We enjoyed living in the midst of nature for 2 full days. The camp staff even took us for rappelling and patiently explained us the process and were extremely calm when we were frightened to do it. I would highly recommend this campsite for anyone who wishes to have a gala time with either",Akriti45,/Profile/Akriti45,"Faridabad, India",50

tehri-gharwal,"I have visited here numerous times and have never left disappointed! The camp is set amongst an apple orchard, with breathtaking views of the Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Nanda Devi group of peaks, with simple, comfortable and clean tented accommodation and a few bamboo huts. Run by a fantastic, passionate, professional and highly-qualified team of outdoor enthusiasts,  this camp caters perfectly to those seeking a gentle introduction to the mountain wilderness of lower Garhwal. The bird diversity here is very worth exploring. Oh, and the food is just exquisite! :)",Suniti D,/Profile/sunitid,"Dehradun, India",50

tehri-gharwal,"I and a couple of my friends landed up here in Oct 2012, the place was still up for renovation but Mr. Ajay was very welcoming and said that he can accommodate us , he even offered us a discount as we were a group of students. The place itself is a traveller's paradise with the picturesque mountains. The serenity of the place is overwhelming. The owner even arranged a night camp for three of us , which required us to trek for a couple of hours, with all arrangements of food and tents for the night. Our trek leader Shivram also kept us entertained with numerous stories about some awesome treks. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience of making our own food in the forest. The next day we went back to the campsite, and from there went for rapelling to a nearby mountain rock face which",Pawan R,/Profile/pawanr2013,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",50
