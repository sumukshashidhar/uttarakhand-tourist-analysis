tehri-gharwal,"This campsite in total has 25 tents and 2 cottages with attached washrooms, iron beds and 24/7 electricity. The tents are spacious enough to accommodate 3 people.  This place can easily accommodate large groups.  They have an activity area to give you a gist of adventures. You can even go for a trek/ nature walk nearby.  The staff was very cooperative and friendly.  NOTE:  - Meals provided were basic (c'mon guys its a camp, not hotel)  but good  Menu like poori bhaji, bread butter, poha etc  - ROUTE TO TAKE: The preferred route should be via -Mussoorie as Rishikesh route is under construction üöß. - Parking is not a problem.",Sonakshi & Samyak,/Profile/shortsnshots,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"Stayed at camp carnival with friends and family last week. Things that stood out for us were cleanliness in general, great location and courteous staff constantly taking feedbacks and ensuring that service is upto our expectations. Food was good and rooms were neat. It has quite spread out area. Some of the step-farms are east-facing (providing nice morning sunshine) whereas others are west-facing ( that hold good amount of snow even after couple of weeks of snow fall). Having stayed at multiple camps at Kanatal, can say that this was my best experience so far. ",Pankaj G,/Profile/pgairola,"Noida, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"Camps in this area have more or less same facilities and and available services. However Camp Carnival stands out from others on account of its better services and courteous staff, always ready to help. We just walked into this camp as we got fedup with the one one we were staying and with in 5 minutes we decided to move in. I would say it was a good decision which paid off in terms of excellent service (thanks to Mr. Venkatesh , the manager) which included a nice and personalized bon-fire , neat and clean tents, sumptuous food , in general hygienic environment, all coming at a very reasonable cost. I would recommend this camp in this area as value for money proposition.",Ashwin S,/Profile/ashwinsahay,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
tehri-gharwal,We 3 couple with kids went to Kanatal to enjoy the snowfall. Earlier we had booked ourselves in a resort after hearing rave reviews but the shabby quality and the service made us cut short our stay. While walking around we came across this somewhat non descript place. Taking a chance we booked this place for 1 night. This indeed turned out to be a very good move as this place is very clean well maintained and headed by an exceptionally customer friendly manager Mr Venkatesh. Not only was he always supportive but also going the extra mile to ensure customer delight. He handled tricky situations with finesse and tact thereby ensuring all his guests remain happy. Typically in hill stations kitchens shut down bit early in evening and hotel management compels guests to have their,hpant,/Profile/hpant,"Noida, India",50

tehri-gharwal,"Was initially hesitant to leave the comfort of a hotel and stay in a camp. Had extensively done research and had found mixed reviews of camp stays, including Camp Carnival. Decided to try it out after insistence from spouse who had a pleasant experience with this camp, and can say it ended as a good 2 days spent here. Folks from other groups were fun to be with and we enjoyed the bonfire to the core. The camp facilities were up-to-the mark and clean. Even the food was good. Being a foodie, good food is a MUST HAVE for me.

tehri-gharwal," We were a large family group who wanted to try out something different this summer and ended up searching for a camping site. We stayed in two of them and surveyed a lot many.  Camp Carnival was undoubtedly the best in business. The camps are set up in quite a large area under whistling pine trees and lush green vegetation. Camps are just about far enough from each other to ensure privacy. The attached washrooms are neat and clean with water supply - though hot water gets served from a central hot water tank on demand.   Food has variety and is very tasty - you will need variety if you stay more than two nights. The bread pakoras in the evening snacks were awesome in the cold weather, and the mutton curry and Chinese fare served up for dinner was lip smacking.

We arrived in morning of Saturday and soon after our very heavy breakfast, we proceed for activity in nearby jungle. The person who was conducting all these activity seemed very professional and doing it in very nice way . We covered Rock climbing and rappelling in first half.

My suggestions: Camps above No.20 are far away from the Dining Area which needs to be improved compared to other tents.  Inside the camps & attached bathrooms cum toilet -  need improvement, with hot water running in the bathrooms, otherwise it will give a dull feeling while entering into the camp and attached bathroom.
