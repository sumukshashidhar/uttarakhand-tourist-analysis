tehri-gharwal,"3 Families with lots of kids spent 4 nights on the camp. The camp is amazing. The staff work very hard to show you a good time. The facilities are outstanding including the hot meals. What was great for us was the attention to safety while rafting. An added advantage is you always meet great people on the camp, typically over a drink around the bonfire.  A must do experience.  We travelled from Bombay,first to delhi and then the shatabdi to Haridwar and finally a 2 hr drive to camp.It is easier to just fly into Dehradun and drive from there.",Rajiv366,/Profile/Rajiv366,,50
tehri-gharwal,"I went on a three day-two night rafting trip on the Ganges with my 7 year old son and another family with 2 children. We were very surprised by the camp, beds were provided in the tent, there were actual toilets (sand flush) and running water to wash your hands. Water was heated each day for showers. The meals and snacks were incredible - the best we had on our whole trip to India. The staff were involved and always and present. They joined in many games of beach volleyball. The kids loved the activities like a small zip-line in the forest.     The rafting was quite good, equipment was great and very safe. They had the right size life jackets and helmets for children.  An all around great trip!",Marilyn12_81,/Profile/Marilyn12_81,"St. John's, Canada",50
tehri-gharwal,"Decent Camps with good supportive staff, full of adventure and fun. Economical and just right infront of the ganges. they give you a package, which includes all the meals and rafting. In one word the experience was awesome and definately will visit again for 32 kms rafting..:D",pallavi_pal,/Profile/pallavi_pal,"New Delhi, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"went on end of year family rafting expedition with mhe - organised by the mhe beach camp. called the alaknanda expedition, we took three days to raft down from dev prayag to the mhe beach camp. the staff were very well trained, the equipment used is world class, all safety precautions are adhered to. the food we had was the most amazing, specially for a beach camp location - kudos to the chef, Dev.",entdr,/Profile/entdr,"New Delhi, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"We had booked 2 tents with MHE for a long weekend in April-end. Though the camp-site was beautiful, it seemed MHE had overbooked to cash-in on the weekend rush. Despite theirs being the highest package, welcome n treatment was shoddy..no arrangement for carryiwas ng of  luggage, poorly laid out food, lack of availability of gear for rafting, poorly planned transport up till the rafting site. We were so helpless as they had taken the entire amount as advance. Many others who were there said that when they had first come to MHE they were really impressed but this time it a horrible experience. The place, Ganges and the sheer fun of rafting with friends made up for poor arrangements by MHE. Would recommend part-payment after seeing the facilities. I'm surely going for another camp",Mani2406,/Profile/Mani2406,"New Delhi, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"My last visit to MHE was like every visit since 1996 at this place which has become our home way from home. I have visited at different times with friends and others with family(including once with our 6 month old daughter) and each time has been heavenly. The smiling, energetic fun loving staff are trained to keep you safe and passionate about making each visit fun. The food especially the dinners are memorable thanks to the food, the star filled skies and the cool air. The tents are roomy, comfortable and clean as are the toilets. The pleasure of a bath with hamaam heated waters in open topped cabanas is divine and its location across the road just adds to the feeling that the 'real' world is far away. I am already excited about my next weekend at camp. A must visit. Don't",Mayur Sharma,/Profile/worldonmyplate,"New Delhi, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"The camp would be surely one of the best camps in shivpuri, it is very clean , offers good service and give you excellent food.The tents in the camp are of average size and beds are jsut a bit cosy.  It has a large beach to roam around and play volley ball and badminton.Would recommend this place to fellow travellers.",touseef,/Profile/touseef,newdelhi,40
tehri-gharwal,"Enter Shivpuri and there is flood of humanity, stocked like cattel in a farm. Over crowded camps is the only sight and that is the only thing which can spoil my trip. A 15 min walk off the highway and you are on the banks of the great Ganga. At this point you would have left the madness and the noise behind, in your sight, across the river is the MHE Shivpuri Beach Camp. The only way to reach the camp is being ferried across by the camp rafts and trust me if its first time the only word to discribe the ride is ""awesome"". One is amazed at the skill of the guides ferring you across. The camp is clean, i could not find a single bottel cap until city dwellers like me arive to dirty it. I could go on and on about the hospitality, food, comfortable tents bla bla bla. Id just say it is",Aman231287,/Profile/Aman231287,"Chandigarh, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"Peace, tranquility, service and food that was amazing. The location is one of a kind with the Ganga in her complete splendor running right outside your tent. You can go with a group of friends or by yourself and get the excitement or solitude you want! There is enough to do and more! I would rate it as 2 thumbs up!",rads62,/Profile/rads62,"Faridabad, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"Probably the only rafting and outdoor camp, where safety is a priority. Location and ambience is an add on plus point of this Camp.    One of the finest beaches on the river shore- so clean makes one wonder whether we are in India.. !!! The nights at their beach is the rarest of experience. The Bonfire with a guitarist singing ( unplugged versions) with a good round of pakoras, added to the merriment along with our own booze. No cops around to shut down the party !!!  The Tents- the cheapest one is as good as the costliest one with the staff taking care of Additional Lanterns, Drinking Water, Warm Water, Hot water bottles, additional Quilts with no fuss.   Food is what our mom would have cooked for us... it prompts you to have few helpings more than what you would do on a normal",Jindz,/Profile/Jindz,New Delhi,50
tehri-gharwal,"A first camping & rafting trip for. MHE made it so easy with thebooking process and the actual dilevery of services, we could not have asked for more !!!  The location by the Ganga is to die for. None of the other camps in Shivpuri even come close. The staff were extremely friendly and kept the entire family and kids occupied.  Safety for MHE seems to be paramount. They instructors seem to know what they do and made this trip something to remember. Night camp fires, awesome food and activities gallore. All in all an AWESOME experience.",bhartinarula,/Profile/bhartinarula,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"It is one of the best located Camp site being across the river and giving you a feel of the rapids, even before you have checked in. The reception is warm the nights are great with bonfire and music. The rapid runs can get anyones adrenal running, the guides who take you on the river are well trained and are not scared of putting you in the middle of the rapid if he feels you can handle it, or do the chicken run for the weak hearted. It was my fourth trip and I'd do it again anyday, because each trip is a new experiance.",guruarjunji,/Profile/guruarjunji,"New Delhi, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"I went to the MHE Shivpuri camp with a bunch of my friends over Holi, and it was truly a splendid experience.   The office in Delhi were brilliant at booking in our trip and dealing with our numerous date changes and general chaos.   The camp itself is beautiful, tucked away around a bend across the Ganga. The staff there, too, went out of their way to make sure we felt the lack of absolutely nothing. The food was delightfully homecooked, the tents were spacious and very comfortable, the loo and shower tents were basic but very clean.   All in all, a wonderful adventure with lots of comfort thrown in.   Thank you to Akshay and his team.",Maya,/Profile/MayaKS,,50

tehri-gharwal,"We stayed at your camp for 3 nights this holi weekend and had the best time ever! The staff is just incredible in their efforts to make everything super efficient and everyone super happy.  Thank you Vishnuji, you're the most unassuming manager, that coupled with your calm smiling face makes you superly awesome. Thanks also to Sanju, both the Pramods, Arjun, Raju, Mitra and all the other staff whose names i dont know.  Special 'love' for Pramod (safety kayak) for his antics on the water!  Thank you very much all you guys at MHE, this was one of our best holidays ever!",suhani_mahajan,/Profile/suhani_mahajan,Delhi,50
tehri-gharwal,"Visited the camp on the 8th of march and stayed for 3 nights. Absolutely fantastic location. Great rafting experience....                                                                                                                       Did the greatest of the rapids on the river, The wall.  Well trained, experienced and friendly rafting guides. Had 'the time of my life' !!! High safety standards, we had an awesome night navigation into the Rajaji national park (the camp is within the national park) with our flashlights. clean surrounding and a very well maintained camp... there is no electricity in any of the camps there but the bonfire we had just before dinner was a memorable one.  I would say... everyone should go for rafting with MHE at least once in their life and see",Kalakoti,/Profile/Kalakoti,"New Delhi, India",50
