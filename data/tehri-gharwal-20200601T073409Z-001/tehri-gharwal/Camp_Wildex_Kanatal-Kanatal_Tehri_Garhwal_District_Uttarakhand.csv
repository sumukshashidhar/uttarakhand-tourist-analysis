tehri-gharwal,"Camp Wildex is located in a forest area, very near to Club Mahindra Resort. It gives you a really beautiful view of the valley and the weather there is awesome. Located in a place all surrounded by trees makes it all the more chilled. The staff is helpful and they cook delicious food; you can't just stop licking your fingers. BUT!! monkeys are a big nuisance there. You can't just get out of your rooms whenever you feel like, especially in the morning. Therefore, it reduces your self-activities too. Also their tents are a big no-no. Not at all luxurious; you will feel like you are staying in an army base camp. I and my family were lucky enough to find their rooms to be empty and we chose to stay there which were satisfactory. The camp did not have much sapce to loiter around and",Bhawna_arya,/Profile/Bhawna_arya,"New Delhi, India",30
tehri-gharwal,"The scenery is nice and view from tents is good. They have Swiss tents which have attached washrooms.They offer three meals, the food is simply cooked but tasty.  Apple orchid is at walkable distance.  Beware of monkeys, often they make their way to tents and seal out eatables.",nannuk2017,/Profile/nannuk2017,,30
tehri-gharwal,"I have visited this Camp Carnival on 31st Dec.-2016 for 2 nights, we were 2 families with kids and booked 3 tents, This property is located at very scenic place and you will get amazing view from here (valley view as well as Himalaya view) we have enjoyed 31st night here with bonfire and DJ, there were almost 100 peoples on 31st night, Camp Owner Mr. Sunil is very helpful and caring person, he has arranged separate bonfire for each groups with veg/ non-veg snacks. The food quality also good, like home made food. not much oily and spicy. we loved this place very much, on 1st January night we experienced a snow fall also. in winter season specially during new year there is heavy cold, you must carry heavy woolens cloths. near by attraction is Surkanda devi Temple, which is",Dharmendra1973,/Profile/Dharmendra1973,"Ghaziabad, India",50

Those who want go for Camping, Bonfire, fun activities etc. Mata Sarkunda Devi Temple is a very popular attraction near Kanatal.",Abhishek A,/Profile/411abhisheka,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"it is no doubt it is good place close to nature but the service provided is pathetic, food Quality is poor, staff member attitude is not tolerable, They don't have sense how to talk with corporate vigilance overall all things is good but i suggest if you going to Kanatal please select some other resort or place for staying.",manish s,/Profile/manishs3025,,10

tehri-gharwal,"Camp Kanatal is located just on the downhill side of the main road. Having set up in a remote area the facility is just basic and is ideal for  one-night stay .  We were riding from Dhanolti to Pipalkoti and stayed there for a night. The night in April was very cold. But the camp had provided bonfire & hot water. The sleep quality was good. Dinner was good however, the breakfast was very disappointing. Virtually there was nothing.",Devadas Vasudevan,/Profile/devadasv,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",30
tehri-gharwal,"â€‹Never visit the Kanatal camp (kanatalcamp.com). You will book their camps hoping to enjoy far way from workplace however the rude staff (Praveen the coordinator) doesn't care about you.  We selected their ""super Deluxe camps"" and found following 'amenities':  1. Used bedsheets 2. Dirty wash-rooms 3. Inadequate water supply 4. Unhygienic food 5. There are no hangers in the camps nor in wash-rooms. This might sound awkward but this is important for everyone 6. Water clogging in wash-rooms 7. No zips in camp and wash-rooms 8. You can feel the water coming into the camp from the wash-rooms  Overall, the service and food is very poor. Few important things to be declared:  1. Dinner will be served till 9 pm and post that kitchen will be closed 2: Bonfire will be for 30-45 minutes",Ankit G,/Profile/AnkitG1209,,10

tehri-gharwal,"They provided just stay and food, no activity at all. Quality of food was very average. Waste of money. Near this camp you hardly find a place to visit.

tehri-gharwal,A quickly planned trip with friends in tbe mid of july. It was raining all the way from delhi to kanatal. The best part was the journey because we could see cloud floatibg around our cars. The kanatal camp is a nice and comfortableplace to stay. Food was very good and we enjoyed the camp fire a lot.,Anuprita B,/Profile/anupritab2016,,40
tehri-gharwal,"You wont find a tourist crowed here. Just have pure air, green trails, peaceful nature and nutritious food. Avoid to visit in rainy season, roads get slippery. Do hangouts, bonfire and recharge your self. As this is a offbeat destination, you will find only few resorts or camp who offer staying or lodging. Neither a rest house or hotel, yeah its good will let you breathe if you want to keep yourself away to the crowed and noise.",banjara_abhi,/Profile/banjara_abhi,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"Went here for an office offsite and don't even know where to start. So I assume if someone takes up 17 tents, it's meant to be good business for the resort but they really didn't care a shoot. Terrible tents. Unwashed, uncleaned, smelly. Terrible toilets with every possible insect in them. Terrible food and terrible service along with an attitude that makes it worse. Don't ever go here.",thearunverma,/Profile/thearunverma,"Noida, India",10

tehri-gharwal,"Camp kanatal is an amazing place to stay if you want to get some peace out of the city. The tents have attached washrooms which are well maintained, there are bonfire nights and the food is gratifying.The staff is very hospitable and the activities are also good. Above all, with such a reasonable price, we were expecting some flaws in the camp but surprisingly it turned out to be awesome.",tj1228,/Profile/tj1228,,40
tehri-gharwal,"Visited kanatal last week (May 2015) and enjoyed a lot!! After going through details of a lots of other camps, we chose The kanatal camp wing1 for our trip.  The camps in dhanualti and other places may seem fancy but this camp is no doubt one of the best i have seen !  We went to the camp in slight off season and we(a group of 8) were alone in the camp (YESS! NO one else!!!) At first it seemed scary, but gradually we realized we were actually lucky coz all the facilities were availed just by us. The food, the games, the bone fire, all were set according to our needs. It rained throughout the first night but we compensated the next day which was sunny and cool.  Staff were very helpful and were always available on call. They were fun to talk to and had a good sense of humor and",ArunavG,/Profile/ArunavG,"New Delhi, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"I visited Kanatal, with family and friends,in August 2014 and really liked this place. The Camp Kanatal is situated on a road-side hill. Its a quite, serene and near-nature place.  The Swiss Tents for accommodation are very decent and have fairly good toilets (for a camp site). We stayed there for three days, and it rained throughout the first night. But still we had no issues with the tents. I think, it was a wonderful camping experience. We participated in some adventure activities that they organized and they also organized a separate bonfire specially for our group.  Staff is quite helpful. They were always available on call. Hot water is provided through buckets, but they don't make you wait much. The nearby jungle treks are a must try.  We also met a local family, nearby,",Desi Wanderers,/Profile/ManavBhardwaj,"New Delhi, India",40

It is very cold place even during summer time. Cost is reasonable for group booking. Good set of activities provided. Overall good place to relax and enjoy with friends.",Ankushgoel1986,/Profile/Ankushgoel1986,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"This is a nice quiet camp near dhanaulti with swiss tents and pretty decent toilets that are attached to individual tents, much better than the dry pits at a lot of rishikesh camps. The overall camp area is not quite big and they will utilize resources of a nearby camp for some of your activities. The food is pretty decent and the service generally prompt. They have a small area designated for bonfire groups but we gave it a slip as it was really cold when we went there just before christmas .. overall, I must say it was a total value for money experience considering that we paid around 1500/person/day for our group (off-season group deal)",mohitsplace,/Profile/mohitsplace,"Mahabaleshwar, India",40
