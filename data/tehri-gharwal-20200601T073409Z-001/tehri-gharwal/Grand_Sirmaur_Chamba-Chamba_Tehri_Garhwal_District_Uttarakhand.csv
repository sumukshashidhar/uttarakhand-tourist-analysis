tehri-gharwal,"Worst hotel, Worst Staff, Cheater. You can’t trust that you will get stay in the hotel even after your confirmed booking. I made a booking of 2 rooms for 4 people online through MakeMyTrip, and when we reached to the hotel then they didn’t allow us for check-in. All the staff members including owner of the hotel were very rude and unprofessional; they even don’t know how to talk with the customers. They all were abusing badly, arguing with us and saying we’ll not give you check-in on any cost. It doesn’t matter to us if you have confirmed booking, we are not going to give you stay here. Then we called on support number of MakeMyTrip for this concern and discussed with them for the resolution. Change of the hotel and location at 8 o’clock in night was not possible for us as",Ashok,/Profile/Ashok3421,,10
tehri-gharwal,"We stayed two nights. The hotel is about a fifteen minute walk from the bus drop off point in the centre of town. We had a large room with a window looking out to the street, ample hot water, and a wonderful marble floor. In fact all the floors and stairs are finished in nicely layed marble, something that often goes unnoticed. We found the owner to be both polite and friendly, and formal in service provision. Our in-room breakfast order was well prepared and prompt. Overall for us a relaxing, if modest, place to stay.",geesee,/Profile/geesee,Australia,30
tehri-gharwal,"I alongwith my family visited this hotel in Chamba Uttarakhand which lies in Tehri Garhwal District and enjoyed my summer vacations.  Everything including Food and accommodation available in the Hotel is impressive and within budget.  There is terrace above third floor which is nice place to enjoy natural beauty of Chamba.  I will recommend it for ample car parking space, courteous staff and supportive management of the hotel.  Surely visit again.  Nearby attractions include Tehri Dam, Surkunda Devi Temple, Kanatal and Dhanaulti.",Narender_Sharma,/Profile/Narender_Sharma,"New Delhi, India",50
