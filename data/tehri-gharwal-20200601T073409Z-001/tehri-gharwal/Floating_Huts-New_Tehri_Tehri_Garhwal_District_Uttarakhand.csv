tehri-gharwal,I had been to this place with my family alongwith my nephew and his wife for two nights. The ambience is extraordinary and a new concept. We also spent a few days in houseboat in Kashmir but this time it is something different. There are altogether twenty such huts floating in the centre of the lake tied together.  The huts are well maintained and can be approached from the main land by a motor launch kept for that purpose. The lake is surrounded by hills with forest cover. The hut is well furnished and well maintained. One can have their meals in the boat itself. The staff are accommodative and look after your needs with a smile. The first sunrays on the lake water is wonderful sight. The huts give one a nice feeling when it moves a bit with the waves.
