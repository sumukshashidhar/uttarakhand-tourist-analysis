tehri-gharwal,"I have stayed in this Hotel, years back and then this turned out to be a great property to stay for a day if you are on your way to Neelkhant, Badrinath etc. The owner used to manage the property him self then, it's currently leased to a few young guys who are only interested in making money. The hotel is now in bad shape with seepage in rooms, loose wc seat covers, missing bathroom fittings, they don't provide you towels till you ask for the same, in spite of me opting for a suite room you don't even get a bottle of water in the room, the mini fridge was switched off and smelling. The omly reasonable things are its location  being next to a petrol Pump which are few in Shiv puri and has full DG backup, important in a place where there are major power cuts.

tehri-gharwal,"  I am an environmentalist. I stayed at Chanakya Resort on 4th june for my project work. This resort surrounded by nature's scenic beauty, situated at the prime location with a lot of parking space and is just 300 meters away from the river Ganga, where River Rafting is done. I also did the River Rafting and enjoyed a lot. The resort's rooms are good, balcony having nature's view. Early morning I enjoyed rising sun from the mountains with Tea in resort's lawn. The food was very delicious and hotel staff is very cooperative. Staff made sure to make available everything we have asked for, that is a very nice spirit. Infact I visited Rishikesh for my research project, I realised that Rishikesh city is too much crowded so I preferred to take a room in an AC hotel at Shivpuri only",sakshigupta,/Profile/sakshigupta,"Jaipur, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"Being a hill station , don't expect much of a comfort . But the management and the staff made sure that you got all you wanted as quick as possible. Hats off to them for all the help rendered out.   The location is far from the city , and you will not find anything to do near the hotel . But that should be looked as an advantage because you get to travel to all the activities area and the journey itself is quite scenic.

Mobile reception is pathetic in that area....you'll end up monkeying around with your mobile to catch the network.  Restaurant : Food was homely..Need something fancy...forget about it in Shivpuri...even Shiva Resort just beside it was just okay...so better stick to this one...  Technically,  (1) if you are there for river rafting and outdoor fun,  (2) with family, elderly and kids, and hence, would like to avoid camping (3) just need a comfortable place (bed) to sleep at night and nice, clean and comfy bathrooms at reasonable price ....this is the place.",PreetiJaiswal,/Profile/PreetiJaiswal,"New Delhi, India",40

Cool breeze flows due to the river 4. Mountains surround the hotel, so the view is pretty 5. Balconies and terrace are very suitable for dining, music and drinks 6. Huge parking lot inside, which is very rare in hotels of hill stations 7. Staff is not very professional but very soft-spoken and helpful 8. Restaurant serves delicious food and provides room service also 9. Laxman Jhoola, Geeta Bhawan & Neergarh Waterfalls are close-by and an unexplored place. Away from the crowd of the city. 10.
