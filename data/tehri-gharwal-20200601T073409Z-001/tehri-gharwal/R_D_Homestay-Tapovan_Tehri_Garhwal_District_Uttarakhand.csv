I only booked to stay for 2 nights as I was moving onto a hotel but I cancelled the hotel within hrs of arriving as I preferred to stay here.   The house: Situated in a quiet laneway in upper Tapovan. A little tricky to find at first so make sure you call Ramesh on arrival in Tapovan so he can direct you. Relaxed & airy with a rooftop for hanging clothes & doing some morning yoga.   The room: is basic but very comfortable with your own bathroom & ceiling fan.
