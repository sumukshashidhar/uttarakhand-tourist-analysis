Situated among the wild forests facing river Ganga, the tents at this place are equipped with nice washrooms and showers. It also has a fabulous poolside and lots of space for children to play. The food is made fresh and served at the restaurant which shuts down by 11 at night. There is no wifi and room service in the tents, but the experience of living in a jungle with wild animals around is too good.

I think snow leopard provided us with exactly what we were looking for. An extremely well prepared team who could deliver on our guided hike expectations. The differences we experienced along the way I think were primarily due to us being different from their usual customers who are proper mountain climbers out for adventure.    Areas to improve: •	Full English speaking tour manager, I don’t know if Vijay was shy or upset but his reluctance to communicate at times was uncomfortable and at others carried inheritant risk •	More experienced guide, Ketan offered value when he sort fit, his knowledge was also biased in based in a certain way world view.",Rhys25,/Profile/Rhys25,"Melbourne, Australia",40

We went rafting and were greeted back on the shores with warm soup, snacks and towels by the hotel. Being on the banks of the Ganga was really a treat!",Evolvin,/Profile/Evolvin,"New Delhi, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"I was at the camp with four friends in the last week of May. It was hot and sultry but we were insisting a lot to stay on the beach and not on the camp. I would say camp panther should be applauded for their candid feedback and their clear recommendations. We stayed at the camp panther site (not on the beach) and in retrospect it was the best thing to do.  As soon as we arrived, we experienced the best ever customer service in terms of welcoming us, taking care of our comfort and helping us in every small need and ensuring comfort for the next 24 hours all through day and night. The tents provided are very clean, neat and hygienic. We also engaged our selves in two rafting sessions and I would vouch for the team's experience and rafters were extremely patient, professional and",Anukool J,/Profile/anukoolj,,50
tehri-gharwal,"Superb! I really can't recommend this place highly enough. The camp has been sensitively developed to provide a great sense of luxury with 'back to nature' feel.  The staff are highly trained, friendly, warm and fun. Whether you're there for a company retreat or a more personal getaway, everyone is made very welcome.  Of all the benefits, perhaps the greatest is the scope to ride the rapids and ganga white water with the best trained experts on the river.. These people are clearly very diligent about their training and know their stuff. When you see how sloppy many of the other river guides are, it makes you appreciate the Camp Panther professionalism even more.  I've been three times and will certainly be going again, just as soon as I can.",MARK P,/Profile/Q6639UKmarkp,"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",50
tehri-gharwal,"I went with my company for a team retreat for the second time ... this place remains a peaceful oasis of luxury, staffed by people who truly care about every little detail - service and safety - to ensure that the experience is truly memorable. The campus is idyllic, the food excellent and all freshly cooked on site and the huts/tents are maintained immaculately. If you want a base from which to do white water rafting, visit a white sand beach next to Ma Ganga and a truly ""wow"" zip-line high across the river and back - this is the place for you.",Graham W,/Profile/grahamw720,Europe,50
tehri-gharwal,Camp Panther is an ideal place for those who love to go in the lap of nature. However they don't want to compromise on quality and hygiene. Camp Panther has a very active and supportive staff. We found the camps very comfortable and with a lot of privacy. The place is full of adventure activities. They even have their own rock wall to scale if you don't want to go out. The surprise Dinner arrangement on the panther beach one night was a great experience. Food quality can be improved a bit with the kind of money they charge. They should invest in good food.,Alok V,/Profile/Flashwanderer,"Ghaziabad, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"I took my entire office of about 50 people and we stayed at Camp for 3 nights .. Everything that one can think is impeccable.  Foods brilliant, cleanliness, courteous staff, tents are wonderfully managed, well trained professionals who assist you with activities like rafting and zipping.     zipping line at the camp is a must try. The view of the zip line is amazing and worthy of each heart beat that you miss before you experience it!   talking about food, it is wonderful.  one would not miss home while being here!   the beach camp is beautifully made.. the beach is clean and very accessible with support staff always on a vigil.  a step into the water and you will see safety kayaks all around you..

tehri-gharwal,The place is located in Shivpuri which is a hotbed for river rafting. I stayed here for 3 nights and the experience was really amazing. The tents are pretty comfortable for the stay. Good facilities for doing outbound activities and the staff is pretty well trained and courteous. Food is simply amazing with a wonderful ambience for dining. Highly recommended location for weekend getaways as well as a stopover if you are travelling to the higher himalayas from rishikesh.  A must visit if you happen to be around rishikesh.,Umesh3470,/Profile/Umesh3470,"Mumbai, India",50
tehri-gharwal,"This is a great weekend getaway from Delhi, for anyone desiring an experience in the mountains and an exotic swim in the Ganga. The staff was very hospitable and I felt I had built personal relationships with each and every one of them.   Staff Support: Kamal was very attentive to our needs, and provided his opportune presence and support at all times.  We felt we had the flexibility to work around with the schedules and this helped us getting the much needed rest. Food: Enjoyed the meals that were prepared for us.  At one point we felt overfed. Activities: Safety was the main mantra before all activities and I appreciated it very much.  Sanju taught me on the kayak with a very patient teaching spirit.  He got me to exceed my expectations on the Kayak. I would surely visit",RudyP25,/Profile/RudyP25,Hyderabad,40
tehri-gharwal,"I went to Rishikesh with 3  friends of mine in the month of March. We reached early morning and the entire staff was waiting for us the Main Gate. and gave us Garlands, which made us feel great. the tents were clean with attached bathroom. the staff was really helpful. We stayed there for 3 days. and the activities (rafting, kayaking, wall climbing, cliff jumping) were great. Our instructor was really helpful and knowledgeable. the day we arrived, it was spent on the river bank, swimming and just lazing around. But the nightmare for us was the second day, when we were not allowed to go on the river bank because there were some Americans staying in the tents there. They gave all the silly reasons to us. We spoke with the manager and after much persuasion he allowed us to stay",Happyhopeindia,/Profile/Happyhopeindia,India,40
tehri-gharwal,a brilliant place to spend a couple of days while you enjoy the white water rafting in rishikesh and a jungle safari in the nearby national park. a trek and an awesome beach volleyball intrigues you further for a wonderful getaway and a stress buster from office.,pranavbajaj,/Profile/pranavbajaj,New Delhi,40
tehri-gharwal,"We went to Camp Panther in April 2010. The weather was getting warm, around 30 degrees in the afternoons, evenings were pleasant. The camp is a nice all inclusive kind of deal, with meals, rafting, other adventure activites all taken care of. The safety standards employed especially with young children was impressive. Rafting, kayaking, rock climbing was really well handled. Food served is mostly Indian, good and tasty. Liked the policy of the camp, to let people carry their own booze, keeps one large expense out for most people. 2 issues - Night activites were bonfire, when it was not cold enough for one. Something else would've been nice. 2nd- the tents were really warm in the afternoons, especially with only fans and poor ventilation",smart_mummy,/Profile/smart_mummy,Gurgaon,40
