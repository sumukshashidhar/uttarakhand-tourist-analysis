tehri-gharwal,I went to Himalayan eco lodges with my friends this july. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. Neither they have clean water in shower nor they have mosquito repellent. They dont even have proper cooling facilities. I want to give two stars because only for their good quality food but still gave one. Services are worst. If you want to drink mineral water you have to go and buy it from market as they will simply say no to you. And if you exceed time from check out even by a minute the will cut off the electricity again and again and when you call them to complaint about that electricity will automatically come. So in my experience DONT GO AND STAY IN THE CAR.,thegame,/Profile/anujkhandelwal71,,10

tehri-gharwal,We booked a standard tent accommodation for one night before taking off for Gaurikund and the Kedarnath yatra ahead. The washroom (detached from the room) had a huge spider which was pretty scary. The sound of the river beside the place was calming. There was no room service and the way from the tent till the restaurant was pretty long. The food was good and so was the service. The staff is polite.

The location is absolutely stunning with the river visible just from outside the tent cottage. Although what separates this campsite from all the others is the food. They've got a decent spread and every dish was properly cooked and tasted great.   About the hospitality/service, it was on point. Every staff member was polite and took great care of us with always wearing a smile. A big shout out to Mahavir ji and his young chaps Akash, Jigender and all the others.

tehri-gharwal,This place has tents for stay. Tents are clean and well maintained. Must visit place for river rafting over river Alaknanda. It offers rafting for 22 km up to Devprayag. Rafting on rapids as well as calm waters of Alaknanda amid tall mountains covered by dense forest is once in a lifetime experience. If one wants to see real beauty of mother Ganga then he has to do this rafting. You feel as if mother Ganga is playing with her kids. Best part of rafting here is that your's is the only raft in the visualized field with very quite surrounding. So you get the real feel of wilderness. In other places it is too crowded. Really amazing experience. For best experience visit this place in off season like Feb-Mar. In summer it may be crowdy.,Parth P,/Profile/parthp200,,50
