Mr shobha ram and the staff made sure we were comfortable and took us personally on a short trek.   The food was fantastic, very homely and fresh. Chai was served anytime we asked for it.

I must say, the staff was very cordial and accepting. We were the only couple on that weekend, even then they provided the service which is certainly appreciated.

tehri-gharwal,"We stayed 1 night at this camp.  Few importance points: This place is little off the main road. So I agree with Hem Joshi that the approach road to the camp site is a little broken. But we are not here for a smooth ride. So it adds up to the adventure feel.  Second, the camps are a on a higher ground from the road. So you have to take a small but steep walk up, maybe around 300 mtrs. Again, no complains. The camp quality and washrooms were very neat and clean. Food was basic but very tasty. They serve snacks during evenings which was tasty. The best food during our stay in Uttranchal. These guys arrange bon-fire during the night after dinner. Again very refreshing.

The road to retreat has collapsed and one has to walk up a fair distance from main road. There is a shortage of heaters and also since there is no running hot water , one has to keep coaxing the staff to get their bucket of hot water which is in premium.

tehri-gharwal,"We were looking for some camping options in Kanatal for our quick break during Good Friday long weekend and with few online searches and trip adviser reviews, shortlisted Whispering pines. As compared to other camping sites nearby, this was relatively expensive and we booked it with assumptions that we will get better experience.  First hurdle was to locate the property, there are no mobile signals (except BSNL). This camp site is located around 1 KM off the road, there was a sign board at main road but no sign board close to propertly. Moreover the small narrow road leading to camp was fully damaged due to some road widening project.

But where this place looses it all is the poor level of maintenance and hygiene. Agreed that camping is never going to be as clean as a hotel...but the dining room, the plates, cutlery, the bed linen, the pillows don't have to be less clean than a good hotel.... It appears that the management in Delhi has left it all in the hands of the camp management and are probably not taking keen interest in these matters...or may be this is all addressed only when the corporate clients check",keyur vadodaria,/Profile/keyurv,"London, United Kingdom",30

It was both surprising to realise that there is no regular water supply here and we were told that water comes in tankers from some fifty kms away!! The amazing part however was that we did not feel the scarcity at all due the very competent handling of logistics by Mr. Chauhan and his team.

Minor negatives are that there is a shortage of water but it is the problem every where in these hills and not unique to this property. However, the staff ensured that we never faced any acute problem due to the shortage.

The food is delicious and the whole staff is pretty courteous (special mention to Mr. Pashupati who is very sweet and helpful).

The Ghiadhar trek shall remain a cherished memory for me forever. Still can’t get over the awesome view of Chaukhamba and other Himalayan peaks. You can’t expect a 5 star service in such a remote area and it is not a luxurious place at all, however this nature resort does complete justice to the exotic location. Activities including trek, hiking, bonfire were awesome and very well managed by the team. A really great place to spend a few days with friends.",Sudhir S,/Profile/974sudhirs,,50
tehri-gharwal,"We spent a long weekend in this beautiful place. There were two main things which made our trip a memorable one. First, the drive to Jwarna via Dehradun was so adventurous and exiting. To add to that our active holiday experience was simply fantastic. We were so pleasantly surprised by many aspects of our stay at this lovely mountain resort.  A few points that need special mention: 1. The view was amazing. Especially during the sunrise and sunset times - simply breathtaking. 2. The location was perfect in more ways than one and because you are lucky to stay away from the noise, the incessant traffic, commercialized hill stations and crowds, which is what we prefer to do.  3. The food quality and the taste was extremely good.  4. Our stay was also enhanced by the service levels",ashufbd,/Profile/ashufbd,ashufbd,50

Both of us are avid photographers and we can tell with confidence that the nature resort and the surrounding areas reward amateur as well as pro photographers handsomely with amazing frames to capture.

The property is a couple of kilometers off the main road. This stretch is a dirt road and quite bumpy, that said it only takes 5-7 minutes hence not much of a problem. The closest town is quite far, so once you ration up for the evening, there wont be anything going or coming, so stock up well in advance.  There are 6 Deluxe tents (basically means you have your own bathroom) and other normal tents (with shared toilets). We stayed in the deluxe tent. The tent was...well a tent.
