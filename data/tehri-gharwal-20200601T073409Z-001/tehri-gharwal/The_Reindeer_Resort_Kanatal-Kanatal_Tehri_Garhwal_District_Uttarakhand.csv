tehri-gharwal,"A lovely hotel, simple sober, u get clean air but the rooms are not cleaned every day, we had to ask for them to clean it. The bed sheets were still not changed.  Hot water was in the room but only worked when electricity was there else you are on God's goodwill. Television set there but no surity of any cable channel coming clearly.  I would stay here only for the view that you get on the second floor of the hotel - There is almost no room service, as they were running a full house so there was no staff. All the staff was either cooking or cleaning the dinning room.   Since this is a hotel in the middle of nowhere you would ned up having all your meals in the Hotel itself. North Indian food is what they make. Simple homely food but they do not plan any meal so if you order Dal,",PG3112,/Profile/PG3112,"New Delhi, India",20
tehri-gharwal,"We reached the hotel quite late in the night.. in the middle of rains and potential landslides.. the hotel is comfortable and cozy. Rooms are basic but warm, restaurant food is limited in spread but tastes good. Front balcony offer spectacular views of the valley. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Good choice.",Kritika1307,/Profile/Kritika1307,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
tehri-gharwal,"Cozy and comfortable budget resort in Kanatal. No frills, except a spectacular view of the valley in front and a beautiful sunrise. Resort restaurant is basic but serves good food. Rooms are neat and clean and offer the comfort you need for a good night's sleep. Staff is cooperative and friendly. Good hotel for the price.",Katytandon1307,/Profile/Katytandon1307,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
