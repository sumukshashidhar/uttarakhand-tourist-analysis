tehri-gharwal,"My stay with family at adventurebaaz resort was a memorable one . The location of the property is simply amazing,on roads right in the heart of nature. That is perfect for people who just want to spend some time in quiet.  The Cottages and tents are standalone  rooms with attached toilets with geyser and tents are not with geyser. The food is cooked in house, fresh every time. They feed you till your throat and the quality is out standing. You can order any specific item you want to eat and it will be made as required. In all, excellent property with equally good staff.",Karan Singh,/Profile/kk_singh05,,50

tehri-gharwal,"Excellent location for a secluded private vacation. About 3 km from main Dhanaulti Town. Having own vehicle is better. View from the rooms is awesome. The room has glass panels instead of walls for a fantastic view. I stayed in semi deluxe cottage which is below the deluxe cottage. Deluxe cottages have private balconies whereas semi deluxe have shared balconies. But nonetheless, the view from the property is awesome. Staff is helpful and food is decent.",Vinod Kumar,/Profile/vkmamgain,"New Delhi, India",50
