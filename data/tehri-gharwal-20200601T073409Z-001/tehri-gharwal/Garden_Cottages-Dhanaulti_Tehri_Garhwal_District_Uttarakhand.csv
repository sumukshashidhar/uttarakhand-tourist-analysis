tehri-gharwal,"hotel is little off the village(dhanaulti), but is on good location with ample parking space. 2 Rooms on the base with quad sharing are pretty nice. Weather is awesome during monsoons however please note the roads from rishikesh via Narendra nagar is in under construction so its good to come via Mussoorie. room service is little delayed but food quality was good.  PS: we did our own barbeque and they did not object üòÅ",Amarpreet_Saggu,/Profile/Amarpreet_Saggu,"Noida, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"Amazing olace to explore. We ended here by chance as we could not het any hotels in mussorie. But thank god we came here as it just made our trip happening. Nothing left in mussorie. This place is a must. Garden cottage provides amazing valley view and they will arrange everything of your choice which includes bonfire and dishes which is not even in their menu, As they have limited menu.",dhruv699,/Profile/dhruv699,"New Delhi, India",40
tehri-gharwal,"They sell themselves as premium, but the truth is far from it. It's season time and the time to make money, we understand that. The only thing about season is GREED writ large on their faces.  The owner is missing. THere is a lowly chap at the reception. HIs authority to deliver, extract maximum money from the customer, deliver as little as possible.  THere is no rate. THey see you, your car and the availibility of room and spot fix it.  The facilities mentioned on all the travel websites are a sham.  Wi-if is available only at the reception which is three levels above the rooms.   Instead of clean soft cotton bedsheets, the rooms have cheap printed ones. First look make you wonder whether they were changed after the last guest left.  The crockery is plastic and greasy.

tehri-gharwal,This place is run by very nice couple who has their son in New Zealand and have done a good job in developing a beautiful landscape at this place. The rooms and big and clean and has a beautiful vegetation and flora done up. Situated in perfect location not too far and too close to over crowded place. one can easily walk down to mall road and JP Hotel. But yes its a little more than a distance for those who are not fit.  Breakfast is home cooked and is super. One can easily order food and enjoy! Loved this place and specially the location which has serene surrounding and ample of car parking.,Jaikhande,/Profile/Jaikhande,"New Delhi, India",50

tehri-gharwal,"I generally prefer to go for home stays, when I travel solo but this time I was travelling with my family. So while searching for hotels in Dhanaulti, a friend (whose native place is nearby) recommended me this place.  To start with,the hotel is situated approx 1 km from the main town ( which is the way I like,to stay away from the crowd n noise). This place is exactly on the lap of nature( I was mind blown as my first impression) .We have booked three deluxe cottages ,which had wooden flooring and was facing the mountains( by the look of it,I think almost every other rooms in this hotel have a spectacular view). The good part there is a lot of trekking options nearby ( ryt from the doorsteps). I will be attaching some pics I have taken. The food was finger licking good (We",Koushik85,/Profile/Koushik85,Noida,50
