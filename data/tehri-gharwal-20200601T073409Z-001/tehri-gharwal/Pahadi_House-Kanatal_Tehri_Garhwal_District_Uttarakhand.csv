tehri-gharwal,"A beautiful little place called ranichauri nestled between chamba and masoorie,A place where you find your inner self. This place is a must for anyone travelling up to the lower himalayas in uttaranchal. A yoga retreat where you just need to see the snow capped mountains and heal your self.Thnks Mr Abhay Sharma for this lovely experience and am hating my self for living there just for 3 days...  The life of a village is something I wanted to show my boys and it turned out way more than that... The two little puppies taught my boys some real compassion. I discovered the other soft side to my boys when they were chilling with the pups. The staff was like a family and felt at home...

The lovely in house dog Monty is a darling. The kids kept playing with him till he had had enough of it ! Do not expect super luxury but the staff is very sincere in whatever they do. Also, the food is droolingly awesome, ended up earing almost double of what I usually eat on normal days. Reaching there can be tricky.The google maps direction ia a bit messed up. Ask for proper directions from the person coordinating with you for the stay , and you shall reach without problems.

tehri-gharwal,"As we drove through the hills covered with deodaar trees, I had an amazing feeling within. It was 6 o'clock in the evening and the sun had just begun to settle behind the mountains covered by the snow white clouds...   I stopped on my way to click some picture perfect memories !!  The scenic beauty on the way made me and my friends all the more excited about what lays ahead !! :)  We had to trek for a few metres before we entered Mainland of Kanatal- Pahadi House.  Peace, tranquility, fresh air, with a perfect blend of flora and fauna. Woahh !! What more could I expect from a place so far off from the hustle bustle of metropolitans.    2 days are gone by... I am leaving the lap of the nature to go back to work in Delhi... But this time I carry mental peace and most",Divas_Gupta,/Profile/Divas_Gupta,"Dehradun, India",50

tehri-gharwal,"On the road from Chamba to Mussoorie, 15 mins before you reach what one may consider Kanataal Market (a few random shops), is nestled a simple yet picturesque cluster of dwellings. We had a small stop of three days over here on our way to Mussoorie. This place is ideally suited to rejuvenate one‚Äôs mind and body. Surrounded by mountains and valleys, there are no busy markets or crowded mall roads to distract you. Instead you can relax in front of the house gazing across a superb view of the valley or stroll through the numerous trails that intertwine the area. On a clear day you will catch snow capped peaks high into the Himalayas. A small group of staff (we had four) take care of your every need.

The journey was nice but the real astonishing part was this place where we decided to stay, 'Pahadi House, Kanatal'.  Oh dear !! Oh dear !! What an amazing view it was..!! My heart almost skipped a beat when I first saw it. Peaks so close, you just wish you could touch it. Air so pure and fresh, your lungs don't wanna leave a single bit of it, they just wanna grasp all at once. View so clear, you'd feel like there's an HD camera in your retina. Everything was just mesmerizing.  The hospitality was also quite spectacular. The guys there, Vikram and Kalyan treated us like brothers.
