tehri-gharwal,"Visited this place with family. Had a very bad experience. Torn bedding, dirty broken furniture, dirty washrooms, and poor service. Spiders in room. Also there were spider webs in room. Only breakfast was OK, nothing else was OK. Not recommended at all..",Ankit A,/Profile/953ankita,"Frankfurt, Germany",10
