tehri-gharwal,I had a firm booking and kept in contact regarding my arrival time early morning rather than the night before. Upon arrival I discovered they had given my room away and shunted me off to an inferior hotel at higher cost.,Inge D,/Profile/asianomad88,traveller,10
tehri-gharwal,Stayed here for 6 nights whilst exploring Rishiskesh. This perfectly nice hostel was cheap and clean. The staff were relaxed helpful and accommodating. We went for very early morning yoga sessions and there were very kind about opening up letting us out at 5:30am (the doors are locked at night and it is very  secure) Great location and had a (what appeared to be an unused) great top floor which over looks the Ganges. Say up there with other guests watching Diwali fireworks and it was wonderful.    Definitely recommend for budget travellers. There is definitely room for improvement in the hostel but so far so good :) ,Nandi87,/Profile/Nandi87,"London, United Kingdom",50
tehri-gharwal,"Raahi is newly opened with hands-on owners who take turns looking after the hostel. Location is central in Tapovan / Laxman Jhula area. Dorm room has 3 bunk beds with an ensuite. Wifi is reliable. Great place for meeting people. Ideally for solo travelers. Open roof deck - great view of Ganga River in the daytime and great meditation place at night. They have a yoga area with blocks and mats for anyone to deepen their practice. A/c is not reliable due to voltage fluctuation, but it's a Rishikesh issue - not the hostel. Rate is the lowest I found in Agoda so for value, it's bang for the buck. Highly recommended!",Gigit S,/Profile/CoconutInsider,Asia,50
tehri-gharwal,"I stayed in Raahi for about a week in the shared dorm, the accommodation was very good, spacious and clean. And the best part was the crew of the hostel which were very kind and very helpful, they helped me rent a scooter, and reserve train ticket at the cheapest price I found and they let me store my luggage for 3 days free when I went to Chopta trek away from Rishikesh. Great place, very recommended! ",Roee Y,/Profile/r0eey,,50
tehri-gharwal,"The Hostel just opened a few months ago and they have a lot of projects going on! So in the future it will be even better! clean rooms and hot shower. The location is great and the rooftop has a beautiful view for sunrise and sunset! And Kaustubh, the owner, is the best! As soon as I arrived he make me feel like home and he also showed me around Rishikesh, can't be more grateful for all his help and company. Wish you all the best in this project!",Conipicero,/Profile/Conipicero,"Santiago Metropolitan Region, Chile",50
