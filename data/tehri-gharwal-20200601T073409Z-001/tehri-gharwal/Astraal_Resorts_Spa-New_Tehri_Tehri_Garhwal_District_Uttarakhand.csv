One has to climb down some steps to reach the rooms and hence not advisable for elderly people. Rooms are spacious, clean and neat. Need some upkeep though, as the toilet door in my room had to be pressed very hard to be locked. There was gap between the main door bottom and the room floor, big enough for a rat or snake to come in.  This is a real possibility considering the shrubs and lawns around. Heater in my room was not working as well, but they gave me access to toilet in other room, which was vacant fortunately, served my purpose. Location is beautiful, really amidst nature.

tehri-gharwal,"We were 2 couples along woth a 3 yrs old kid travelling from Noida. It took us around 7 hrs along with 1 hr break by our own car.  The best part about the trip was the Roads, the weather, the view, homely food and the service with a personal touch.  I likes this place a lot and will plan a second visit with a bigger gang and for a linger duration (may b 3 days). I would like to cover the water sports available nearby.  Few things that can be improved upon are immediate starting of the spa and some additional care for basic things like washrooms and dripping sheds at few places.  But my everall experience was wonderful and I will be back... possibly when there will b snow all around.",Vikash P,/Profile/VikashP150,,50
tehri-gharwal,"We were a group of 5 along with a 6 month old baby, went to this place after deliberating hard on various options for a 2N, 3D excursion away from office.   I must share that this place turned to be a heaven for all of us. We had such a wonderful time that it would not be easy to explain the feelings in writing.  To begin with... Astraal spa Resort is a wonderful property located at a beautiful location which fills you with thrill. The property is in Phakot, a couple of hours drive from Rishikesh.    The Cottages  are big, clean  with decent space inside to offer a comfortable stay. The layout of cottages around property is good.  Staff is extremely polite and very attentive to the needs of guest. The best part was food and Hospitality.

There motive is to make fool of the customers and grabbing money. But not focus on the services to be offered. So not recommend any one to go there and make fool of them selves.
