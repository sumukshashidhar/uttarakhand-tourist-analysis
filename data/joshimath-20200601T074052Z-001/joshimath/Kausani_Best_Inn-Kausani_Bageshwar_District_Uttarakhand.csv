joshimath,"Well this is one of the extremely RARE instances where a TripAdvisor rating (Of # 01) failed to get me into a good place.   Based on the photos of the property available online and the high ranking I booked a THREE-night stay at this property.   A long nine-hour journey got us there in the evening but sadly it turned out to be a big disappointment. To start with a big group was occupying the rest of the rooms at this small property. And unfortunately, they had ZERO civic sense. They were very loud and their children were out of control. The whole Hotel felt like a TAMASHA.   The hotel is managed and run by a group of young amateurs and there is no senior management at this property.

joshimath,"Kausani is best known for its panoramic view of the great Himalayan peaks spread across India to Nepal. The best place to witness this truth is Kausani Best Inn. There are many ""BEST""s hidden in this name. The best thing to do at this place is doing nothing, and simply experiencing the beauty of nature. The location is perfect as it is bit far from the hustle and bustle of the town center. You will always be accompanied by the cacophony of the chirping birds and chorus of the passing by winds through the pines and oaks. You just have to choose your place, pull the chair, sit back comfortably and enjoy the entire view from valley to top of the peaks in one frame.

joshimath,"Picking ""Best Inn"" to stay at Kausani was one of my best decisions.  First of all, the hotel's architecture is incredibly admirable. If u get to stay on the first floor of the main building, as I did, u would love the skylit wooden roof.  Secondly, the location: The hotel has the greatest view, and from every bedroom one could see the snow-clapped Himalayan range. Just imagine urself waking up in the morning to see the sparkling white Nanda Devi peaks from ur bed wrapped up in warm blankets -- ""it's unadulterated heaven"". Third, the food and hotel staff. They are the warmest people, vivacious, extremely friendly, will make u feel at home, and at the same time thorough professionals. Do I need to say more?

joshimath,"Undoubtedly is the best place to stay in Kausani I believe. Only because of the reason that it has the best view of the Himalayan range. Staffs are well behaved and friendly. Service is good and depends on the hotel's crowd. It becomes slower if the guests increased. Parking of vehicles will be outside and on the hotel adjacent roads, although not a concern as per my reading. Only drawback is the food here. We didn't like any of them they offered during our stay there for two days. However, I would still recommend this because Kausani is a place to feel Himalaya and to breathe it every time...and Kausani best inn is the best one to make you do so!!!",Abhishek_Chakrabarti,/Profile/Abhishek_Chakrabarti,"Calcutta, West Bengal, India",40

Best time to visit Kausani is after rainy season i.e October Noverber....My suggestion to Mr Negi to have some extra curricular activities and sports should be there in the resort. Some play area for the children having swings and games will add another feather to",kheraman,/Profile/kheraman,New Delhi,40

joshimath,We stayed in this hotel in May-2012. A nice peaceful hotel. It is a small 8 rooms hotel but having very nice staff. Mr. Ravindra Negi is very co-operative and he has extended very warm support to us during our stay and journey.,pallavanjaria,/Profile/pallavanjaria,Vadodara,40
joshimath,"We stayed there for 2N/3D. It was a very average stay as we were travelling in December which, as told by the hotel Manager Mr. Negi, is an off season for Kausani. They had arranged for a taxi (charged) which brought us to Kausani Best Inn. We had booked our room on the first floor, which was supposed to be from the better lot. The room had small windows on the top which could not be closed and hence made it very chilly during the winters. The manager explained that these rooms were specially designed for the summers, which is their main business season (this was not told to us while we were making our bookings) and that, this was their first experience in the winters hence there's nothing that they can do about the windows. So we had to move to the ground floor (But we were",NVJ_12,/Profile/NVJ_12,"Mumbai, India",30

joshimath,"We were a party of 7 people including 3 teenagers and had the best experience starting from our arrival at Ram Nagar, where the Manager of Best Inn arranged to have us picked up in a new Xylo and get us comfortably to Kausani.  Though we did not go out much, even being in the room was a joy and I wud say, there is no way anyone should miss staying in this place. The food is awesome, service is super courteous. In all ways a SUPER 7 STAR EXPERIENCE.  Sorry Negi Saheb, I could not publish this review in time.",Akarshan,/Profile/Akarshan,"Mumbai, India",50
joshimath,"This excellent property is an asset in Kausani. The ambiance is simple but fulfilling. There is an aroma of simplicity and care around you carefully created by the well mannered staff of the hotel. With the great Himalaya standing bright from one horizon to the other and the morning to evening with clear view from your restaurant and in bed you may not find a better view in kausani. Over and above the best place to relax. Have a walk through the pine forest, relax in the lawn or sit in your window you may not find any sound except the birds singing or wind blowing. Great place and should be kept as it is. 1st floor rooms are with better view and be careful from monkey.",Prabir_Visakh,/Profile/Prabir_Visakh,"Visakhapatnam (Vizag), India",50
joshimath,"A few words on Kausani first - Its a very small town and does not have many activities on offer for tourists. Its primary claim to fame is the fact that Gandhiji stayed here for a few days in a tea-garden owner's private residence (which has since been converted into an ashram) and penned down his thoughts in his book called Anasakti Yoga. The ashram offers excellent views of the Himalayas on a clear day and particularly at sunrise, when the mountains take on a golden hue.  There are also a few tea estates nearby where you can take a tour of their factories and taste different varieties of fresh brewed tea. Apart from these, Kausani is primarily a place to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life and relax in the fresh mountain air.

A holiday in Kausani is for the people who look forward to a calm and peaceful stay. The location of the hotel is exotic - you get a very good view of the Himalayan range from all the 8 hotel rooms. The food is tasty (personally we liked the fried chicken very much). The Manager Shri Negi was very hospitable, so was Anil and the room boys Devender and Mukesh. A highly memorable stay.

joshimath,"Dear fellow travelers, always read reviews before deciding where to stay. Luxury & Star rated hotels are not necessarily the best options. The Best Inn, aptly named, was an experience that has left an indelible impression, and not only will i visit again and again, but will highly recommend it to family, friends & acquaintances.

The hotel has a view of the himalayas that is hard to beat and was better than the hotels around as there were no trees that spoilt the view. The rooms at the top are the best but if you have problem climbing stairs then there are rooms at the ground floor too where you get a whole view when u sit outside the rooms.  Our room was at the top floor and they have a sit out right outside your room where u can relax and even have your meals. The room was spacious, airy,neat and well maintained. They had a geyser for hot water so hot water is at your disposal at all times. The staff of the hotel plus the manager, Mr. negi",piyushsushil,/Profile/piyushsushil,"Hyderabad, India",50

When requested, the manager of the hotel arranged a candle light dinner for us and also got us a bunch of flowers from the garden which made us feel special. He was even ready to get us a cake to celebrate our wedding anniversary. each and every staff at the hotel had a smile on his face and greeted us like celebrities.  food is great and they make you dishes according to your inputs.

I had seen the photos on the website before booking the place, but I can tell you the place is atleast 10 times better than how it has been showcased. The view is superb. The people including the owner, manager and the service team are really brilliant and very courteous. We were looked after by a gentleman named Ganesh. He was exceptional in delivering all requests keeping in mind I was travelling with my 3 year old son who had his own demands. Lovely place and people and trust me not too expensive as well.

The rooms are neat and clean, and the bathroom is huge as compared to other resorts in hillstations. The service is prompt, but the food could have been better.
