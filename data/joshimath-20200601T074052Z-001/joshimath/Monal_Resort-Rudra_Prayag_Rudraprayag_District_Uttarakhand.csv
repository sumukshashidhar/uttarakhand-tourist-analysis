joshimath,I wud rate it 3.5 stars... I with my sis and mom stayed at dis hotel fro just one night... I was kind of a layover/stop over on our way to binsar from kanatal... The hotel is huge with a lot of rooms... but there were hardly any guests (there was just another couple).. There are not much options to stay at rudraprayag/karnaprayag...  other than views there is nothing much at the hotel.. for a one night stay for 3 adults i was charged 8k(including dinner and bf) ..since there were not much guests there was no buffet at dinner as well as bf.. we ordered and had in room dining...The view of the alaknanda flowing and the bank is all to urself (u vl have to climb down a  50 steps and u feel like it is a private river bank .. with no tourists)..  other than the alaknanda river bank,rmarkar,/Profile/rmarkar,"Thane, India",30

joshimath,I normally don’t give bad reviews to a hotel But this can rate as one of the worst hotels have stayed. We were a group of 35 Who arrived late had dinner breakfast lunch and were checking out. I think they were relying on the fact we were tired some of the bedlinen was not changed and nor was the bathroom cleaned. When we called reception nobody picked up the phone I was so exhausted we just slept staffwereexpecting another group of foreigners the next day and they knew the rooms were all not cleaned some had the Energy to get the rooms cleaned we just didn’t.

We had booked 2 rooms and both were dirty and bathrooms too. There were no charging points for mobiles. The bed was broken in one of the rooms. The bathroom towels were not clean also.  We informed the front desk about room being unclean and broken bed. They were indifferent and this was the most annoying part. This implies that they don’t care as there are limited options to stay in Rudraprayag.   The food was average but hygiene was lacking. We had to pass the back side of kitchen to reach our rooms. The area outside kitchen was filthy.  I would avoid staying here again and would not recommend it to anyone.,MumbaiKss,/Profile/MumbaiKss,"Mumbai, India",20

We wanted to reduce it by one night as we learned that Guptkashi is more convenient location due to rush season. However, the manager at hotel was simply not willing to make that change and was actually quite rude about the whole thing which left a very bad taste in our mouth before showing up there. (We did incur extra cost to stay one night at Guptkashi - which was the right decision)   Property itself was not too bad...food was 3 out of 5.
