joshimath1,"We stayed for just a night here but the staff pampered us. Within minutes local cuisine was arranged for us and to keep us warm they treated us with camp fire.  In the morning we were treated with a sumptuous breakfast. And when we thought we were done with their hospitality, manager Brijesh along with Mohit Rawat went beyond their call of duty. Since it was a Sunday and due to some strike all the ATMs were shut and we needed cash for the ropeway, they went out of their way to arrange cash for us. Special mention just for their staff who make the trip memorable.",Laxmi Negi,/Profile/Laxminegikarkera,,50

Furthermore the hotel provided us hot honey lemon ginger  tea *on* *the* *house* (welcome tea), as we had a very long journey and the temperature was dropping. I found it very courteous. Buffet was fully organized and food was very good.  Hospitality : 4/5  In this extreme temperature they were giving best to their guests.  They provide free parking unlike many hotels in Joshimath so no need to worry.   *Best* *part* :: They provide you a common room where facilities like in-room bonfire,indoor games and music were provided.
