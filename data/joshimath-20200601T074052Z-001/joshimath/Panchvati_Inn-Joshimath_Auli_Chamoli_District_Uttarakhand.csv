joshimath1,"It was a great stay at Hotel Panchavati Inn as the hospitality, attitudes of the management and other staff was good. Their guidance to explore the place was really helped us to make the trip remembered forever. In fact, with their suggestions only we visited a village named MALERI, about 64 kms. from the hotel was a lifetime experience. On the way we also have seen a Hot Spring whose water is really hot and definitely better than many other such springs we saw at different parts of the country. We will suggest others, if their time permits, to visit this place once beside AULI by ropeway. Regarding hotel room our suggestions are to provide a cupboard in place of big one seater Sofa. Rooms are although small but cosy, with provision of a tower heater.",Neilo61,/Profile/Neilo61,,40

joshimath1,"We stopped here enroute to our trip to VoF both while going towards Ghangriya and returning from it. The room they offered us was great, with a balcony and view of the mountains from the room was simply awesome. The staff are very friendly and they took great care of us. The food was homely but quite tasty. It's also very easily accessible from the market being located barely 10 metres from the stairs at Joshimath. Highly recommended if you want to stay close to the market and bus stand but without the din and bustle, the views are an added bonus.  Tip: Ask for the front rooms as they have the best view.",Dhiresh Daga,/Profile/DhireshD,"Malda, India",50
joshimath1,"It was a very nice room though not a very luxurious one, but the beautiful view of the mighty mountains right from your bed will be awestruck. Great hospitality and very helpful people.   A good place to stay.",Rashmi K,/Profile/RashmiK351,,40
joshimath1,"A simple hotel but price is quite high. The rooms are not spacious enough for three people. Only can accommodate 2 people and if for 3 people there is a sofa chair which is convertible into a bed. An adult will have  difficulty sleeping on it due to its size. Stayed at this hotel ( 3 of us ), the given room had double bed and a sofa chair and we were charged extra for the extra bed which is a sofa chair that is in the room itself. There wasn't hot water in the bathroom and according to the management staff its due to summer but actually June is not summer month. The bathroom is also clogged and the staff should look into these few problems.",jazzwantgill,/Profile/jazzwantgill,"Ipoh, Malaysia",30

joshimath1,"Panchvati Inn, near the Joshimath Post Office, faces the Sleeping Beauty and Elephant Peaks of the mighty Himalayas. Thus the view from the roof on a clear sunny morning is exceptional. The staff of the hotel is friendly, but the food is nothing extraordinary. The rooms are nice and clean, but nothing luxurious. This hotel also allows groups travelling from all over the country or even abroad, for the various treks that Joshimath offers.",Arko_Shine,/Profile/Arko_Shine,"Kolkata, India",30

joshimath1,"I went to Joshimath this Feb. I really needed a break from my business. I saw this hotel(Panchvati) and decided to stay there for a while. I went there for 10 days but stayed for 35 days and shot my film as well. There is something blissful about the hotel. The owner Prabhakar is an amazing guy. Food is delicious. Staffs are well behaved. You can find taxi services, for sightseeing, nearby only. I highly recommend Panchvati for anyone going to Joshimath or nearby areas.",Saurav K,/Profile/780sauravk,,50
joshimath1,Excellent rooms with friendly staff. The best view. The food is very good. Stay here if you want to rejuvenate and get refreshed.  never bother much about the food in such a remote place but I have say they have a prized chef in their kitchen. Even I dared Continental and it was spot on.,simihoney21,/Profile/simihoney21,"Bangalore District, India",50
