joshimath,After reading positive reviews I had booked online through booking.com a double room. When I reached the place I found a friendly man at the counter. The hotel itself was located atop a bank. One had to climb a steep flight of rickety shaking stairs. It is just Impossible for elderly people to climb the dizzying stairs. It was just not worth the trouble. I had to shift to another hotel paying exorbitant charges. The hotel refused to refund the amount and of course booking.com had not bothered to listen to me. Pl avoid this hotel.,svragh,/Profile/svragh,Bangalore ,20
