joshimath,"We stayed one night in last week of march, probably it is best accommodation at Kausani. The location is just fabulous, it offers complete unobstructed panoramic view of Uttatkhand himalaya due to its location at highest point. Rooms are little small but himalaya view rooms offer fabulous view of entire himalayan range. Rooms are cozy, well maintained with all modern amenities and widow side sitting arrangements to enjoy the panorama. It is very close to Anashakti Ashram. You can enjoy the nature trail from the hotel to a local shib mandir. Overall it is best accommodation at Kousani considering the facilities, accessibility and the panoramic view of Himalaya.

The rooms have a somewhat run-down appearance. Bathrooms are basic and fine. The best part of the hotel is once you open the window curtains. It will transform you and take you into the land of Himalayas. You will be able to see the entire Himalayan range with a 180 deg view and what a sight that was. Just stay in the confines of your cozy room and enjoy the magnificent snow-clad peaks right in front of you.   Food: The restaurant is at the ground floor and somewhat dingy.

We were impressed by the hospitality shown and if some one plans to stay in Kausani then this is the best hotel to stay from view, hospitality as well as value for money perspective.",TGaurav,/Profile/TGaurav,"Mumbai, India",50
joshimath,"We reached Kausani around 2 p m after a 3 hours journey from Chaukari. The staff greeted us very well even at this ungodly hour and made sure we were comfortable. They served us hot tea and biscuits.We received a warm welcome from the staff. When we woke up next morning, the sun rays filtered through the big glass windows which offered a view of the distant snow capped mountains from the room itself. The room was very well appointed with wooden flooring and seating area near the big window - nice to sit at leisure and have a view. We had a great time there and made up our minds to stay in this hotel the next time we visit Kausani.  Stayed in November 2012, travelled with my family.",sakyasankarguha,/Profile/sakyasankarguha,kolkata,50
joshimath,"The best part of this property is its location. The rooms are facing the valley with large windows and you can see the mountain peaks right in front of you!! Its terrace is also a good place to experience the sunrise and sunset.But the staff was a bit let down!!Having read such good things about it on tripadvisor, we expected much more!! They had very indifferent attitude.The food quality was also average.But thankfully it improved for the last 2 days after complaining for first 2 days!! But over all a good experience mainly because of the location of the property and the serenity and bountiful Nature of the place, kausani!!",prakash jotwani,/Profile/prjotwani,"Ahmedabad, India",40
joshimath,"This Hotel stands out due to its very decorous and suave service ! I happen to travel a lot in Uttrakhand, and thus have had experienced staying in quiet a few properties, in different price ranges. But till date Sun n Snow Inn beats them all in visitor friendliness ! The whole staff was very decent and courteous . Specially the senior management was very attentive to our needs and took pains to go into the details to make our stay an enjoyable one . The view is great, the rooms , at least the ones we checked were nice, and the food was fine . There can always be room for improvement, but if they can at least maintain this level, they should easily qualify for a 4/5 rating !!!!",SDM1999,/Profile/SDM1999,"Bangalore District, India",40
joshimath,"The best thing about this place is the location...perched at the top of the hill giving you the best views of the mountains around it. Next mention is for the friendly staff who make you feel at home. Food that is cooked to your taste, special requirements being met for kids and their readiness to assist at any hour makes your stay enjoyable. The rooms are decent in size and come with a view too....but you need to be careful with some curious monkeys who might want to get friendly :). It is located right next to Mahatma Gandhi's Ashram and there is also a govt hospital close by...which is the only place to go to incase you need any medical assistance in Kausani.",Orator4Life,/Profile/Orator4Life,Ahmedabad,40
joshimath,"Kausani is silent town and very less commercialized as compared to Nainital & Mussoorie. Sun n Snow hill is located at wonderful location giving an amazing view to Himalayan peaks. Room quality is very good and We can site the peaks right from room. The place is far from the hustle bustle and is very calm & serene. Food at the hotel restaurant is amazing. given the nature of the place there are not many good options to dine around the hotel. Its best bet to take meals in the package. Hotel staff is very hospitable & attended us enthusiastically even at 02 AM at midnight when reached there. Highly recommended for stay for its location, food & people.",Jiten S,/Profile/JitenS374,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",50
joshimath,It was a very comfortable stay with warm attentive and cooperative management and staff. our group had a fantastic time.The food was great with a lot of variety.

joshimath,I had booked a room for 4 nights at Sun n Snow Inn through SOTC in the 2nd week of January 2011 for me and my wife. When we reached the hotel it was practically empty - infact the entire valley was empty. I realized it was the worst time to visit Kausani. This hotel is managed through Leisure holidays. As far as the hotel is concerned - the pros and cons are as follows: PROS :  - Nice view  - Service prompt  -  Heavy Duty generator is available to restore electricity  CONS:  - Broken Glass  - Very dirty shower curtain - asked to chnaged but did not  - Room was unclean - asked to change the room- Hotel staff said that others were booked but we did not see much guests.  - Room Heater was not working. Did changeit twice but these did not work. Finally the management said that none,Jit_Kolkata,/Profile/Jit_Kolkata,Kolkata,20
joshimath,"The interior of the rooms are very well done.Everyday they organize a bonfire and one of their hotel staff give a music show. the view from the hotel rooms are also awesome. Facilities like TT, library etc. make up for the stay at Kausani as this place doesnt have any major attractions.Staff is very friendly and courteous.",Poojii,/Profile/Poojii,"New Delhi, India",50
joshimath,"Stayed here for 1 night. All rooms have a great view of the mighty Himalaya's and the sunrise is a must. Every room has a large picture window with excellent views. Neat & clean. The rooms on the same floor as the dinning area / kitchen can get a little noisy @ night. Good food, nice location, excellent views. They have an evening entertainment on the terrace with a bon fire. It is a DRY / alcohol free hotel, which was a little disappointing as i would have loved to have a drink on the terrace at night. All in all, good place to stay.",devansh68,/Profile/devansh68,"Mumbai, India",40

joshimath,"Kausani is a beautiful place if you are there for seeing snow capped mountains.We were lucky to have sunny days & got money's worth during our stay with great view on all 3 days.. Sun n Snow is a nice small hotel & 12 out of 13 rooms give you the best view of the mountains. The rooms,although small are neatly done up & very well maintained. The staff are very well behaved & the service excellent. Nice place to be in if you are with your family.Although room rates are on the higher side during peak season,when we visited,it is worth the money.Do not forget to spend some time relaxing in the garden & the rooftop terrace.",Travelwisesr,/Profile/Travelwisesr,"Kolkata, India",50
joshimath,Very Special place to say in Kausani. Unlink other hotels in Kausani this is one of the best Plush property to stay. The rooms are simply great with the best possible view of the Snow Ranges.   Sunrise from the terrace along with the hot cup of tea is a must. The food is excellent and the service is to the mark.  Recommanded for couples & family.,vyasvimal,/Profile/vyasvimal,"Bengaluru, India",50
joshimath,"We reached Kausani around 1 am after a long and tiresome journey from Kashipur. The staff greeted us very well even at this ungodly hour and made sure we were comfortable.

joshimath,"We stayed at this place for 2 nights. Given the fact that Kausani does not really have much outdoor attractions, the hotel should be decently stuffed to keep the guests occupied.  Unfortunately, thats not what we found.  There were couple of badminton rackets and TT table - thats it! Also, the food quality was 'okay-okay' - nothing to write about.  The power outage situation was quite funny - on and off all the time. Couldnt see TV nor do I think they had internet connection. Sad.  Rooms were functional with monkeys hopping outside the window all the time. As the rooms did not have air-conditioning, windows had to be kept open and hence one could clearly hear whats going on in the next room.   Would say, if you have better choice, go for it.",Bombayite,/Profile/Bombayite,"Mumbai, India",30
joshimath,"I only stayed one night. Perhaps not long enough to give an extensive review of this hotel.  I wanted a reliable (with some kind of u.s.p.) place to stop over on my way from Binsar (Kumaon) to Auli (Garwhal). All part of a longer trip, with various styles of accommodation, so plenty to compare and contrast. Having being spoiled by a great all round experience in Binsar, it was a hard act to follow, and yes,  excited by the propect of seclusion in the mountains at Auli I really was just wanting a clean place to put my head down. However, all that into account, I was underwhelmed by The Sun n Snow Inn. In my mind it just didn't really live up to expectations.  I have no real complaints, I just felt relieved not to have booked in here for longer. Brought on admittedly, not just by",KinskiLondon,/Profile/KinskiLondon,London,30

joshimath,"When we booked the Lake Resort at Naukuchiatal, we learnt that they had a tie-up with Sun N Snow Inn and a price reduction as well. So, we didn‚Äôt think twice about booking this hotel.  Kausani in general, and this hotel in particular, felt like the best honeymoon spot ever. The ambience was amazing, our room was warm and wonderful with a spectacular view of the Himalayas. The moon rising from behind the mountains was fantastic and we saw that breath-taking beauty right from our window!  The beds are nice and comfortable and the bathroom is very clean.   Anashakthi Ashram, where Gandhiji stayed when in Kausani, is within walking distance from the hotel. So is the Live Planet Show (which unfortunately was closed when we were in Kausani).  Breakfast and dinner saw a buffet system",silent-reveler,/Profile/silent-reveler,Slough,40
