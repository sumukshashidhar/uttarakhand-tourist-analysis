joshimath,"We stayed in October when it was almost off season. The manager gave us discount. Food is good, behavior is very polite. Location is very good with huge glass window from where you can enjoy the beautiful sleeping beauty hill. It's away from the noise of Joshimath town. Rooms were squicky clean.",Barnali G,/Profile/BarnaliGhosal,,50
joshimath,When place is joshimath and we know managing resources are very challanging. Staff was very cooperative. Hotel rooms were clean ...Snow ladded mountains were visible from room. Service is pretty slow and food quality is not that great...thats why cutting one star.,Man_shah3110,/Profile/Man_shah3110,"Ahmedabad, India",40
joshimath,"Была разочарована в данном отеле, так как ожидала лучшего после прочтения многочисленных положительных отзывов. Отель не самый худший, но за данную стоимость ожидала увидеть что-то получше. Два номера были грязными. В туалет было страшно зайти. Вода горячая подавалась с перебоями. Малюсенького обогревателя едва хватало на одну комнату. Могу оценить данный отель на слабую троечку.",Марина Ногтикова,/Profile/mnogtikova,,20
joshimath,"Nous y sommes restés quasiment une semaine. Hôtel au pied de la station de ski Indienne Auli. Le propriétaire est charmant, accueillant et aux petits soins. Il nous a fait visité son charmant village, a organisé des visites, et nous a concocté divers barbecues. Superbe expérience familiale!",Ferran S,/Profile/95ferrans,"Mumbai, India",50
joshimath,"We stayed here for 4 days, after a trek. This is a newly-set up 6 rooms inn, run by the very obliging and hospitable Mr Suraj.  Rooms are clean, reasonably comfortable and have great views of the Sleeping Beauty mountain and others. Being road facing, the place does get a bit dusty, though rooms are well-insulated from noise.  Location-wise, the inn is on elevated land that overlooks Joshimath town; it's a 10 mins walk to town, from a short-cut path that is tiled. Not being in the town is probably better, as its too noisy there.   What sets this hotel apart is probably the attentive service and restaurant. We had daily breakfast, dinner and sometimes lunch here during our stay --  breakfast is a bit spartan but hot meals offer great comfort on cold nights, with vegetables from",Julie_Angie,/Profile/Julie_Angie,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",40
