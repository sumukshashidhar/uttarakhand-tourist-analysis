We called the owner,and expressed our condition. He sent a cab for our pickup in response which got invain due to huge water flow on roads. We spent that night in despair.

The rooms were tiny and could just accommodate small beds. Also, totally unhygienic and dirty. The washrooms were also not clean, we could see just three servants managing everything - cooking, serving guests, carrying luggage etc. Hence lot of delay in everything, food options were also limited ( ice cream and cold drinks not available ).

We tried to contact the manager and it took him so late to reach us. We had to wait for 1.5-2 hrs.Truly a bad experience. It was so unhygienic to even stand there.The bed was so firm which made impossible to sleep at night.  	The staff has zero knowledge about housekeeping,as nothing was up to date.

When we asked for a different room, the manager refused, saying the other rooms were all full - which I doubt.

When I reached the place(Delhi to Joshimath) I got a shock that he(Ajay Bhatt) has given this room to someone and didn't bother to inform me or Cleartrip. Later after having strong argument with him he provided some other hotel and that is the reason of giving him 2 stars otherwise deserve 1 star. Please always call him in advance irrespective how you booked that room.

One switch was literally broken with open wires. They didn't provide us the hand soap  saying they don't have single in stock.Kinda unprofessional! Provided single towel for booking of three!

Cons: 1) Room doors leak air from gaps all around, outside air chills the room within minutes and it stays that way. 2) No proper heaters provided, got 3 heaters replaced none of them worked properly. Believe me in december temperatures are in minus degrees and you will need proper heating to enjoy ur stay. 3) Very limited choices for food. When you ask for some sweet or bread toast.. They say bhaiya nahi h... 4) Have noticed power cuts and there is no generator, only inverter that can't take load of room heaters. 5) No tv, only in dining area they have one.

joshimath1,"This small little home converted to a home stay has excellent view from all rooms. The rooms a really well done with different color scheme for each room. The wooden flooring give a warm and cosy feel. The baths are well done. The food wasn't too great, very basic. We stay there for just 12 hrs. And had a comfortable night halt before proceeding to camp at Ghangaria for Valley of Flowers. The owner was not avai Able but the caretakers did a good job! I found the price a little steep for the facilities.",garifly,/Profile/garifly,"Nashik, India",40
joshimath1,"We stopped at this place for a night on our way to Govindghat and loved the hospitality, and the views from this place. The service was superb - the food tasty, warm and fresh. This is one of those small set ups that really know how to take care of their guests - I loved stopping by here and strongly recommend this place to everyone crossing Joshimath. The location is superb - and you can beat the Joshimath traffic on your way to Govindghat in the morning. My only suggestion to Ajay is to have a bigger sign board so that guests dont miss the place when they drive down the road... I did and had to come back...",Amit_Sengupta,/Profile/Amit_Sengupta,"New Delhi, India",50
joshimath1,"If you need a period if idyllic rest, there can be no place better. The view from the room is divine. The calm surroundings are perfect to recoup. More than the place, it is the host, Mr. Ajay Bhatt, who makes the stay even more worth it. He knows Uttarakhand very well and can create good vacation plans depending on the need. You can easily trust him.",piyushashah,/Profile/piyushashah,"Chandler, Arizona",50
joshimath1,A place... which can not be missed during your stay at Joshimath... a peaceful... calm...and excellent hospitality by Mr Ajay Bhatt and his family...a restful journey before visiting Valley of Flowers or Himkund Sahib or Badrinath....Highly recommended,Ravine T,/Profile/Ravinetrek,"Mumbai, India",50
joshimath1,"Heavenly views and homely ambience with all the the amenities one would like to have after a long tiring drive from the plains !There are very few places with clean and good facilities in and around joahimath. This place has been very well maintained and patronised by nature / adventure lovers. There is no formal reception/ room service / tv in room etc. Instead you get welcome like a family member and can feast your eyes on the amazing scenery from your room/ balcony to your heart's content. Meals are simple , but delicious and just like home food. We stayed here on our way to valley of flowers and Badrinath as well as on the way back before heading back to Rishikesh. I would definitely recommend it. Please call and book in advance.  Hitesh",Hitesh P,/Profile/HPTravel09,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",40
joshimath1,"This is a simple, clean home stay with a great view. the location is away from Joshimath town but that makes the views perfect. Its got a small library with great books. Food in the common dining was good too. Once you are in that region, you will understand the importance of clean places. And this surely is one.",Varunnayyar,/Profile/Varunnayyar,Bangalore,50
joshimath1,"Basically, we are paying for the view. If you dream to wake up with gorgeous mountain view, this is the place for you. There are few different rooms in the guest house, but i think the view are basically the same, so you do not have to pay anything extra for that. They have clean toilet and a very well functioning hot water (which is very essential in winter). The hospitality is good where the owner will keep engaging with you, not overdoing it, which i felt very welcomed. But slightly far from the Joshimath town, and the food is average. But the room is slightly pricey. because basically, everyone share the same view outside or in Joshimath, the differences are whether you can see the mountain by lying on your bed or you must walk outside to view them.",JosephMAS,/Profile/JosephMAS,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",40
joshimath1,"e stayed at Ajay's place in Jan 2012 (4 adults and 2 kids). Had shifted to his place after having stayed at the Cliff Top Club, Auli (which has pathetic service, no power and no water supply for 3 icy cold days and nights).  Himalayan Abode is located 5 kms away from Joshimath, with the most awesome views of the mountains and the river beneath from the balcony , the first view of the mighty ranges at 6:00 in the morning, one could not ask for anything more. Most affable, well mannered and accommodating owner/host Ajay, makes the experience even better. He also runs a ski instruction business so the daily trips to Auli in his car and the rigorous skiing instruction was the best introduction to skiing for a rookie.   Comfortable and clean rooms, warmed by kerosene heaters (if you",Arvind R,/Profile/AmmerAMR,"Mumbai, India",50
joshimath1,Ideal place to stay for people going to valley of flowers or govindghat. Reach there in the evening passing through the crowded and ugly joshimath town and its traffic jams. Next morning leave by 6 and you have beaten the joshimath leaving traffic that can leave only after 6 as the gates are closed till then. Reach govindghat in record time and start off for ghangariya !!  Good rooms with large glass windows showing the valley and mountains. Friendly and resourceful owner Mr Bhatt.

joshimath1,"A friend and I made our maiden trip to India last month and Joshimath was on our itinerary thanks to a recommendation from a  destination expert from Tripadvisor. We were from Rishikesh and scheduled 3 days and 2 nights stay here at this homestay. Ajay and his family were extremely warm and kind people who made anyone's stay memorable in terms of their hospitality. The homestay is located about 5 km from town but the view is just magnificent. We had the elephant mountain right in front of us and snow capped mountains on our right. Words can't express how beautiful the view was. The rooms were clean and beyond my expectation for a homestay. However, heating was limited and so was hot water in the bathroom. At temperature below zero and limited heating, we literally were freezing",Dharshini B,/Profile/dharshinib2018,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",40
joshimath1,"My boyfriend and I stayed here after finishing trekking in the area. We had a warm welcome from Ajay and his family. The room we had was beautifully decorated. We had lots of hot water, and a very comfortable nights sleep. The room had a balcony looking over the fields below and hills across the valley. The homestay is out of Joshimath so it is quieter than other hotels in the town would be. Ajay was doing some building work when we were staying - an area to be able to offer food to guests, and I'm sure that this will now be finished. Ajay has a travel company so would be able to help you out with organising treks, or skiing in the winter season.",Lucy G,/Profile/LucyG720,"Dorset, UK",50
joshimath1,"after 300 km drive to joshimath from dehradun with my family when i entered the himalayan abode at marwari i was relaxed mentally seeing all the arrangements within our room. firstly we had a warm welcome, then we had the tasty homely food. the rooms were furnished with good beds with superior quality bedding that was perfect according to the cool atmosphere there . we had a  relaxed and sound sleep .  In the morning the sun welcomed through the large windows facing the beautiful elephant and other mountains. overall we got much more than we expected at such height. we  definately would like to visit again in future.",sanjay76,/Profile/sanjay76,dehradun,50

joshimath1,"We were lucky to find Himalayan Snow Runner guide and owner Ajay, who suggested a stay in one of his available Homestays. We stayed in Marwari, Himalayan Abode, about 5 km from the city of Joshimath, he arranged transportation for us. Located on the road that runs between Badrinath and Joshimath the location cannot be beat, very quiet with sweeping views of the valley and Himalaya's. Watch or join in with the locals daily life, walk down to the Alakananda River or near by temples, or simply relax and feel the cool mountain breeze in the clean spacious room. Rooms have clean bed, fan, and large windows facing the mountains, private bathroom and some are equipped with a kitchen. We felt very welcome at this homestay and had arranged for all of our food to be provided, traveling",AnnaMalaysia,/Profile/AnnaMalaysia,Malaysia,40
