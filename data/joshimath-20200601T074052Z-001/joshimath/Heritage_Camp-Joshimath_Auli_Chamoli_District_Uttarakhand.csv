joshimath1,"To the travellers :- DO NOT stay in this accommodation as this is the worst place to stay. Either borrow a camp and stay in open in Auli or book prior in different hotels. No gyser, pathetic condition of toilets, no room heaters and on top of it, these are no rooms. A simple tent covered with tin and sheets making the so called rooms more chiller. Food :- was ok but the charges were like the 3 star hotels. We were also served half cooked food. Services :- you keep on calling for people, but will be heard when they feel like. My only review for this so called tent would be ""BETTER SLEEP IN YOUR CAR RATHER THAN taking this accommodation"".",Aniket S,/Profile/Aniket1611,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",10
