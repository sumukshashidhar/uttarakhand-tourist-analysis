joshimath1,"This hotel is average. We stayed at ground floor where rats were running through the gap between door and floor. But this hotel is very close to Auli ropeway. People are helpful. On the ground floor, there is a small place for parking and cooking.",soumeng2016,/Profile/soumeng2016,"Kolkata, India",30
joshimath1,"It is located at just 5 min walk from the taxi stand. We took a 3-bed room for just Rs.500/night. The room was sufficiently clean with basic amenities. Though the bathroom lacked a geyser and there was no TV in the room, I would say it was still well worth for the money charged.",Afridy48,/Profile/Afridy48,India,40
joshimath1,"The hotel is quite cheap and the guy working there is very nice and helpful. He can help you find bus/taxi or will give you tourism advices. As a con you can count lack of hot water, which you can compensate by paying 30 rupees for big bucket.",Wojciech G,/Profile/648wojciechg,,50
