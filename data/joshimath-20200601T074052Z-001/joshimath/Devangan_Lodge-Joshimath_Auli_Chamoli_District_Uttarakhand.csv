joshimath1,"Shepherds lodge , Devangan located on a picturesqe setting on the banks of Dhauliganga river, just 25 kms away from Joshimath. It's a must place for all people from adventure, bird watching lovers, flower valley visitors and so on. We gotta an opportunity to stay in this beautiful lodge almost a week during Nandadevi Outer Sanctuary trek.Mr. Narender Singh Rana, of Shepherds lodge, is one to contact for everything.He was the chief guide during our trekking during the month of October 2019 and made our trekking memorable one.

joshimath1,"I spend few days with my husband and my 6 year old son at Devangan lodge last October. The lodge offers all modern facilities, private bathroom and hot water. The food is freshly prepared and delicious. The setting of the lodge is extraordinary, on the banks of the Dhauli Ganga, in the beautiful Niti valley. You will fall asleep soothed by the sound of the river and the waterfall facing the lodge. Narender and his team are incredibly sweet and welcoming, and will make sure to cater for everything you need during your stay. This is a unique opportunity for honest and meaningful exchange between travellers and the local bhotiya community, and for supporting a form of tourism that seeks to benefits the locals and takes care to not disrupt their natural and social environment.

joshimath1,"We stayed at this beautiful and serene, Shepherds lodge , Devangan located on a picturesqe setting on the banks of Dhauliganga river, just 25 kms away from Joshimath. Our room door opened to a spectacular water fall view. Though our stay was a part of Nandadevi Outer Sanctuary trek organized by wonderful host Narender Singh Rana, of Shepherds lodge, one can easily spend a week here, just strolling by Lata, Reni villages, visit Bhavishya badri temple,explore Niti valley; experiencing the distinctive Bhotiya culture, who worship Nandadevi mountain as their patron goddess. Narender Rana will arrange everything, vehicles to guides and will treat you like his family member, going out of his way to make sure your stay is comfortable. We left the place with heavy heart, knowing that we",sandeep.m434,/Profile/sandeep-m-4341,,50
joshimath1,"Tapovan is a beautiful valley...Located just 30-40km from Joshimath it feels like you have entered a sanctuary away from the crowd and bustle of Joshimath, and Shepherd's Lodge the ideal place to stay and enjoy it. It has clean and cosy rooms overlooking a beautiful waterfall, plenty of accessible day hike options and great food. The owner Narendar bhai is a local and can give you lots of tips on where to go and how to get there. For those up for more of an adventure he can organize games, sightseeing and multi day treks also.  He really made us feel so much at home that we ended up extending our stay there by 2 days.",Medha_K,/Profile/Medha_K,"Mumbai, India",50
joshimath1,"We decided to go to Devangan on our way to Badrinath Ji instead of staying at overcrowded and noisy Joshimath. We had to travel 25 km more, but it was absolutely worth it. Devangan is located at a very picturesque point, with Rishi Ganga on one side and Lata village on the other. Beyond the river is a huge rock like mountain, adding to the beauty of this place. The rooms and facilities are good, the staff is very helpful and polite, food is delicious and they try to incorporate your special requirements in food. Narendra, the owner, showed us the mini museum he has built with in Devangan, with exhibits like the ancient jewllery, farm equipment, utensils, the instruments used to weave carpets. It gave a good insight into the Bhotiya community, culturally very rich Bhotiyas,",Pratiba N,/Profile/shruti101,"Mumbai, India",50
joshimath1,"Very beautiful and peaceful surroundings. Waterfall,river and a huge mountain is there to welcome you right opposite to shepherd 's lodge. Clean rooms and nice hospitality. A must visit place atleast once for nature lovers.",PinkMeher,/Profile/PinkMeher,,50
joshimath1,"The trip started with the cheerful Shri Dharman Singhji driving us from Joshimath towards Lata village.  On the way as one winds deeper into the hills the views are spectacular, we stopped at “view points” from where we got breathtaking views of the Nanda Devi range. Along the road near the view point there was also a place with a “hot spring”.  Upon reaching the Devangan Lodge, we were greeted by Narendra (with whom we had interacted many years ago) it was like a homecoming!  The place offers comfortable accommodation, healthy local food and plenty of fresh air.  Short day treks to the Lata village is quite a joyful experience As one winds in and out of the houses staggered on the face of the hill, you can't help but notice the friendly people of the village. Meeting so many",Dibendu Bose,/Profile/dibendubose,,50
joshimath1,"Relying on the weather forecast we reached a day before the predicted snowfall. The weather started closing after breakfast, we decided to drive to  Suraithota, a small market  5 kms upstream of the lodge. The snowfall started as we reached the market of Suraithota, we immediately returned to the lodge. It snowed for two days. The hike to the winter village gave us an opportunity to understand how people manage during extreme weathers. Part of the reason to choose Devangan Lodge was to spend some time with nature but not in a crowed hill station. Fortunately, our group of 5 was the only one in the lodge. The rooms are cozy and the food is great. The hot water turns ice water before one remove cloths for the bathing! Devangan is not a place for those  looking for TVs in the room",@Masat_Malang101,/Profile/Mast_Malang101,,50

joshimath1,It was an unexpectedly amazing trip. The lodge is at a beautiful location with an easy access. Not only the place gives a pocket friendly stay but the food is also simple and tasty. The staff is very cordial. They provide safe trekking and camping facilities as well which is a must try. If one wants to see the real Uttarakhand and the Himalayas then you must visit this place in Niti valley and enjoy their tour guide facilities to the maximum.,rommila chandra,/Profile/rommila,,50
joshimath1,"Actually we reached late in the evening and  were totally confused as it was all dark and scary once we left Tapovan. We called the manager couple of times asking how far we have to drive. Anyways the reception was warm and we were too tired to explore except the roaring sound of river which was not assuring at all. The morning views changed everything . It's just lovely, you are so close to the elements of nature. As advised, we hiked to summer Lata Village. Never saw so many smiling people in my life. Good place, don't expect luxuries. Totally safe for families.",rana,/Profile/puran76,,50
joshimath1,The campus is really big and located very near to the Dhouli Ganga river and one can see the meandering gentle flow on the valley floor. The day trip to the summer Lata  village was interesting . The place has lot of cultural heritage.  Rooms are basic and comfortable.  Enjoyed the  organic food and ghee from the village.  For nature lovers it's a real treat,Uttam R,/Profile/UttamR67,,50
joshimath1,"Devangan Lodge is located 25 km further  up from Joshimath on Niti Road. The facility is neat and hygienic with excellent  food but limited options. Those looking for a crowded hill station avoid this place. Its in a isolated, peaceful, totally safe and beautiful location. A treat for nature lovers. The campus is large  and the kids enjoyed the place. As advised by the staff we drove up to the last village of Niti",489aakash,/Profile/489aakash,,50
joshimath1,"Stayed two nights during the Interpretative Trek to Nanda Devi National Park in late summer of 2018. Its a nice property with huge campus and stunning views located by the river side of Dhouli Ganga. Highly recommended to off road travelers and nature lovers who can survive without Tv and connectivity. Food is home made and the boys are not actually business minded, i mean no plastic similes.",Ranachaam1,/Profile/RanaChaam111,,50
