joshimath,"The hotel's USP is its location!!! The view of the majestic Himalayan range in the foreground is breathtaking If you happen to stay here in winter, be ready to shell out rs 350 per room heater as its very cold and one cannot survive without the heater. Surprisingly, the heater charge is not included in the room price and is added to the bill using pencil by the hotel reception staff. The restaurant takes time to prepare food and its advisable to place your order well in advance to avoid waiting time. The restaurant staff is very nice, helpful and courteous The lawn is well kept and is a nice place for some good photographs You can go up to the terrace for a nicer view of the peaks There is ample parking space and the hotel and rooms are spacious enough Good for a one time stay!!!",prakashorchid,/Profile/prakashorchid,,30

joshimath,I travelled Kausani in the month of June End. I stayed at 5 days in Kishna MountView.   June - July month you will not enjoy 180 degree snow mount view - for which Kausani is famous for. In June July its almost claudy atmosphere so its little disappointing. However its purely on luck sometimes you will see some of the Nandadevi / trushul snow peaks.  Resort is super awesome. I would say mesmerising view from the resort. Every room is having 180 degree snowview facing. From the room you can do himalaya darshan.   Resort do not have AC rooms however in the month of june (specially in afternoon) you might need AC. But again morning and evening is pleasant.   Room size are average. Bathrooms are hygiene.

joshimath,One of the best hotel at very small place Kasauni.  Located next to Aashram with very well maintained garden.  Rooms are quite good as not so big neither small.  Neat and tidy hotel is from all around.  Food is good as standard is very well maintained.  Service is bit slow whereas pleasant. Have to order food much before for preparation and waiting time can be 20 to 30 minutes. Location is very good as Wide range of Himalayan view is just  from the room itself. So value for money hotel is.  Kasauni is worth visiting for atleast 2 Nights as beyond Kasauni neither Chaukori nor Munsiyari will provide such Wide range of Himalayan view which Kasauni provides.  Will Rate Kasauni -- THE BEST PLACE to VISIT from other places as Chaukori and Munsiyari.  Roads to Chaukori are good and,21Abhishek,/Profile/21Abhishek,"Thane, India",50

joshimath,Went to this resort to view sunset & suntise. Our room was stinking and there was lot of noise of visitors even after 10pm. Some visitors came there in team and they were making so much noise that we couldn‚Äôt sleep. We requested the care taker of resort to ask those vistors to not shout so much. I guess at around 11.45pm they went for sleep. Room service was good. Food was good. Resort is beautiful. One more thing the person who do booking should inform visitors beforehand that may is not a month to visit this place for viewing sunrise or sunset.As in this month forest catches fire due to excess heat of summer season and the mountains become invisible due to smog. So it was waste of time for us to visit there as we went there for mountain view which we missed due to smog.,Poonam Verma,/Profile/sipniprelish,"Noida, India",30
joshimath,"Went with family and it proved to be such a disaster. It was not just one thing which went wrong. I will mention each and every bad experience:  1) No mini fridge, tea coffee maker in the room 2) The intercom facility doesn't allow you to call room to room 3) On the first day I was refused lunch service in the room. On arguing and insisting I was provided. 4) Wi fi was not working 5) Food and water provided are not reliable as all of us got diarrhoea 6) Two complimentary bottles of mineral water which all hotels/resorts give were not provided 7)We ordered for French fries for dinner and it was refused citing reason as it will take long.

They need to work on their dining area-the tables and plates were dusty and the breakfast took 45 minutes to reach our table from the time of ordering. However, all of these aspects can be overlooked except for the incident that happened during our checkout.  Usually all hotels in the mountain area provide a heater in the room, but this one had added charges. The house keeping person himself placed the heater on a table which was atleast at one feet distance from the bed.

This hotel is situated at a fair height and has the advantage of large balconies in each room. One does not have to move out anywhere.  Rooms are rather cramped. They charge heavily for the room heater. The hot water timings are limited (mornings and evenings);still manageable. Service attitude is excellent. Belongs to the Krishna group and the good standard is maintained Food is ok though not great. Basically, one goes to Kausani mainly for the mountain view and that is adequately met here.

The main plus point of this hotel is its location and the panoramic views of the Himalayas it gives right from your bedroom. Plus all rooms have a sit out /balcony where you can relax. The hotel has beautiful lawns and flower garden and a terrace. As regards the food and housekeeping, all the things are up to the mark. Only thing to beware of is the monkeys who can try to enter your balcony or room if left open.

joshimath,We went to Kausani without making any bookings & saw several other hotels before choosing this one. To be honest our criteria to choose was based upon the good deal which we received comparatively & location next to Gandhi Ashram. We took executive room & it turned out to be a good option. All their rooms face mountain view but we have to get up early to get the best mountain view as later hours mountains are hidden in mist. The gardens are very well maintained just in front of the hotel. Their restaurant named 'Vaibhav' at the lobby level was decent & amazingly the food was good. The staff was helpful & friendly.

I have never seen Himalyas in real life and was completely astonished to see it.  It still remains in my memory and I feel I have lost my heart at this place and have plans to visit this place alongwith complete family next year.  As true to their nature, people from mountains are very helpful, so is staff of this hotel equally welcoming and courteous.   Hotel staff is advised to serve some local mountain cousine in dinner and add fitness centre.  Food is mount-watering at this place and recommended for a stay.

The garden is very beautifully maintained, the flowers, fruit trees are outstanding, the rooms have exceptionally great view which you may not get from best of the 5 Star Hotels. The rooms are average, clean but small in size. The food and service is good. There were not too many guests in the hotel but the service offered by the staff was decent.

When we checked out they were not accepting credit card, because they said that the machine does not work. So we had to pay cash.

We paid quite a handsome amount and in return the room we got was just about manageable. The view from the hotel is supposed to be quite beautiful but during June, there was a lot of smoke in the nearby jungles due to which the view of snowcapped mountains was nowhere to be seen.

Trust me it has good 4 star hygiene standards intact so far.""  Cons:  * when you are offering suite at a hefty price in peak winters, kindly dont charge your guests for petty room heater.

We were maybe a bit unusual in that we stayed for multiple nights...most people seemed to swoop in for a night and leave the next day, but we wanted to totally veg out and relax. The view of the mountains from the rooms is superb. Recommend getting a second storey room (which are numbered 200+) because of the private balcony. If you can, get a room furthest from the lobby area because you'll avoid the two massive trees outside the property that block a part of the view. Room was clean.

But the hotel otherwise is quite ordinary. The rooms are 30% smaller than the city hotels and there is absolutely no place to walk around the room. The furniture is quite old and the food is also nothing to rave about. The extra bed from the hotel (in case you've asked for it is arranged by removing the other remaining furniture around the room). Service is quite good and staff are friendly.

After my stay, I have no second opinion to this...Indeed it is ""The Smartest in Kausani"" Placed next to the icon of Kausani, Mahatma Gandhi's Ansakti Ashram, Krishna is no less than another icon.
