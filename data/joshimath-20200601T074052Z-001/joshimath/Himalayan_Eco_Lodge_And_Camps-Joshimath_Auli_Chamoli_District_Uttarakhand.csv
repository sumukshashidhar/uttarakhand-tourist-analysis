joshimath1,"I had booked this hotel upon seeing good reviews of this hotel on various sites. But during my recent trip to Auli we had car problem which got stuck on the hill areas.We tried to contact the hotel early morning on phone but there was no one to answer the call.   Unfortunately, due to chilling cold conditions I had to return back to Joshimath and book another hotel at an additional cost.

joshimath1,"I had checked-in here during last week of May, 2019, having booked 3 rooms ( family of 7 people ). we were allotted 2 front facing Himalayan View rooms and one Orchard View rooms. The Himalayan V/Rooms were just besides the reception-cum-dining area with good views of the Himalayas, but the Orchard View rooms were the ones where the ......starts.  They were across the main PWD road, below the road height , on the slopes....but instead of being enjoyable, they were quite mysterious and ( if i can put my own experience ) they were quite horrific. Not only the path and big huge steps leading to those 5 Orchard View rooms is not at all recommended, even for a normal healthy 40+ aged couple, but were quite potholed and undulated and risky overall. we had thought of shifting our 16-21",AdityaM2013,/Profile/AdityaM2013,"Kolkata, India",30
joshimath1,"Enjoyed our stay at Himalayan Eco Lodge. We stayed for 3 nights and used as a base location for a day trip to Badrinath and Auli ski resort. Those who doesn't like to stay in road side hotels in Badrinath ,its perfect place to stay. Staff is very friendly and helpful.Its peaceful with well maintained rooms and gardens.   Some of the important points to ensure you get best of experience here.  1. Book Himalayan view rooms only.  Orchard rooms are down the hill and bit too far from dinning area and main resort place.  2. Ensure give a call before reaching ,last few meters are difficult to identify the location so better give a call to get right guidance.   3. There are no tvs in rooms to give you a full relaxing stay. A large size tv is available in the dinning area in case",mohit k,/Profile/446mohitk,,40

The quality of food was also bad with literally no taste. In spite of giving repeated reminders the staff didn't pay any heed, as they are aware they have a total monopoly and guest will definitely come.  In spite, of telling manager to prepare snacks in the evening they forgot and refused to serve, after in spite of repeated reminders they made something quick which was way below average.

joshimath1,"We were excited to stay at Himalayan Eco lodge much before we even reached Auli. The happiness only elevated on getting to such a wonderful place amidst lovely, delightful snow claden hills. We had planned our stay for 2 nights there and we never experienced even a bit of disappointment.   On the day of stay, though we had reached Joshimath a bit late than expected, HEL arranged us cabs to get us to the lodge as quickly as possible without leaving us stranded in the chill breeze for a long time. We were welcomed at the lodge and the family of HEL familiarized themselves unlike any other resorts or places I have been. The food served was hot and excellent for the bitter cold.   They also arranged us a bon fire next to our room, for it was personal to us and we had our own space",Shisavaranya,/Profile/Shisavaranya,"Chennai, India",50
joshimath1,"As the heading of my review suggest, ppl are so nice and warm go out of their way to                   make your stay comfortable. Word of  advice done come here if you expect 5 star luxury. It's a nice homely place with very warm and helpful ppl. They will go out of their way to meet your expectations. Food has homely taste and enough variety. You have warm water available all the time. Room heaters and more than enough blankets. Bonefire is arranged every night. I stayed with my wife and my friends and we were the only people in the resort. They also do adventure tracks and skiing.

joshimath1,I stayed in Himalayan Eco lodges in two intervals while I went for the trek on Valley of Flowers and Hemkund. At such a height the lodge is equipped with everything that is required to tackle the freezing cold. Located amid varied varieties of flowers and picturesque location this is an apt way to spend some time in the nature's lap.  Overall I would say it was a great experience. If I visit Auli again I would blindly book Himalayan Eco Lodges.,Ruby S,/Profile/150rubys,"Noida, India",40
joshimath1,"The lodge is perfectly located with the view of the snow clad ranges in front. morning times the view is beautiful with fog covering the peaks. The lodge is away from the rush and that gives the serenity that you would experience while staying here.  The rooms are comfortable and the services are pretty good. The team there will take care of you as if you have come to their house. The food they offer is also good. Hot and Cold water are both available  The landscaping around the lodge is also beautiful and you have a range of flowers and trees bearing fruits, when we had traveled we could see apples, apricots,  walnuts, peaches.",aman_malhotra,/Profile/aman_malhotra,"Bangkok, Thailand",50

joshimath1,While I was planning for a travel to the Mountains someone had suggested me Uttarakhand as an ideal destination for trekkers. I booked a trek with Thrillophilia which in turn introduced me to GIO.  Travel I believed was never about places it was always about people. And I guess your team conformed my belief on the same. Ofcourse the landscapes of Valley of Flowers and the mesmerizing Hemkund was worth a visit. But without your Team's Support and experience the same wouldn't have been possible.  A special mention of people without whom I guess this wouldn't have been such a beautiful experience..  Rajan ji - A thorough professional..

joshimath1,"The HEL resorts are owned and managed by Great Indian Outdoors. Had stayed in this resort for 3 nights as a couple. This resort is located about 6 kms before Auli in a picturesque setting with amazing views of the mountains and snow capped peaks. The resort has about 12 rooms. All rooms have an attached bathroom with geysers. There is a nice sit out area where you can watch the roses in full bloom, the amazing views and the birds chirping and singing. A very peaceful setting. Most importantly the rooms are clean, with adequate blankets and just enough furniture.   The food prepared by the chef is excellent. Simple and homely food, tasty and hygienic. It can get cold in the nights and heaters that are more than adequate are available for guests.

joshimath1,"After almost 3 years of having a child, my wife and me decided to have a trip without the kid. We were bound for Badrinath and Hemkund Sahib. After evaluating various options, we zeroed in on Auli as a base station as it's very close to Joshimath but much more picturesque.  After consulting and reading several reviews on Trip Advisor we decided to have our stay booked at Himalayan Eco Lodges in Auli as this seemed to be a perfect place where we wanted to rest in solitude before and after our hectic and tiring schedule of Hemkund Sahib/Valley of Flowers trek. The rooms were fine, but the upkeep was poor. There was dust on the table, water glasses and sofas in the room. This really puts me off as it shows how much you care for your customer. There service was not good either.",Pranav N,/Profile/PranavN_11,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",20
joshimath1,"We stayed in Auli from 4th - 6th June 2015. Best part of this lodge is that it offers almost 270 degree view of Himalaya, though from Auli there is hardly any place from where Himalaya is not visible but it's more spectacular from here.  Rooms are spacious with neat beddings, though toilets were ok, walls are of gypsum instead of bricks with some insulation in between which though makes rooms retain heat but you can clearly hear noises from adjacent room.  Food is excellent and staff is quite courteous inline with other Himalayan Eco Lodges, overall a refreshing experience.",Prateek J,/Profile/PrateekJ136,,50

They have 10 rooms plus 5 more a little away from the main hotel.  Guys, this is not a traditional hotel per say. It is a typical bed and breakfast accomodation. There is no restaurant. There is a dinning area where breakfast, lunch and dinner are served as buffet.  Rooms The rooms are basic, they have a king size double bed. We had an extra bed (paid for) for our kid. The bathroom is attached and has a geyser. The best part about the room is the front porch. It faces the mountains and the view is absolutely breath taking.

joshimath1,I had booked a trek with GIO to Pangarchula Peak and Kuari Pass in April 2015. I stayed here for 2 nights in total. The room was very comfortable with a good and soft bed. Lights were proper. There was a heater in my room which worked fine. The washroom was clean and tidy with hot water available throughout.  Coming to the food. It was simple but very well prepared. The people out there are very nice and hospitable. They are polite and humble and always try to make you feel at home. Also about the location. It has good views of peaks around and is a little off city which according to me is a plus point. It is a nice and quiet place.

The manager in place, Jaychand and his staff are simply superb. We were literally pampered and food was very good, more homely than restaurant.

Firstly, a note that this place is not exactly at Auli but on route to Auli (6km before Auli) and there is a small detour which is easy to miss (we missed!) so be careful. The actual lodge itself is kind of work in progress I guess and I expect (hope) the physical infrastructure to get better. there is nothing miss, its just that finishing work of doors, tiles etc looks a bit unprofessional. But the best part of the lodge was the staff there who was very courteous and always ready to help. They cooked excellent food (especially given the location). On the final day, they had breakfast and packed lunch ready for us at 7am!
