joshimath1,"Strictly Avoid Mount View in Joshimath! Their are many more better options with better prices, view & service. The manager and owner are their for nothing. Do not advance book, they will assign you their worst rooms.",Ashwani G,/Profile/ashwanig2016,"Kausani, India",10
joshimath1,I used this hotel as a stop for a trek amongst the mountains. It is a budget hotel which after trekking I consider a luxury. Showers were great and the rooms were clean. The staff despite not having English were extremely helpful and did their best. The staff want to help and will gladly help you on your journey. Food was great. It's a basic hotel but in the mountains a luxury.  Thanks,John S,/Profile/Staffo2014,"Dublin, Ireland",40
joshimath1,"We stayed for 2 nights on different days as part of a large group.  We were 3 ppl sharing a room and it was a spacious comfortable room.  The room was clean and the one time we ordered room-service, it was prompt and good food.  The bathrooms were neat and the geyser worked perfectly.  I think, they have power-cut issues, but their inverter was good and we were atleast able to switch the lights on in the room.  Their roof top dining area was adequate and gave beautiful views of the surrounding mountains and valley.  It was a very decent overnight stay on both occasions.",Tam M,/Profile/hereandthere09,"Visakhapatnam (Vizag), India",30
joshimath1,I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights enroute to badrinath and got booked via a travel agent representing sampoorna yatra.   I liked the following in the hotel 1.Good View 2. Friendly staff  This is what i did not like 1. Dirty room 2. Dirty and leaking toilet 3. Below Average Food quality 4. Poor management  I visited this hotel when badrinath opened. The tariff is something around 5000/night. The quality of stay that i experienced was nothing if compared to the cost per night.. i observed that they really did not care about the quality as it was peak season and joshimath does not have much decent hotels. The local restaurants offer cheaper and better quality food.  My travel agent was kind enough to forcefully make me and my family stay in this hotel by making last minute,MANIK S,/Profile/MANIKS163,,20
joshimath1,"Very helpful staff - Thanks Sharon and team for a great trip to Chamoli, Joshimath and Auli snofall,   Quick , fast efficient service from my personal agent, nothing was too much trouble, everything explained fully, and felt valued for my trip",Sunil K,/Profile/sunaxismax,"New Delhi, India",30
joshimath1,I visited joshimath  along with my two friends in the month of June 2017. We decided to stay in hotel mount view there for our two (2)  days visit. We stayed in super delux room so we thought that the services would be good but I can't explain the behaviour of staff . They were so rude and unprofessional. They were properly serving to some of there regular customers and didn't even come to us to take order themselves . It took them 2 hours to serve us and they were not even sure about the availability of the food in there kitchen. They took order first and came back to say that the item was not available with them . The quality of food was just ok and the room was good . When We asked them about AULI they said nothing is there to see at this time and didn't even provide any    ,Digvijay M,/Profile/DigvijayM4,,10
joshimath1,Joshimath is a very beautiful place on the way to Auli or Badarinath.temple. The hotel is also good for stay overnight as hotels in Auli are very expensive. We can take cable car for going to Auli from here.,piyu1969,/Profile/piyu1969,"Mumbai, India",40
joshimath1,"A fine budget property in the laps of mountains. This property is best for budget travelers looking for a budget and comfortable stay. Food is not very good, but the staff is friendly and supportive. The hotel in in main market and is available in hardly 2-5 minutes of drive while arriving to joshimath. 24*7 Room service is available.",Travels k,/Profile/Travelsk2,,30
joshimath1,"at the very onset,be very clear that its a mid-range / budget hotel but a rather good one..  Room- we opted for room with a view..It was nice and clean with all basic facilities..  Staff -staff lacked the basic hospitality smile...looked like they are doing job under some immense pressure however they did arrange everything we requested .Also,staff is honest as we forgot few things in the hotel room and proceeded for Shree badrinath but hotel staff called us to inform that all our stuff is safe..we collected the same while returning..   Location - Centralized location,walking distance to main market area  Overall Review - Good budget hotel for staying with family !!",Just Google : Inside Out with Rahul Yuvi,/Profile/RahulYuvi,"New Delhi, India",30
joshimath1,"Decent place to stay for a short trip  . You have the basic amenities , clean beds , wash room , hot water and tv. Its close to jyothir math and auli rope way. Had food at a nearby hotel marwari , that was decent . The hotel beside this seem to have a better view and sit out . Malhari inn or something like that. That's worth a check out ",swamiragini,/Profile/swamiragini,"Hyderabad, India",30
joshimath1,It is defining it's name the view of mountain . Outside the rooms in front of restaurant a beautiful view of mountains are there. So beautiful. Must see outside at early morning. It's awesome. Very helpful people of hotel.,Ankit D,/Profile/940ankitd,"Panchkula, India",40
joshimath1,"In Joshimath, a hotel with car parking on Main road is a boon, as the Drivers told me.  We had halted for 2 nights on the way to Badrinathji.  This is a new hotel having decent rooms, clean and hygenic.  They have a small restt upstairs, which is not so clean but the cook & service staff will cook as per your reqt.  We had ordered home style khichdi and aloo paratha and it was taken care of. The Ropeway to kasauli starts closeby.  But staying on the rooms facing road is not comfortable as the traffic starts at 5am and its difficult for light sleepers",Vikas_kg,/Profile/Vikas_kg,"Ludhiana, India",40
joshimath1,Reasonable rate for rooms. Basic amenities but everything in working condition. Only glitch is food that can be worked out better. Front desk person sorry don't remember  the name but was very helpful. Thanks ,kameya225,/Profile/kameya225,"Mumbai, India",50
joshimath1,We had booked a deluxe room online in this hotel three months prior to the visit. Yet the manager gave us the worst room that was just below the road side and we could hear trucks passing by. After a lot of argument with the manager and boss they agreed to shift us to the mountain view room. The rooms were well furnished and clean. Service was very expensive. Clean and spot less sheets. Would be nicer if they didn't try to cheat the customers. ,Aditi C,/Profile/921aditic,"Mumbai, India",20
joshimath1,"We had terrible experience at Both GMVNL guest houses at Joshimath,during our onward journey to Auli.  During our return journey, our cab driver took us to Hotel Mount View, Joshimath. It's a decent hotel.Rooms are quite big, with AC, Intercom facilities. Toilet is clean with Geyser & they provide basic toiletries.  Since this was a non peak season, we could bargain a lot on the room tariff.  I believe, this is a practise for the whole year. Though, due to non peak season, their kitchen was closed , we arranged our snack, dinner from a near by restaurant. You can try your food at Paradise Restaurant, Joshimath, which is very close to Hotel Mount View. It's a hotel, worth staying as a transit hotel.",rsengupta_ncpl,/Profile/rsengupta_ncpl,"Kolkata, India",30
joshimath1,"Stayed in Deluxe room  - Clean room which includes two beds with warm blankets, attached bathroom with water geyser, poor room heater, TV, telephone - Overpriced food.

joshimath1,No complimentary breakfast may be the best hotel next to Hotel Dronagiri.  Joshimath has very few good hotels.  Small car park available.  Rooms are small but neat.  Old type TV with only Hindi channels.  Only soap is provided.  No view from rooms as in the main city.  Located on the main inner road.  Food is made to order  and  good  to  taste.   Check  in  Check  out  smooth.  Room service good.  Bed coffee only at 7 AM.  No lift is available.  No AC.  No room heater OK Hotel.,Cheran B,/Profile/CheranB,"Chennai, India",30
joshimath1,"Josimath is a place which is right on the main Highway leading to Badrinath and Hemkund Sahib. Its also a District HQ and therefore it has become very crowded. Life is most of the time in a year very difficult here and therefore maintaining a Hotel is not an easy task. Considering those aspects, Mt. View Hotel is a reasonable place to stay for a night. Most people stay here for one night only. Joshimath is also a junction from where the Road branches off to ""Auli"" another Hill station famous for Winter Sports.

joshimath1,"We were advised to take a night halt at Joshimath on our route from Haridwar to Badrinath. Joshimath is 10-12 hours drive from Haridwar. And after such a long hilly journey, this Hotel Mountview is the most pathetic place to stay. Poor room qualities; lack of trained staff make you feel more tired. Food is ok but pricey - certainly not worth the price paid for. Overall too expensive for the quality and comfort  Clearly, this place is a complete ""AVOID"". Alternate Hotel next door seems better option with no food option though.",1608ABI1979,/Profile/1608ABI1979,"Mumbai, India",20

Me and my wife were on a tour to Auli last month (Dec'13), We booked a double room at hotel mount view for two nights. Starting from check in we felt the warmth of hospitality. Some how the staff came to know about my birthday which was on 15th Dec. and they organized a surprise cake and candle lit dinner for us. It was a big big surprise for me when I was celebrating my birthday after few days of actual date at a beautiful place with awesome people.
