joshimath1,"Terribly maintained property Extremely filthy and dirty rooms No heaters Traditional heater is given in the room which takes ages to heat!!! Very dirty and stinky toilets,totally unclean and unhygienic. Infact,I fell sick after 2 nights of stay and was terribly ll Food is OK The room must not have been cleaned in ages!! Totally disappointed but what to do? Had no choice since all homestays,hotels,resorts were full My bad luck Overpriced too!!!",Vishal2805,/Profile/Vishal2805,"Mumbai, India",10

joshimath1,"It is a very good property with excellent staff that was always ready to meet any requests that we made (always with a smile). I travelled to Joshimath during Dec end (2018) with family, mainly with a view of going to Auli ""for some snow""... The hotel staff was very helpful in helping us get tickets for the Cable Car (many people did not get it, it was kind of peak season) and i am really grateful to them for the same... The food was good and I had (for my family) two of the best rooms (room # 11 & 12). One was big, spacious and both had running hot water in Wash basins too (luxury in cold climate). Bathrooms were clean and overall the property was good (it had tents too - a little higher up on the hill to be reached by stairs).  The only (and a big one) downside was that",Vikrant1980,/Profile/Vikrant1980,"Bengaluru, India",30

joshimath1,"We had booked 3 swiss tent for our group for Auli during our trip to Uttarakhand. The hotel staffs  were so humble and pollite.They kept reaching us over phone during the day of check in to help us to reach their resort.They sent route maps through whatsapp. They sent menu card asking for our orders to keep the food ready while we check-in. The resort in itself is very beautiful. It is very neatly maintained, super comfortable and has an amazing view of the snow clad mountain just outside our tents.We will highly recommend tents for stay.They are very well maintained.

joshimath1,"We were 6 students who wanted accommodation surrounded by mountains without burning a hole in our pockets. Location: Its about a kilometer away from the main road to Joshimath. Rooms: We booked our stay 1 night in the camp and 1 day in the rooms.Both were very comfortable and we enjoyed them equally. We were there during mid December. The room heaters in the camps and the rooms kept the cold winds from reaching us.We were also provided with bonfire on request. Dining: There provide room service as well as in house dining. Staff: very cordial , polite and helpful.  There was someone to accompany us all the rope way to Auli. Ambience: Carefully handpicked and beautifully maintained. Feels like being at home.  In short we got a lot more than we had expected.We have promised to come",rite2amrita,/Profile/rite2amrita,"Pune, India",50
joshimath1,"We booked 1 deluxe and 3 swiss tent rooms on twin sharing basis when we went to Joshimath in this hotel. The hotel staffs (Vinod, Anil and others) were so friendly right from inquiry of accommodation, to booking, to check-in until check-out. They are approachable for any queries related to local temples and other sight seeing places. They kept reaching us over phone during the day of check in to help us reach their place. They sent route maps through whatsapp. They sent menu card asking for our orders to keep the food ready while we check-in. This resort is about 1 km away from Joshimath on Auli Road. During check-in and check-out, staffs helped us with carrying luggages to room and to our cab. Hotel manager gave us another deluxe room without any extra cost as it was available",Srinivasan S,/Profile/ssrini21,"Chennai, India",50
joshimath1,Resort Dream Mountain situated in the outskirts of Joshimath. Very well maintain property by resort owner Mr. Fonia.

They served vegetarian and non-veg food and the quality of food was OK.,Sarathi Tours,/Profile/DattarajK,"Mumbai, India",40
joshimath1,Good place to stay away from city noise. Also market is easily accessible from hotel. Good & staff service and enjoy home cook food. I would recommend others to try the tents in Dream Mountain which we missed because all of them were booked. You can also enjoy the bonfire in the night.  However my one suggestion to Dream Mountain would be to improve the quality of rooms.,amitchatterjeea,/Profile/amitchatterjeea,"New Delhi, India",40
joshimath1,"A Lovely resort tucked high up in the hills with great food and great service. We opted to stay in the deluxe room than in a tent and found the himalayab interiors lovely. It is a great place to wake up in with a fantastic view of the mountains. Our only regret was that we did not spend enough time here, enjoy the blooming flowers and the majestic mountains. It is the ideal place to rest after Badrinath journey",Divya7,/Profile/Divya7,"Chennai, India",50

joshimath1,It's a super cute place . High service . It's like a home away from home . We stayed in the luxury tents . They can be cleaned better . We saw their super deluxe rooms and they were fab. We did not get those as they were full. The place has a lot of flowers and lovely views . Tents are not for the elderly - there are a lot of steps. The staff and manager is very very nice . They also make for you whatever you want . ,sarikagr0ver,/Profile/sarikagr0ver,"New Delhi, India",40
joshimath1,"The staff were incredibly nice to us during our entire time there. Right from giving us their most comfortable tents, to serving warm, homemade, tasty food, to arranging vehicles for us to travel around, to arranging a guide for our trek, to putting the biggest smiles on our faces when we left, they did their very best for us!  We had had a horrible experience with our cab driver on our way to Joshimath. We were unable to reach there on our first night. But, the people at Dream Mountain Resort were kind enough to not charge us for the first day. Even though we had made our advance payment for that day earlier, they were incredibly nice to no not charge us.   The resort in itself is very beautiful.

joshimath1,"I have recently visited this place and seriously it was the best location I was searching. View from this resort is awesome with perfect staff services. Food is also tasty and available at reasonable prices. If you are flowers lover then go visit here.   I preferred luxurious tent which gives the flavor of camping on hill side. Staying in this resort is better than staying in Auli as place is spacious, peaceful, scenic views all around and near to the market of joshimath.  In short: Best views, good quality food, clean rooms, reasonable prices and perfect staff services.  Thanks, Akhil",Akhil S,/Profile/436akhils,"Noida, India",50
