joshimath1,"If you don't have any expectations this hotel will serve the purpose. Its walkable distance from the market and Ropeway. The rooms are very basic and the restaurant is attached to this hotel. They serve you average food. The time we stayed in Dec middle had snowfall and no electricity. Hotel only provided a few hours in the morning and evening generator. Room size is ok , can recommend to stay 1 to 2 days. Its very near to Adhisakara mutt where Guruji prayed.",Raga,/Profile/raga83,"Singapore, Singapore",30
joshimath1,"Hotel Shailja is just a short walk from the GMOU bus ticketing office. The inter-city buses depart from here, so if you need to catch an pre-dawn bus to Rishikesh or Haridwar, this hotel's location is ideal.  The rooms are very basic and quite small, with a small attached bathroom. It seemed clean. Towels and soap were provided. The hotel has a restaurant attached. The food is nothing to write home about.   If you don't need anything more than a place for the night, Hotel Shailja will do.",GreyVitriol,/Profile/GreyVitriol,"New Delhi, India",30
