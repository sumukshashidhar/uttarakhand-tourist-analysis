joshimath1,A value for money place to stay. Three of us stayed here for a night and the rooms are simple and basic with all the amenities. The owner of this hotel is humble and nice person. Was very helpful whenever we needed some information and assistance. Overall its a nice place to stay,jazzwantgill,/Profile/jazzwantgill,"Ipoh, Malaysia",50
