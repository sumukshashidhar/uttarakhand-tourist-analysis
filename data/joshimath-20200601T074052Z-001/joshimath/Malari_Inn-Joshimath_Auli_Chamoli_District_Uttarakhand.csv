joshimath1,"Staff was supportive.. excellent experience.. perfect location with the awesome view.. room were clean, had an excellent new year celebration with them. Value for money would like to visit again and for a much longer stay.",sandeepgochar,/Profile/sandeepgochar,"Indore, India",40
joshimath1,"- I had a stay in this hotel and booked a room for 6 beds (with 2 washrooms). The room was complete insulated with a single window which opens at a place where the staff members could see inside the room as they are living just at next to it.  - We had to call staff for each and every basic item (like water, soap) and bathrooms had also bad smell. So, I had to call staff to spray some perfume and put odonil into it.  - The hotel has a shared parking with another hotel. So, if you want to park your car, they will go to another hotel and take the key.  - Restaurants near to this hotel are also very limited with worst food quality.  So, it is not ""value for money"" to stay in this hotel.",sourav s,/Profile/souravs565,,30
joshimath1,Our stay at Malari in was amazing with nice location being in the main city and near  ropeway (a short way through ropes to auli )which is a just few metres away from the hotel  Hotel cleanliness is good with cooperative staff which made out stay very comfortable !! Would love to visit again @ Malari inn   ,sumanrana3,/Profile/sumanrana3,,50
joshimath1,"We stayed here for a night. The rooms are just decent(don't expect too hygienic). Staff is polite and helpful. They don't have a kitchen so no food in hotel.However, they are located just near the market with lots of eating out options. Overall a decent stay.",Sbhu,/Profile/Sbhu,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
joshimath1,"The room wasn't clean and neither the bathroom. Although there was provision for enough hot water. They don't even provide wifi. Location : It's on the main road and near the bazaar. So all the eating joints are closeby. It becomes a bit noisy since 4 am because of the travelers leaving for Badrinath. Hence, sleep is disturbed. The view from the room was breathtaking. It rained that day in Joshimath so it looked splendid.",evaarvind14,/Profile/evaarvind14,"New Delhi, India",30
joshimath1,"The room was not clean. The towels given were of poor quality. The floors were dirty too.  It is on the main road and hence a little noisy too. The only good thing about this hotel is its location. For the price paid, it was not worth. If the hotel is cleaned and maintained well, it could be a great place especially during winter when there will be snow in the mountains which could be viewed from the balconies.",Shimna R,/Profile/shimnar,"Bengaluru, India",30
joshimath1,"Location - Infront of Auli Ropeway.   Rooms - We had booked 3 family suites and they were good. Very spacious with sofa sets and centre table. My room on the ground floor had 2 big balconies with majestic views.  Staff - They were very very polite.   Parking - Only 3 cars can be parked.   Cons - They do not have restaurant / kitchen. You can only get tea, coffee or milk there. ",Smrity A,/Profile/smritya2014,"New Delhi, India",40
joshimath1,"clean, well maintained rooms and good service at affordable rates (booked via makemytrip - family suite fr four). great location. awsome views of snow-clad hills around and the town outside, from balcony. a hot-air blower and a cup of morning tea would be a welcome inclusion in the frigid cold weather....",brainchildamit,/Profile/brainchildamit,"New Delhi, India",50
joshimath1,"Best hotel in Joshimath on the main road, 1 minute walking from Auli ropeway counter. Rooms with balcony with mountain view are the USP of this hotel. No Resturent available in the hotel , have to go for food in nearby Marwari hotel or other places just 1 minute walking distance. Budget is good, staff is helpful.",subhasishdey8,/Profile/subhasishdey8,"Kolkata, India",50
joshimath1,It is a budget hotel with great views. The rooms were spacious but the heaters needed to be replaced. The service could have been better. Some of the hotel staff are really helpful. Located at a very convenient position near to the ropeway to Auli.,SuvodipMoitra,/Profile/SuvodipMoitra,"Hyderabad, India",40
joshimath1,"The auli trip was the most adventurous  trip of my life, we reach auli at 11:30 in the night and wasn't able to checked in any of the hotel then came back to joshimath after knocking almost every hotel of joshimath, we reach malari in and it was around 1:30 the reception person opened the gate and we checked in at 2:00 am in joshimath, thanks to the malari in staff, that seems next to impossible in finding a hotel in place like auli or joshimath late in night where almost every hotels shuts at 10. it was a pleasant trip due to malari in",Prabhjeet S,/Profile/157prabhjeets,,50
joshimath1,"Went there in June first week for night halt on our way to Valley of flowers and Hemkunt sahib in Ghagaria. The hotel is very well built with very beautiful rooms (all with bright colours). The rooms and bathrooms were super clean and well maintained. Same with the blankets, pillow covers and bedsheets which was much better compared to our hotel stay in Ukhimath same week. However the best part was the valley and mountain views from the hotel balcony. You can get a site of the whole town as this hotel is located just at the entry of the town. The scenic views were charming enough to just stand there and enjoy the serene beauty of the place. Only drawback was that there is no restaurant in the hotel but it was good for us as we wanted to try different restaurants of our choice",Abhinav A,/Profile/97abhinava,"Navi Mumbai, India",50
joshimath1,"The suite rooms have a fantastic view from the rooms. Nice and furnished rooms. The standard rooms are too average or below average, but clean. No restaurant in the hotel.  Reached and checked in late in the night at 3 am but the staff helped quickly. Stayed only for 6 hours. Overall nice experience .",preetam672,/Profile/preetam672,"Mumbai, India",40
joshimath1,"for a no-frills, (only stay, even food has to be ordered in) hotel the prices are quite steep here, despite a massive discount they offered for bulk booking. however, being new, the rooms & baths are clean, the linen & towels are fresh and the location is good - right next to some great roadside eateries and only a few paces from the auli ropeway, almost bang opposite to the local police station.  the costlier family suite can easily accommodate 4 adults without need for extra bed and is the best room going currently, in terms of value-for-money too. but construction in upper floors is on and not only are they going to have more spacious rooms, but those shall have a much better view of surrounding mountains.   so this may prove a good property in future, but as of now there are",gypsy23097,/Profile/gypsy23097,"Ko Samui, Thailand",30
joshimath1,"We were transferred to this hotel, by the hotel where we had done our booking. Our first impression was not good. The colours on the walls were overwhelming, orange, purple. Honestly, who chooses these kind of colours? There was no hot water, as the geyser was not working. To his credit, the manager did get it fixed, and soon there was hot water. But, its extremely irritating to have to wait, while the electrician works, when all you want to do is rest. They do not have a restaurant, so everthing is room service, from the nearby restaurant. That didn't go well with us either. The staff are confused as to how to treat a guest.  Definitely not guest friendly.",Aparna Viswanathan,/Profile/apuvish,"Bengaluru, India",30
