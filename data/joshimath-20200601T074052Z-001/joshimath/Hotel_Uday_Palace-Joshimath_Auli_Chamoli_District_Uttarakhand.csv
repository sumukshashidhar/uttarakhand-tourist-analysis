joshimath1,"Good Stay at Uday Josimath, My self Ansar AK Pathan travel agent from Dewas Madhya Pradesh, Last month we have a college group to Uttrakhand and we booked Hotel Uday Palace for 2 night. Our stay is very good at hotel. Its located in Josimath which 16 km from Auli, You can enjoy local market & shops near by km from hotel. Narsingh temple is just back side of the hotel. If we talk about hotel its good budget hotel (we paid Rs.3600 per room for off season for 3 adults API). Rooms are renovated and we can accommodate 3 persons easily, hot water is available 24x7. Hotel manager is good person and doing his job well. Meals are up to mark but can be improved. Over all a calm stay at Josimath.
