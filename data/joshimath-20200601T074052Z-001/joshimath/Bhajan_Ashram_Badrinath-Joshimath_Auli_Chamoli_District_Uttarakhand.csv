joshimath2,"We had booked 4 family rooms in ""Standard Room in Badrinath"" very well in advance.  However, just before 1 month from our visit, they had increased the rate THRICE of what we booked.  Hence we had no option but to see for an alternative.  Luckily we got rooms at Bhajan Ashram in our proposed budget.  However, the rooms are basic only with double bed & blankets.  Common toilet was there outside the room.  There is NO bathroom for our category of rooms.  There are some rooms with attached toilet/bathroom, but the rates were high.  We had requested for hot water and they provided 2 buckets of warm (not hot) water at Rs. 100/-.",Manee997,/Profile/Manee997,"Mumbai, India",30
