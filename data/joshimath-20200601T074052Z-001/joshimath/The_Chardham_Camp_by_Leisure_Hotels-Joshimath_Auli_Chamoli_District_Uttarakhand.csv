joshimath1,A great location and the tents have everything you need though it is very basic. It is reasonably clean for an outdoor experience. The infrastructure is not like a hotel. The staff were very helpful and provided good service. The food was awful -  a real let down and something the resort needs to urgently sort out.,Navtej G,/Profile/NavtejG,"Southampton, United Kingdom",30
joshimath1,"We found the stay in The Chardham Camp very satisfying. The approach to the entrance of the camp is a bit clumsy and the rains added to the discomfort but once inside the property, it was a wonderful and different experience staying in a tent. The manager of the property, Mr. Nandan and his team provided excellent comfort and service. The food was excellent; all in all, a wonderful experience. During our trip, we had stayed at Rishikesh, Joshimath and Auli and we found our stay at The Chardham Camp to be the best. Would strongly recommend for interested travellers",Narayan L,/Profile/135narayanl,,50
joshimath1,"We stayed 2 nights, on way to Ghangaria (Valley of flowers and Hemkund Sahib) 1 night and on our return 1 night. We were extremely pleased with the services of Nandanji and his team. Very well maintained tent, clean washroom, great food. Nandanji is extremely guest friendly, he even accompanied us to Adi Shankarar cave, Sri Narasing temple. I would recommend travellers visiting Joshimath should stay at the camps",Bhagini,/Profile/Bhagini,"Chennai, India",50

joshimath1,"It's a tent site and you feel amazing with the location. It gives you warmth once you are there at reception and meeting the manager Nandan!  he will be escorting you personally and explaining about location and surroundings. Welcome drink, Luggage service, and food were amazing, the team is right there to help you every time with a smile. perfect location overlooking to mountain and cloud.  keep it up!",S_K,/Profile/SKala87,"Rishikesh, India",50
joshimath1,We were a group of 4 ladies and stayed there for 2 nights for our Badrinath trip. The tents are very comfortable and the surroundings are very scenic with view of mountains and waterfalls. The camp also has a lot of greenery and adds to the joy of living with nature. The staff is extremely hospitable and very prompt service with a smile. It does not have running hot water but staff gets its in bucket whenever you want it. The food is simple like home cooked and very tasty. The pollution free environment makes you feel very upbeat and relaxed. We really enjoyed our stay and the hospitality and will stay there again if go to Joshimath. Running hot water would have made the stay absolutely perfect but thats a small price to pay for all the other comforts and ambience.,PSinha2402,/Profile/PSinha2402,"Noida, India",40
joshimath1,manager at chardham camp Mr. Nandan Negi is very hospitable...we were breifed about everything in detail..he has map n chart in his office with all details.he guided us on route to be taken and that helped us to visit maximum places in short time...food was good..tents were ok...the beds n towels etc needs to be well maintained....services were very good ..and yes hot water not available in taps but supplied in buckets...but services were quick....early morning 3 a.m. also they would give hot water buckets as many as  required without any reminder...so precisely the quality of services and the hospitality of Mr. Negi surpasses the conditions of upholstery..so just a suggestion to change current upholstery...would definitely love to visit again ---Meera Ganatra  Mumbai,meeraganatra,/Profile/meeraganatra,"Mumbai, India",40
joshimath1,"The Chardham Camp at Joshimath is also a Leisure Hotel property, and my 4th stay in one during my trip to Chota Char Dham in June 2017. This camp was my base for the Badrinath Dham. The camp was neither as picturesque or green as the ones in Harsil and Guptakashi and the tents were also in very close proximity. Sounds carried from one tent to the other. The tents were decent, with functional bathrooms, but the beds sagged and were uncomfortable. The bed linen was also not very clean. Once again, as in all Leisure Hotel camps, their staff is their star feature - warm, welcoming, hospitable and extremely gracious. The food was excellent as well. I'd like to make a special mention of Mr. Nandan Negi, the camp in charge who went out of his way to take care of us. He graciously",ANJUGOELA,/Profile/ANJUGOELA,MUMBAI,40
joshimath1,"This is a unique experience to stay in a nice tent, The tents are nice ,clean and comfortable with attached washrooms, the place itself is perched upon a very scenic background an approchable from the market, The place mainly caters for chardham yatris but you can stay there even if you are not one of the (like we were), Food is great and the management is most helpful.  Over all it was a homely experience there",aditya2603,/Profile/aditya2603,"Dombivli, India",40
joshimath1,"We stayed here for 2 nights. Overall this was an awesome camp stay with delicious homely foods served. Even in the month of Dec-Jan, they had prepared the camps in such a way that you wouldn't feel cold inside the blankets. There is an awesome mountain view from all camps. Mr. Nandan, the caretaker is a very sweet person and always ready to help; be it sight seeing, preparing snacks, hot water, etc. The staff is very friendly. They even do a bonfire on request for no extra charge.  This would be my place of stay if I ever visit again.",Varitant G,/Profile/varitantg,"Ann Arbor, Michigan",40
joshimath1,"People staying in busy areas should find the place best for relaxing and enjoying holiday. holy trip at this property makes a perfect combination of spirituality, relaxation and enjoyment. the staff is cooperative helping in all possible manner, the food served is also good making the stay awesome. the manager Mr. Nand helped and guided us to his best applause of appreciation.",Ravilakhi,/Profile/Ravilakhi,"Hyderabad, India",50
joshimath1,"Visited Joshimath on Sept 25th, 2016 and had a great experience.  The service was par excellence, especially by Mr. Nandan Singh Negi - Camp Executive.  Highly recommend staying at this tent hotel - the food was also delicious and fresh !  Clean and comfortable accommodations.",Semicurious,/Profile/Semicurious,"Saratoga, California",50
joshimath1,This was a last minute stop since Badrinath roads were bad and we wanted a decent place overlooking the hills. This one took us by surprise. All rooms are in form of tents and if you are looking for luxury..go somewhere else. If you are looking for a clean accommodation with all basic stuff and fantastic service and homely food look no further. Views are awesome! Hot water will be supplied by staff on demand. I liked this place since this was a change. The manager is very friendly.,Pavan Punaroor,/Profile/pavanp243,"Bengaluru, India",40
joshimath1,Joshimath camp is on an incline and so requires a steep climb up and down which is not convenient for elderly. Camp is right next to the main road and so is noisy/dusty. Cleanliness was the worst among all chardham camps we stayed during chardham yatra. Blankets had stains and bed sheets were visibly dirty. We had to complain to get them changed. Bathrooms are not well ventilated and so were smelly. Similar to other chardham camps getting bucketed hot water in the morning was an issue. Food was not good as well.  We stayed here for two nights as per Chardham yatra package from leisure hotels. This is the same package offered on makemytrip (as per camp manager). Badrinath being most visited there are much better hotels in Joshimath. Chardham camps and their yatra package is not a,Srinidhi H,/Profile/SrinidhiH3,,10
joshimath1,"We visited this property in the last week of May 2016 while visiting Badrinathji... Spent two nights... Had a great experience... The staff is very friendly and responsible, eager to help with a smile. The camps are very close to the Auli Ropeway and so we went there for couples of hours after the Darshan. The only downside is that the camps are old and are in dire need of renovation. A Big Thank you to Mr. Nandan Negi, the camp manager for the great hospitality.",Mridul G,/Profile/mgoyal,,30
joshimath1,"We stayed here during the last leg of our chardham package tour in May 2016 to visit Badrinath. The manager / person-in-charge, Mr. Nandan Negi welcomed us with a smile and drink, made from local Buransh or Rhododendendron flowers, which was really soothing. He was polite, knowledgeable and briefed us on the places to visit in and around Badrinath and Joshimath, such as Mana Village, Auli, Narsing temple, Shakaracharya Math, etc . He also guided us for the darshan at Badrinath temple. About the camp, the tents were big enough, quite clean, dimly lit. Staff were friendly and helpful, but without uniform - appeared to be not well paid. Food was veg and quite good. Our tent had a view of mountains in the shape of an elephant and a sleeping beauty, as per the local people. Only",Santu18,/Profile/Santu18,"Mumbai, India",40

joshimath1,"Me and my parents frm Guptakashi went to Joshimath,  we found the staff very helpful and nice homely food. Best part is the view u get outside and the flowers around makes you feel so close to nature.  We were lil bit worried before going there as we had never stayed before in camp but as its luxury camp they have fan inside it and basically looked lyk weather proof.  Overall very nice experience,  nice break to the people who want to get out of city n want to be close to nature.  Lovely experience.   Thankyou",sang86,/Profile/sang86,,40
joshimath1,"I was about to leave for Badrinath in the morning when the staff at the hotel informed me about the jams and some landslides en route to Badrinath. Fortunately I didn't leave and the flash flood rocked UK the same day. I had to stay there for like 4 days before the roads where cleared and opened for civilian traffic. I had a time of my lifetime during those four days. Nice quiet place, great for introspection, brilliant staff, and delicious vegetarian food. Best place to stay in Joshimath. Also great view of sleeping lady mountain especially on a moon lit night.",Shrenik311,/Profile/Shrenik311,"Bengaluru, India",40
joshimath1,"We reached this tent towards the end of our trip and we were very tired. The tents are located on a mountain side, right next to the road. So we have to walk down to get to each tent. The further away the tent is from the main road, the less noise there is - but then you are that much further away from the dining hall that is right at the entrance. The tents are basic and clean - and it does get very cold in the night. It is pricey too, but we paid since this whole area lacks any good hotels - the chardham camps atleast assure you that they have the basic hygeine standards covered. There is running hot water in the camps, toilet paper in the toilets, clean sheets etc.",Imrash,/Profile/Imrash,"Austin, Texas",40
joshimath1,"After a long (nearly 10hrs.) drive reached the camp site. First impression of the site good but staff were totally lost. So bad start and things did not improve after that. Checking in was a challenge, took four different staff and a phone call to get formallities done. Good part, walking distance to town so many choices for accomodation and food. Camp site clean, staff needs lots of focus on service. Rest ok and again no hot water, provided on request in the bucket.",Harbinder,/Profile/Harbinder,London,30

joshimath1,"We stayed 1 night at this camp. The camp is located in Joshimath, the base to drive up to Badrinath.  Firstly, the location was very pretty, overlooking the himalayas. They have a lovely sitting area amongst beautiful roses to relax and catch up with TV.   The tents were very comfortable and warm but a little small for a family with kids. They were very clean.   The food was very tasty, healthy and homely. They provide packed breakfast and lunches if required.  The service was excellent. Each member of the staff was very helpful and eager to assist. The manager especially was very exprianced and help us plan our stay very well.  The only downside was that I found it was priced a little on the higher side, but considering the operations are on only a few months in a year, it",MadhaviC,/Profile/MadhaviC,"Bengaluru, India",40
