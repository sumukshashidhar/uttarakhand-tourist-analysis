joshimath,Firstly We though it to be a resort but landed up disappointed as it a mid range hotel. had we not though it to be resort we could have been satisfied probably. secondly we went by the reviews on TA which again confused and elevated our expectations. Now let us come to hotel. It is mid range small hotel which is clean and well maintained.bathrooms were clean as well. view from the balcony is good as well. Please note this is not valley facing but on the other side of road. Food was very tasty. Overall a nice mid range hotel.,ravinderkumar7,/Profile/ravinderkumar7,"New Delhi, India",30

joshimath,"The best place to stay in at and around Kausani. The thing that takes a back seat in kausani is the food but thankfully the heritage resort shines here. Such well cooked food , coupled with amazing ambiance and breathing view of the himalayan range makes it a no brainer to go here. They arrange tours to the nearby wool factory and tea gardens too. The staff is extremely courteous, so courteous that you almost feel that you don't deserve it. They arranged a chalia ( traditional kumaoni) dance , live music and a bonfire too, which enriched the experience even further. Do make sure you try their madue ke aate ka halwa, you'll fall in love with it. They have a play area too where you have Table tennis, carrom , chess. There's a mountain on the left of the resort.

Right from the time of booking Mr. Nandan Singh, the General Manager of the hotel supported me at every step. He and his crew made my stay absolutely pleasant and comfortable. The services provided at the resort were par excellence. Each and every team member at the resort were so courteous and helpful that for a moment it did not seem to me that I am so far away from home traveling on my own. The resort is below a hill and very well located. You can see the himalayas right from your balcony (provided you be there at the right season).

The manager was very courteous and was himself engaged in helping me and other families with different trivial things. There is a nice garden right below the cottages - the view is just mesmerizing. There is also an area for bonfire and a barbecue zone. You can play badminton in the garden as well. There are some seats and a swing on the patio near garden.

We reached at 11 pm and found the entire staff waiting for us at the hotel entrance.They made sure that our check-in was smooth and the food was ready to be served in the restaurant even if it was past their kitchen closing hours. They even gave us an upgrade for 3 rooms without any commercial impact. The view of sunrise from the rooms is breathtaking.   Buffet breakfast had many options and food quality was excellent.

The hotel is isolated from the main town of Kausani, which makes you feel you have landed in the middle of nowhere, surrounded with beautiful views all around! Their executive rooms are very comfortable, with a lovely view and balcony to sprawl in. The entire staff, especially the GM, were most helpful and attentive to our smallest requests. The food was delicious too; just one complaint that, on the whole, the food seemed overpriced.

joshimath,"We visited this place in June and I truly wish we had never heard of it. It was one of the most disappointing travel experiences for all of us.    1. The name in itself is deceptive, it cannot be called a resort. At best this is a small and dingy property practically sitting ON the main road. Looking for some peace, quiet and relaxation? Keep looking, with the constant background din of passing traffic  2. We were a group of 4 couples, and had booked together and well in advance. However we were allotted rooms in 3 separate locations. Why??? This could have easily been avoided with a little planning on the management's part  4. One of our rooms was bang next to the kitchen.

joshimath,PROS:The Heritage Resort provides a lovely unhindered view of the Himalayas. Some of us were alloted the cottage series of 200 which had a cute personal lawn of its own. Here we generally had our open air dinners. This opened up to a larger lawn. The resort provides for outdoor sport facilities like badminton and table tennis. In the evening a bonfire is made and the area throbs to the tunes of latest Punjabi beats.  CONS:We ourselves were alotted room#201 which was one of the worst being infested with flies from the neighbouring breakfast area. The adjoining kitchen created a mindblowing din. Best to specifically avoid this room.Eventually we had to upgrade to the 300 series rooms.  Back to PROS: The 300 series is a level up and provides a beautiful view.

Since, it was off-season, we were offered choice of rooms. Dinner(which is usually in the package), was prepared as per our wish.

The place has a stone facade which gives it a semblance of an authentic Kumaoni structure, but the resemblance ends there. We were given 2 of the best rooms (301 and 302), which afford the best views and have private balconies. Unfortunately, these rooms were ill-equipped to handle the rains. The roofs leaked in both rooms, the floor (made of thin ply) seeped water from below when we stepped on it and we were provided with no mops or even dry floor mats to wipe our feet on.
