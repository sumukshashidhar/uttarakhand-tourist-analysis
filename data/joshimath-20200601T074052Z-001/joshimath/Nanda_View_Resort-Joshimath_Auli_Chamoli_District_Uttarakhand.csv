joshimath1,"The people there were so homely, the food were made as per our choice. View from the camps were so mesmerizing that we didn't wanted to come back.  I am glad that we choose this for our stay in Auli.  One must experience this place.  ",bhumika_D,/Profile/bhumikad02,,50
joshimath1,The resort is understaffed. No water supply in the cottages when it snows they dont make an effort also to make it work. . Request for water (for basic needs) have to be done through phone and then it is provided in buckets and that too just 3. The rooms are very dirty.  GMVN has spent good amount of money to build the new resort but maintenance is pathetic. Avoid it in winters.,Rohit N,/Profile/RohitN457,,20
