joshimath1,"The hotel is situated just 350 mtrs from the Temple and it is best hotel in the vicinity, the rooms are warm but without any heating equipment's. The food is lip smacking and service is also fast. The rate of the hotel might pinch you a bit but the altitude at which this government operated hotel is situated is commendable. The geysers are available 24X7, so no dearth of hot water in your rooms. Also parking space is ample for the all the members staying at the hotel.",Vikymania,/Profile/Vikymania,"Sahibabad, India",50
joshimath1,"Although I spent only one night in TRH badrinath but GMVN do their best for customer satisfaction. We booked 2 deluxe rooms which were bit costly but worth it. The building's interiors matches with the buildings of colonial era may be because building was an old construction. But no doubt it is very well maintained from all aspects, be it cleanliness or paint or bedding  or furniture, everything is fine. Considering the location's accessibility and the area they have maintain versus the number of guests that can stay, I think the room rentals are justified. Ample of parking space. They don't provide room heaters reason being all of the hotel's electricity is generated from solar power and it is difficult to provide geysers and room heaters both in all rooms.",Chetan Sharma,/Profile/chetansharma123,"Chandigarh, India",50

joshimath1,"You cannot get a more secure and decent place to stay in badrinath than this rest house. Its value for money, conveniently located , clean and has a big parking space. What more can a pilgrim want? To add to it the cook is excellent there serving you good food.",Shubhranil D,/Profile/ShubhranilD2,"New Delhi, India",50
joshimath1,Stayed here as part of chardham yatra in the month of April so weather was pleasant.  Conveniently located near main Temple complex with spacious rooms & bathrooms. Interior seems bit worn out may be due heavy rush & harsh weather.  Bed and linen was clean. You need room heaters round the year. Restaurant serves piping hot food with limited timings and menu.  Staff was friendly and courteous most of them will try to help you to their level best if required.  Tariffs seems quite reasonable in town.,Manandani,/Profile/Manandani,"Mumbai, India",40
joshimath1,During Badrinath Visit we stayed here. Badrinath Temple is around 300 m from this place. Hotel is comfortable and offers scenic view specailly at sunrise. Temple is visible from the Hotel. Food is also good however it is prepared on order.,guptaashok_0511,/Profile/guptaashok_0511,"Noida, India",50
