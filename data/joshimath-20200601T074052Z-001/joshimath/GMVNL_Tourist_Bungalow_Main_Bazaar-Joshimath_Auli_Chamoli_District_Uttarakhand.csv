joshimath1,I would like to recommend GMVN for anyone staying in Uttrakhand on pilgrimage. Hotel in joshimath is near Adi sankaracharya ashram and one could feel the energy there. The hotel manager Sushil is very kind and excellent individual who had helped me to book other hotels enroute my spiritual journey to kedarnath. Highly recommend this place . God bless and look forward to my next visit . Keep doing the great work everyone .,Balagi C,/Profile/balagic,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",50
joshimath1,"the restraunt guys are wonderful and service oriented.. But , again , you need toorder 45 minutes before you want to eat!! The geyser should not be on for  a long time!! else you need hotel guys to fix it back. the contact no is 9568006668. you  can call this no to confirm your booking. you can visit both Adi sankaracharya  mutt( through back door in hotel complex) and Narasingh temple( divya desam no 105)",sarangarajan t,/Profile/sarangarajant,,40

joshimath1,"I visited this place around 16th of May with my friend Ravi during our Satopanth Trek... I usually visit this place during my various trips to the Himalayas and stayed here few years back too.... The plus point it is located at the very center of town from where one can go an easy walk to Shankaracharaya temple and cave, Narsingh temple and to the Highest and longest cable car......  Beautifully renovated the old rooms and of course a homely restaurant with some nice texture finishing... Very cordial and helpful kitchen staff,food quality is simple but very good with taste and give you a homely feel.... the guy at the Reception Mr. Vijay is very nice and helpful Guy.. Always ready to listen you and ready to sort out if there are small issues...  Economy rooms are true justice to",Dinesh U,/Profile/248dineshu,,50
joshimath1,"We got only Economy rooms in the ground floor. But, it was more than enough and rooms and bathroom were very neat & clean. Front office staff were very polite and cordial. Restaurant is too small, to accommodate only 4 small groups at a time. So, we need to order our food beforehand and once ready you would be called for dining room. Main advantage of this hotel, is, it is in the main bazaar. parking facility is available. There is another GMVNL in Joshimutt, which is in outskirts. Blankets were good enough for September chillness and hot water was available",SriniThiru,/Profile/SriniThiru,"Chennai, India",40
joshimath1,"Forget the old rooms as TRH (main bazaar) joshimath is now newly constructed with all the facilities, classy clean rooms, beautiful washrooms, clean walls and sheets, hot water, friendly staff (starting at Rs.990/-). On the main bazaar with good food options as well. The only thing missing is the view. Rest is value for money.  Note: Book dorms if you like it (if in a group). Its dirt cheap, beautifully cleaned with locker facility and well maintained as well. Only 8 beds.",HOMPRS,/Profile/HOMPRS,"New Delhi, India",40
joshimath1,"Stayed here in the month of April was with family members. This stay offers good option in joshimath town which do not have many better option than this one. Location is a plus point due proximity to bus depots, taxi stand and markets.  Coming to property it is a basic guest house kind option mainly used by tourist as stop over in char dham pilgrimage. Rooms-bathrooms are basic & modest in terms of size + cleanliness.  Since they get occupancy not round the year and weather is harsh half of the year you can expect this sort of things. Bed & linen are okayish type.  Staff is friendly but services are at god's mercy.  They have got attached restaurant which offers fresh / hot / delicious meals at reasonable prices.  Tariffs are in range of Rs. 1000-1500 depending upon season and",Manandani,/Profile/Manandani,"Mumbai, India",30
joshimath1,"Good things about this hotel is good & helpful staff,economical food prices & proximity to main bazaar & bus stand. We stayed in this hotel as we had plans for skiing in Auli next day. Rooms are ok & not well maintained, offers modest accommodation.Choose a better place if its available, nevertheless happy with its service. Travelled with friends in Nov-Dec 2016.",jatinsmehta,/Profile/jatinsmehta,"Mumbai, India",30
joshimath1,"It is a modest accommodation but never the less quite cheap and easy in access. We continue to be happy with their service :) Hotel is in the middle of the main market, walking distance from main bus and taxi stand  Staff is very good. Food is average. Rooms are ok and can get other hotels in main market which are far better in quality and that too in the same price.",Nirmit S,/Profile/NirmitS15,,30
joshimath1,"Good Thing about the property: In the middle of the main market, 1-2 mins walking distance from main bus and taxi stand  Staff is very good and helpful.  Food is at very low price and good as well  Bad points: Rooms are not well maintained We have other hotels in main market which are far better in quality and that too in the same price",Deepak P,/Profile/116deepakp,Mumbai,30
joshimath1,"Hi, So post our treks in and around chandrashilla, we came to Joshimath to spend the night. As always, we never looked beyond GMVN Main bazaar because it is right in the main square.  We had plans to visit Auli next day for skiing but learnt there was hardly any snowfall then. We had dinner (which was quite good) and slept comfy for the night.  It is a modest accommodation but never the less quite cheap and easy in access. I continue to be happy with their service :)  Cheers! Prashant",Prashant S,/Profile/prashant_menon,"Mumbai, India",40
joshimath1,we stayed in the super deluxe rooms costing almost 1500/night The bed sheets were dusty..white sheet was almost blue and torn food was pathetic! we had only 1 meal there and then ventured out to better places around. there was only 1 staff it seemed who was hardly willing to do much. I advise staying in gmvn auli compared to joshimath standards,shivi6,/Profile/shivi6,"Bengaluru, India",30
joshimath1,"We stayed here on the last night of the Auli trip, since we had to catch Bus as early as 04:30 morning next day for Rishikesh/Haridwar.  We asked for extra heater since the room had none, as we expected the temperature to plummet at night but the manager assured it wont be as cold as Auli and the blankets would suffice. Still he said he will try for the heater, but we didnt pursue it any further.  The guest house room has no luxuries and represents perfect B&B. It provides a very good bed and blanket and the geyser provided hot water as expected. We spent the night in the TRH and caught the bus in the morning and have no qualms regarding the service or quality.  The Guest house is very close to the Bazaar, just a few paces. The morning buses for Dehradun and Haridwar start just",Prashant S,/Profile/prashant_menon,"Mumbai, India",40
joshimath1,Nice little hotel in the middle of the bazaar but surprisingly very clean and in fact you get tea/coffee maker in the room. This is nice hotel with easy accessibility to the major places in Joshimath. The food is good and staff was helpful and willing to fullfil the requirements. This is a good break for the people travelling to Badrinath as you can start early morning from the hotel and reach Badrinath quite quickly.,AmitKishore,/Profile/AmitKishore,"New Delhi, India",30
joshimath1,"We stayed in the new GMVN tourist lodge mid November '10 - this is a budget hotel run by the Uttarakhand (state) government. It is clean - the rooms we got had balconies opening out to a great view of the mountains. Don't expect colour coordinated linen and curtains or a heater - it's a basic hotel. The people at the reception are very helpful - we had to get to Auli - they arranged for good drivers to get us there and back since the cable car was not working.  The food was okay - not a five star hotel but adequate enough and the room service was prompt and friendly. If you know Hindi, you'll find people willing to tell you the folklore about the many rivers and mountains in the area -  fascinating.  The only downside is that you have to climb a bit from the main road - so any",mitra169,/Profile/mitra169,Mumbai,40
joshimath1,"We stayed there on the way to Auli. The rooms in the new block are good. They open out to the street , but also give a very good view of the mountains. It is bang in the middle of the market place , so one can also explore that area. It is close to where the State transport bus drops you. The food in the mess is hot and regular, like dal-chawal and breakfast items.  The rates  are very reasonable and one dosen't feel ripped off.  Hot water is available the entire day.",ritiroybetai,/Profile/ritiroybetai,Pune,30
