joshimath1,I would like to recommend GMVN for anyone staying in Uttrakhand on pilgrimage. Hotel in joshimath is near Adi sankaracharya ashram and one could feel the energy there. The hotel manager Sushil is very kind and excellent individual who had helped me to book other hotels enroute my spiritual journey to kedarnath. Highly recommend this place . God bless and look forward to my next visit . Keep doing the great work everyone .,Balagi C,/Profile/balagic,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",50
