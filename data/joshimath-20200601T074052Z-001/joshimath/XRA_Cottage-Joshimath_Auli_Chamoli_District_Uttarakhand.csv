joshimath1,"very bad experience  for stay hear , Very disgusting hotel. Very bad services. Water supply is poor. No hot water available. and food not  healthy and tasty. Kitchen is not maintained. Management doesn't cares it's customers. If you to plan to stay there, face the problem yourself.",Madhu,/Profile/1madhu2,,10
joshimath1,The manager or the owner is very bad and disrespectful... Cottages are not good at all.. No room service.. There is no water at the morning. There heater is broken and very cold. Not freindly behaviour from the hotel Members..,swarnankur d,/Profile/swarnankurd,,10
joshimath1,Such a great place to stay with mesmerising Himalayan views. Rooms were neat & Clean with good views. This place supports sports activities too. owner was a great host . Definitely visiting them again.,Arvind S,/Profile/Anushaarvind,"Chennai, India",50
joshimath1,"I stayed at xra during low season and I am so greatful. The host was very kind and helped out with any instructions I needed, we had good conversations and I even extended my stay because the views and the cottage itsself are stunning. I also had the cutest dog guide on my hike to Auli. The calmness and fresh air of the village and friendly people also added extra value to the visit. For me the food was nice, homemade and simple. I wish you all the best and hope to visit again!  Jas.",Jasmina C,/Profile/501jasminac,,50
joshimath1,I stayed there with my family in 2 alpine cottages. Rooms were clean and equipped with very basic amenities. The location is also nice as mountains are visible from the window and there is small garden in front of the cottage.  Their food menu is very basic and not so much varieties to order. But It was nice to eat homely food for a single night.,sourav s,/Profile/souravs565,,30
joshimath1,"The cottages is so lovely to stay in because of the hospitality, good quality of food, clean rooms and never the less, lovely location. I really want to thank to their staff for the lovely services. I really had a lovely time there with my family.",Amit Bhatt,/Profile/mtbhatt44,"New Delhi, India",50
joshimath1,"I booked 3 rooms from MMT and 1 room from their website for 2 days . Food quality and even tea , coffee was taste less .  The pricing of  dinner is  290 Rs. per person but the food quality that they provide was less then 50 Rs .Heater and geyser were not working in even single room , the temperature was less then -5 , on that situation also they didn't provide hot water in sufficient quantity.  I never saw such uncooperative and rude hotel staff . I already booked this hotel at pricing 15K approx and you can't imagine that I paid 14,415 Rs at hotel also for just food and tea .( exclude 5000 for skiing ) .That is so much costly . I hope you will think once again before booking this hotel .",Chetan Dhakar,/Profile/132chetand,,10
joshimath1,"The main attraction for me of choosing XRA was its location and beautiful pictures posted online. The location was just average and the online pictures are misleading. Usually, the hospitality is great at such places but experienced the worst here. On exploring, we came across much better places with even better views. The food was very costly and not worth that much cost. Dinner costed Rs290 per person which had very very basic and not at all tasty food. After having one meal there, we didn't have another one.The rooms are not even close to what they appear in pictures. It was neither a pleasant nor a comfortable stay. Improper space/place for parking. I wish the owner all the best with its improvements.",Kanika G,/Profile/knomadicv,"New Delhi, India",30
joshimath1,The cottages were booked so we could only get the home stay. At INR 1000 the accommodation was OK but the hospitality was great. The location for home stay is a little   tough ask as you need to climb down some stairs. But the location of home stay is amazing in terms of the view. You open the door to see hills right in front of you. In two days we 3 ppl had around 19 cups of tea as it was cold but the arrangements were good.,SenShiven,/Profile/SenShiven,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
joshimath1,It is terrible and pathetic like a home stay far far different than as projected in the review and website . The host is very rude and lacks mannerism to talk to ladies . We had cancel our stay here after seeing the cottages and the advance payment is also not refunded .   Very very bad experience,Pradeep T,/Profile/167pradeept,"Bengaluru (Bangalore), India",10
joshimath1,"We had a wonderful experience at XRA. the host is warm, very knowledgeable. The food was lovely.   Its an absolute delight,  close to the nature and really serene.  Though I would have really loved it if the bed was more comfortable and was a double bed than twin beds joined together with gaps in between.",Parul B,/Profile/878parulb,"New Delhi, India",40
joshimath1,"The heart and the soul where definitely in a much better place after visiting.  The cottages are awesome, the amenities are very clean and new.  Solar hot water heater was just installed.  The food was quality homemade Northern Indian.    The place is family owned.  The family is awesome and very welcoming.  Vivek is definitely a local expert (anything outside) and full of knowledge and insight to the area.  Awesome people and I will definitely coming back.    The location is not bad, a bit if a walk from the town (30 min if you are moderately fit, I took a couple breaks).  The town is killer and the people are very friendly.

joshimath1,"We stayed at XRA Cottage as part of the 5 day trek to Kuari Pass and Pangharchulla peak, arranged with XRA. The owner of XRA is himself a professional skier, and snowboarded, and a good host. We stayed at the relatively newer cottages - nice cosy rooms with different kind of decor. Bathroom is a bit of irritant (hot water is slow, washbasin outlet is bit messy) but still better than average I would say. The highlight is the french windows in the rooms and the small garden from where you get a beautiful panoramic view of the upper Himalayas. We used to just sit there for hours in early morning, soaking in the views and gentle morning sunlight, having tea and snacks. Dining area is also very nice and food is good. The trekking was another great experience, but about that I will",Skydats,/Profile/Skydats,"Bengaluru, India",50
joshimath1,I simply love this place.  Have been there twice and would certainly go back again.  The rooms are very clean with running hot water (a must in these mountains) and have large windows with panoramic view of mighty Himalayas.  The food is excellent. The eastern side of dinning room has large windows and offers a breath taking view of show clad mountains.  The owner Mr. Vivek and his staff took very good care of us.  XRA cottage is an excellent place to stay whether you are in the mountains for skiing or trekking.  Mr. Vivek is a pro in both areas and helped us get the maximum out of our trekking trip. Thank you and see you soon......!,srenge,/Profile/srenge,"Saitama Prefecture, Japan",50
joshimath1,"I don't normally write reviews, but X R A's outstanding services & great hospitality  forced me to write the one for X R A Cottages. The Property is Adorable, Calm and Filled with the vibrant colors of Nature. Breathtaking Views of the snow peaked mountains right from the windows just stole my heart away. The place is so nice that it certainly became my ""Home"" in Joshimath - Auli. If Planning a Trip to Auli - Joshimath then your search for an accommodation ends here. Highly Recommended !",Sumityash,/Profile/Sumityash,"New Delhi, India",50
joshimath1,"Enthusiastic and passionate team led by Vivek, very nice and comfortable room with excellent food. At XRA you need not to worry about anything. All the solution under one roof that is XRA Cottage.  If i ever came back, i will prefer XRA over any five star hotel. Its a homely feeling at XRA Cottage.",Xeestudios,/Profile/Xeestudios,"New Delhi, India",50

joshimath1,"this amazing place is 7kms after joshimath as you drive towards auli, about midway to auli.the place is beautiful with amazing views and absolutely peaceful.very few houses around. the best part of the homely place is the lawn with amazing flowers and birds flocking in n out all the time.its not a typical hotel.its managed by a vivek who is a great man and takes personal care. rooms are simple yet aesthetically done.the glassy dining area is a great hang out place.the food is very very tasty.food does take time though,but as i said its not a typical hotel. i loved it. thank you vivek for the hospitality.",dwaipayandas,/Profile/dwaipayandas,"Kolkata, India",50
joshimath1,"Auli has so far been my best trip in North India. One of the major contributing factors was the stay. We stayed in XRA cottages. They are located 17 kms from joshimath. Just 7 kms away from Auli and the skiing point, and with 180 degrees view of snow clad mountains, you cannot get better than this. They are reasonably priced, food is really good, people are amazing. The owner Vivek Panwar was very cooperative. We got the best skiing training from him and his team. Everyone in the resort made sure that we were comfortable in the cold weather and conditions. If you want to make best out of the trip, choose the place to stay wisely. And XRA should top your list. It's a one point solution to skiing snowboarding trekking and such activities. Plus, good food. What else can you ask for!",nehathakkar14,/Profile/nehathakkar14,"Mumbai, India",40
joshimath1,"I went to stay at Xtreme cottage during the winter season and was really glad I made that choice. Vivek and his family were very friendly, caring and their service was highly excellent. All the rooms were spick-and-span and pretty large with lots of space to oneself. Since it was winter, I appreciated the utilities (kettle, heater, hot shower) in my room which made my stay warmer (literally) and more convenient. Their family also cooked local traditional meals which made my stay there even more ""local"".   Their lovely garden was an awesome place to relax during the afternoons. The time spent there was very peaceful and in addition, their house was facing a majestic breathtaking view of the Himalayas.  I highly recommed this place if you are interested in nature activities,",ilovegarlicnaans,/Profile/ilovegarlicnaans,"Singapore, Singapore",50
