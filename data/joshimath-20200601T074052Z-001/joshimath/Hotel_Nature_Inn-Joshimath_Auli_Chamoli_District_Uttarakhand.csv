joshimath1,we have a wonderful experiece in staying this hotel. The size of the rooms are really large and the staff is really helping and well mannered.  The best part is that the food is made fresh and served at your convience. The taste of the food is just like home.   It seems that you are in your own second home.  The owner is really helpful if you need any guidance or any urgent arrangements to be made.,Honey B,/Profile/honey6862,"Faridabad, India",50

joshimath1,"I had a nightmare kind of experience by booking this hotel, very horrible i booked this hotel for my family after seeing the website all looked fine. my family arrived there at 11 pm late night and within 1 hr we all wanted to leave, there was no water in bathroom, dust was everywhere in room  &   there was  only one man who serves, who picks the phone, who cooks, who cleans everything and every corner of the hotel is dame dirty and very bad food. according to me it looked like a house converted into a hotel. never book this hotel ,,,,,,,,,,,,",Deepika_Dangwal28,/Profile/Deepika_Dangwal28,"Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India",10
