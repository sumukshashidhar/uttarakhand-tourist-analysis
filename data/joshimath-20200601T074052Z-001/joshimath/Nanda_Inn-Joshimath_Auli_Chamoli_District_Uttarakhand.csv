Firstly the hospitality that they give is exceptional. Even if you ask for hot Maggie at mid night when the temperature is negative 7 degree Celsius - they happily serve you. Because it was freezing cold during nights, we asked for extra room heaters which they didn't have but they provided us with a lot of extra warm blankets. There are two guys - Sanjay and Santosh who manage the property and they are very friendly and take care of guests very well.
