joshimath1,This is a government run guest house in Joshimath and has decent facilities. The super deluxe rooms are quite big with attached balconies giving a good view of snow capped mountains. Also these rooms have included heater facilities. For other rooms also they will say that they can provide heaters on extra charge but this strictly depends on availability. So if you are planning a winter trip now you know which room to book! Also a good news for non vegetarians like me....their restaurant menu had non veg options (a thing quite rare in the veg dominated state). However we had some hot water issue in some rooms though we did not put much efforts in resolving it as we stayed just for one night. I would highly recommend this to people looking for a decent stay with proper facilities,Ria1104,/Profile/Ria1104,"Bengaluru, India",40

The rooms are very spacious and the balconies offered great views of snow covered mountains. The food is also great and the eating area was very clean.

joshimath1,"Stayed at GMVN for 3 days between 28-30th April. Both deluxe and economy rooms are good. Hotel has been renovated.  Lovely staff , kind & helpful and was happy to have human touch which is lost in cities. Food in the restaurant is also very good. Loved their pooris in the morning and special made to order poha on one of the days.  Location is right at the main bazaar and quite convenient. Important to add that it is a safe place for families & even solo or women travelers.",Satish K,/Profile/SatishK1554,,50
joshimath1,"Stayed in this hotel during first of week during my travel to Badrinath.This review is on the GMVN in Main Bazaar next to Shankaracharya Mandir.  1. We were allocated with 3 super deluxe rooms in the second floor of this building and the rooms were old and lacked Maintenance.  2. The lobby and Balcony area were dirty and were not mopped. The doors lacked latches.  3. The bed and sleep quality were average and the adjoining buildings were very small,cramped and little dirty.  4.The Dining hall is in the ground floor next to reception and there are only 4 tables capable of catering to 16 people. The food was good and the service was exceptional. Only bright spot in the stay.  5.From the Main Bazaar , the road leading to this specific GMVN has been made one way during yatra period",saikumarnc,/Profile/saikumarnc,Chennai,30
joshimath1,"One of the best places to stay in Joshimath ,which is a gateway to Badrinath and Valley of flowers/ Hemkund Saheb . Rooms and amenities are very good and reasonably priced. Restaurant serves very good food. However lacks good , professional staff . I found the staff at GMVN Tilwara to be the best amongst all GMVNs",Vipin Arora,/Profile/vipina776,"Lucknow, India",40
joshimath1,"Stayed at this place twice during my visits to badrinath.Had booked two rooms ac deluxe and super deluxe.  Pros:- 1.Rooms are spacious. 2. Has an inhouse restaurant, clean and serves good food. 3. Located next to Sankaracharya math. 4. Has proximity to market. 6. Reasonably priced. 7. Excellent staff. 8. Rooms on the front have good view.  However, the rooms along with the furniture and fixtures look old except for those which have been renovated ( Deluxe rooms on the front on the ground floor)  Overall, find this place quite suitable for a transit stay en route to badrinath.

joshimath1,"We stayed for 1 night while returning from Valley of Flowers. The hotel was extremely clean and the room was great - working cable TV, hot water geyser, comfortable bed & spacious room/bathroom. One normally does not expect this quality from a govt. organisation. The dinner at the restaurant was also good. There seems to be a temple in the vicinity and in the morning, one could hear the temple karyakartas hurrying the devotees along the queue. Parking facility available.",Himalay_Wanderer,/Profile/Himalay_Wanderer,Mumbai,40
joshimath1,"On our return trip from Badrinath we stayed at this hotel. Though not much to look at from the outside, you can feel the difference when you get into your room. Of course it is not a star hotel but the room we stayed in was clean and compact. The bed was nicely made up, the toilet had hot and cold running water and very clean. The restaurant on the ground floor served basically veg dishes but also had eggs available if you like. Food was good.  The ESP of the place is it's location. You are right near the market and other facilities. One word of caution - please have cash with you or withdraw from the nearby ATM as we found our cards or digital payment modes not quite entertained at the hotel and the restaurant.  It is within walking distance from the Auli ropeway station not",SomG2014,/Profile/SomG2014,"Kolkata, India",40
joshimath1,"this is one of the best hotels that you can stay at while visiting Auli.  Auli is famous for the sceneries, snow, ropeway and skiing. and all these things are easily available if you stay at this hotel in their backyard. Most of the people plan to stay in Joshimath N plan to visit Auli via cable car or cabs, however staying at this hotel is less expensive as well as the experience is much better because in Joshimath you will not be seeing snow all the time.    The view from our room was amazing. We could see the frozen snow pieces flowing down the ceiling, and in early morning, the view of sun covering the hills is something which one should not miss at all if coming to Auli.  Try getting room numbers on third floor for a better view and a private Balconi for the lobby.   Also",Dishi_Jain,/Profile/Dishi_Jain,"Mumbai, India",40
joshimath1,"We traveled Auli in the month of November with our bullets RE from Haridwar. It was too and fro around 600 Kms. Breathtaking views of the valley and company of beautiful rivers during your whole journey will make your journey delight full.   -About GMVN is an government maintained tourist resort on the top of Auli. You can have beautiful views of the mountains from most of their rooms. As we traveled not in the Peak season so we negotiated for the room and got a night stay in around 1100Rs Although the rooms are Starting from 1600Rs+ But these guys give some offer during off season so thts the advantage. -The basic rooms are outside the main building and its like a porta cabins having all the basic things like heater,water,towels,blankets etc. Best for Bachelors. -We had dinner",Vivek,/Profile/thevivek01,"Haridwar, India",30

joshimath1,"First of all, GMVN is the place to look for stay when you are traveling in Uttaranchal. They are almost at every tourist destinations in the state. You need to book your room at least 3 days prior(website: gmvnl.com)  Now GMVN joshimath(Main Bazar) is in joshimath town and most people there knows this place. So it won't be a difficult task to locate this place once you've joshimath.  We were a group of 12. We booked the dorm and 2 deluxe rooms. I wouldn't say the place was hygienic and well maintained.

joshimath1,"We stayed in GMVN TRH, Joshimath (Main Bazar) in the month of October, 2015 on the way to Badrinath. We booked two Super Deluxe rooms. The rooms were just excellent with individual balconies. I think they had been newly renovated. The food we received was delicious. As we booked Super Deluxe rooms, our breakfast and the tea afterwards were complimentary. The TRH being located in the main market area of Joshimath, it was very convenient going marketing. The Jyotirmath is situated very near the TRH. And the Narsingh Temple is also near the TRH. The entrance to Auli cable car is at a nearby location. The view of the sunrise from the balcony is quite charming. The room service we received was also quite satisfactory. The hotel staff was courteous and helpful.
