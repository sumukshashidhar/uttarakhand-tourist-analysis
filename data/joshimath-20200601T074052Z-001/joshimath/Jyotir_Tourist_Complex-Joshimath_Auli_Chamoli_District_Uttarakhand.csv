joshimath1,"I booked this hotel directly from GMVN CP office without reading much about this hidden gem, this new tourist guest house of GMVN is located centrally in Joshimath with ample car parking space though approach to this hotel is quite steep and narrow for vehicles but manageable. Hotel staff and food is also good, they charged 250 bucks per night for room heater from us which was steep compare to other GMVN's, room service is prompt.  Rooms are large with attached balcony and windows got mountain views.  This place is usually full with tourist activities so i suggest you to book this property well in advance, they can also arrange tourist guide and vehicle for interested travelers.  The famous Auli skiing resort is only 12-13 KM away from this place and tourist cab for to and fro",Anish01,/Profile/Anish01,"New Delhi, India",40
joshimath1,"GMVN Joshimath NEW is located at a height. This gives excellent location advantage to this property. Snow-capped mountains are easily visible from this place. Also the holy spots of Shankaracharya Math and Amar Kalp Vriksha are at a walking distance from this place.  The construction is new and the rooms are spacious. We had taken Super Deluxe Room (Room No. 3) and it contained a double bed, writing table, indoor balcony area with 2 chairs. The room windows and balcony area gave wonderful view of the snow-capped mountains.  Bathroom has modern furnishings and fittings with a good geyser.   Staff was very helpful and courteous and we were very satisfied by the staying arrangements.   However, there is ONE BIG ISSUE - FOOD. The HYGIENE conditions in restaurant are quite bad.
