joshimath2,Stayed here as I arrived late and everything else was closed. I negotiated and found an ok room to stay. Only blankets no heater. Since i had no other option decided to stay overnight. The water from the geyser can be maximum warm. overall i'd recommend GMVN hotels nearby for the same price.,LLO F,/Profile/LLOF1,,30
joshimath2,"The worst experience ever..... Water heater doesn't work..... Mattresses are not in condition..... Staff is rude and lies a lot. ...... I've been talking with the manager about booking some rooms again, he's been telling lies since first contact and now isn't even responding.",Pranav,/Profile/Pranav2112,,10
