joshimath1,Please don't stay here. The rooms stank of stale cigarette smoke. Carpets (why did they even have it) were extremely dirty and torn. Bed linen wasn't clean. Walls were black with dirt. Curtains were super dirty. Bathrooms were barely manageable. Didn't get running hot water - were provided same in dirty buckets. ,IQKaur,/Profile/IQKaur,"Bengaluru, India",10
joshimath1,"We stayed at Hotel Trishul in July 2016. The season was not good and the many hotels had increased tariff, but Hotel Trishul was very reasonable. The hotel is old, but rooms are comfortable and clean. The staff is polite and cooperative. The location is very convenient, close to restaurants and main bazaar.   Interestingly, we had stayed in the same hotel in July 2006 also (10 years back), and were satisfied with the hotel.",Parin P,/Profile/drparin,"Rajkot District, India",40
joshimath1,We stayed there for a night while going to Badrinath. Its situated in the centre of the city and very near to the market area. Not very lavish. Comes in budget. Services are satisfactory. Very Good Value for Money.,Dharmendra S,/Profile/686dharmendras,"New Delhi, India",40
joshimath1,"I stayed there in June 2016. It was quite good stay in the newer part of the hotel. Good value for the money, spacious bathroom with the hot water, good sized comfortable room. Had a good chat with Ramesh the receptionist. Very centrally located with the parking facility.",Sanaya1981,/Profile/Sanaya1981,"New Delhi, India",40
