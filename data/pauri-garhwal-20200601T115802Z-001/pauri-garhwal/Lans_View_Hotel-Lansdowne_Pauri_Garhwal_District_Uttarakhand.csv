pauri-garhwal,"Awesome place to stay, a small hotel but nice and cozy, recommended for family and friends, it doesn't has a restaurant inside but one can always order from outside.  Nice place with economical rates.  And not to forget Mr. Omveer, Manager , a very nice person who will be there to help you in all possible ways.",ashishsingh7271,/Profile/ashishsingh7271,"New Delhi, India",40
pauri-garhwal,A decent hotels to stay with the cost they provide.. As there are very few options available in Landsdowne this is an average hotel for bachelors.. Recommended for its location and value for money.. Please see the rooms first before staying... ,Ranjanfoxtraveller,/Profile/Ranjanfoxtraveller,Delhi,30
pauri-garhwal,I didn't stay here but had a look at the rooms before deciding. The place is a budget home stay and has unventilated rooms with basic amenities. Cleanliness could be better. Stay here if you can bear musty sheets and on a tight budget.,ADS,/Profile/wanderdas,,20
