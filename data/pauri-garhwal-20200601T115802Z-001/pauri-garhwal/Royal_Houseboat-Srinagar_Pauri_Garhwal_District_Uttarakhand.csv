pauri-garhwal,"We received a very nice welcome with their special tea early in the morning. The owner is a true gentleman with great manners who can give you an idea of the life in Kashmir. The boat is perfect for groups. We also joined the tour provided by the boat which was very joyful and well organised. But I think there was a misunderstanding in the booking rules and the only thing I would advise other travelers is fixing the prices so that there are no extra tips to pay to hundreds of people that might be involved in serving you! It was a half board stay and we enjoyed their breakfast, probably the best breakfast we had in India because of their tasty fresh cheese and bread. Also I'd say we really enjoyed the dinner but would have preferred some sides too",shaghayeghkoup,/Profile/shaghayeghkoup,,40
