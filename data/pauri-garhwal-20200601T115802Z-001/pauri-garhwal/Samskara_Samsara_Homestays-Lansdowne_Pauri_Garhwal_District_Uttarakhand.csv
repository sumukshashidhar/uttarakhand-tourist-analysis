pauri-garhwal,"A best place to visit and stay in Lansdowne, I must this was a great experience or absolutely worth a single penny spent. The property is so beautiful and calm that I can't Express in my words and pictures. The most important thing the staff, very hospitable always eager to help you for everything. Saurav, mohit and others, I must the gems of the industry. Thanks Shivani for suggesting a beautiful and comfortable room. The food is awesome you will not get such food on any other hill station. You can actually take your pets with you, which is for me is very important. I must say it is not a home stay. It's a full fledged luxury resort. I will for sure go back again and urge other 100 people to go and stay at this beautiful property. Kudos",Rahul kaushik,/Profile/RahulsKaushik,"Rewari, India",50
pauri-garhwal,"I had an amazing time at this place, though initially there was a problem in even playing music or shouting while playing cricket as they had not informed us that there is a Satsung taking place on the floor above us. They even asked us to look for another place as soon as we came, so that was a put off in the beginning. Though we adjusted accordingly and had a good time, the food was good and they have a huge lawn where we plated cricket and had bonfire in the evening. The most important thing they did for which I would like to compliment them is for their sincerity, I had left my ring in one of their washrooms and they took all the pain to return it via post on time without any hassle. Thanks a lot to the management.",shivagupta1294,/Profile/shivagupta1294,"New Delhi, India",40

pauri-garhwal,"The ONLY good thing about this place is the staff. They take bookings in the middle of the night that too of people who are drunk. I booked it thinking it will be a peaceful place with rules that cater to everyone. sadly, it wasn't so. If you want to complaint, in the middle of the night, you will find only the cook around. The owners don't stay there and have pasted a WhatsApp number on the wall. Good luck calling them with no network and the number not having been saved can't be called through WhatsApp also. As a woman, it made me feel unsafe. The toilets for the tents was right next to my room, the kitchen right behind and abusive drunken men right before my window..it was a horrible melee of constant noises screeching, clanging .,you name it!

pauri-garhwal,"When your travel destination is Lansdowne, Check in for a stay here at the tent. From Kotdwar to Lansdowne, on 34th km you would be crossing this resort. It’s 5 km before Lansdowne. Prefer to stay in tent. They have got 5 tents, which is unique of its kind.  they have also got conventional type rooms and dormitories for group numbering below 10. A stay in tent would be memorable for newly married couple. They serve delicious food. (Both veg and non veg available). But you need to order well in advance. An open lawn with shuttle cock court, a small arrangement for Camp fire, a small fish pond, 3 cute dogs and your loved one around should give a pleasant feeling for you.

pauri-garhwal,"The property seemed to be pretty decent, surrounded by lush green trees, ample space and warmth of homely food. The day one we stayed turned out to be a hell of a day, scary but adventurous. We stayed in the tent, that was more of a private independent  accommodation. It poured heavily, wind blowing and wooshing the whole night, thundering as if the sky is going to fall. Giving me goosebumps and my partner waking up occasionally but slept through out. The next day was quite peaceful, followed by an evening bonfire. During off season the service is bit slow but nonetheless the food was very warm and made from heart :) Overall a nice experience.

The property: It is a beautiful property with a huge open space, bonfire, kitchen and dining, indoor and outdoor games, a good collection of books. Everything that you can ask for. Tents: The property has dorms, rooms, and tents. We stayed in the tents which were very cozy, super clean, had a front and back balcony. No complaints there. Cleanliness: So, here is my grouse. There are five tents sharing two bathrooms and 4 washrooms. The cleanliness was substandard or rather awful. The washrooms and bathrooms were dirty all the time and we had to repeatedly ask the staff to clean them.  That is not the kind of cleanliness you expect for the price you pay.

As it is May, there wasnt much in Lansdowne as it  was all dry. But we enjoyed the stay in Samskara Samsara.  We had booked dormitory beds, were a bit confused about the crowd. Hotel owner was so helpful in clearing our doubts.  The crowd in the hotel was very good, no issues at all in the whole stay. Hotel staff were very friendly and prompt in their service.  You will have to order food atleast 30mins earlier because they need time to prepare. The view from the hotel is awesome. You can enjoy the breeze both at night and morning.

Tents are semi-luxury without toilents.  Beds are super comfy, neat and beautiful   One can find a place at backyard of tents with beanbags and can read, meditate or relax in the nature's lap  Another reason to choose this place is FOOD.

This place is not luxurious but it is one of the best stay in Lansdowne or in India..... reason is the property location, Excellent staff, delicious food, nice ambience, neat and clean rooms and tents and above all the owner of this property or resort.

Cons:  1> At the time of our visit there was no parking available, so the car had to be parked beside the main road only, But the parking was under construction, so this issue might be resolved soon 2> By mistake we selected a room with private toilet. so it was little bit inconvenient (it is not their fault, but be careful while selecting).

He told us that we are welcome to have a meal at the homestay but they would require some time to prepare the meal which was understandable so we waited for a few minutes and slowly the dishes rolled out, the mango shake and cold coffee were first to come and were perfect, then came the maggie which was very tasty and finally the main course which was truly excellent home cooked food.
