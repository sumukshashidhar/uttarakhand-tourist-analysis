pauri-garhwal,Located on the way to Badrinath. Ambience good. For upper floors both stair cases and slope are available. One departmental store is located at the entrance where you can buy all your needs. One draw back is at the entrance to the room there is glass partition covered with screen and no wall is there. Fruits are available nearby at cheaper prices,880desktop,/Profile/880desktop,"Madurai, India",40
pauri-garhwal,It is a nice budgeted hotel in Srikot  which is just 3-4 kms prior to main town Srinagar.  Hotel staff is really friendly and helpful.  Hotel is perfectly suitable for pilgrimage going or returning from the sanctified shrine of Kedarnath and Badrinath ji. Room allocated to us was clean however the linen had some spots on it but staff immediately changed it as soon as we request. Overall ok to stay for one night.,Mannu300,/Profile/Mannu300,"New Delhi, India",30
pauri-garhwal,"After finishing visit of kedarnath, we were back by Helicopter to Guptakashi at 14.oo hrs. and proceeded journey at 15.00 hrs. so it was not possible to reach Haridwar so we decided to stay at Srinagar, 130 km prior to haridwar. The hotel is on main road. They offered an AC room @ Rs. 1200 on first floor. They have not Restaurant so do not provide even tea/coffee, brings from outside on road. No mean to contact reception from room so you have to come down for any requirement. Overall an average stay.",JAGDISH RAVAL,/Profile/JAGDISHRAVAL,"Ahmedabad, India",30
