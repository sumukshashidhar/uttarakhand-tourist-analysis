Best things about room is the view from balcony , blanket given was electric(which turned out the best considering the chilly weather). food we ordered turned out to be amazing both dinner as well as breakfast, and hospitality is such that it leaves a mark.

The hotel is little away from the central Landsdowne, which is a little higher from the Hotel location. For nature lovers you can simply walk around the road in front of the hotel and get to see lots of Birds, different flowers and a beautiful view of the snow capped mountains. We visited during end-December.  Coming now to the Hotel amenities and service. The staffs are always helpful and ready to help. Room service, Food and other facilities are the best that you will get.

pauri-garhwal,Over priced hotel. Location is good. Staff wos helpful. Room was big but the sheets and blankets had the dampness smell. And it was actually too strong. Dont waste money in choosing the terrace room unless you are travelling in a group and plans to have a drink sitting outside. Also they have placed a tick tok clock just close to the bed which really annoyes during the night. I travel a lot and have stayed in hotels all over the world and have never seen even a single room with a tik tok cloak. I had to remove the batteries to stop it. The dinner and breakfast layout is pretty good. There is treck route close to hotel which goes towards the village. I suggest to go there and meet the local villagers. Its good to talk to them and know about them. I recommend to go to tarkeshwar,pankaj bansal,/Profile/travelwithbansal,"New Delhi, India",30

Check-in was smooth and the staff was courteous and welcoming. We took the valley view room on the second floor. Hotel also offers rooms with a private terrace on the third floor which gives you even better views but personally I feel it's just spending 2k bucks extra but I recommend to do it for the shear experience of it, it takes luxury and relaxation to a new level. The rooms are spic and span and are well maintained.

The view of valley from the terrace was just amazing and refreshing. The buffet of breakfast and dinner was too good. They have good number of options. Food was delicious. Driver room is also available at a short distance from the hotel. Apart from all this, they proved to be thorough gentle people. What happened was that my driver forgot his wallet and driving license in the driver room and he came to remember when we were entering Delhi. We called the hotel and asked if they can send the belongings by courier.

pauri-garhwal,"Had a memorable stay at Hotel Lans Castle, Lansdowne recently. The hotel is beautifully located, with a panoramic view of the valley below. The room was comfortable and clean, though a bit expensive at the onset of monsoon. The main attraction was the private terrace, with the deckchair and believe me, it was so lovely to gaze at the clear blue sky, which often turned cloudy. The clouds were rolling up from the valley below and used to enter our room. Food was good and reasonably priced. The staff, whether in reception, housekeeping or kitchen, is very good and we have a special thanks for the General Manager and Ms. Deepika Overall, a nice and relaxing stay..Thanks folks..

pauri-garhwal,We went for a family holiday April 28-30 this year. The hotel rooms are clean and spacious. The staff is warm and very helpful. The food is very good and the buffet had a good variety for everyone. We had an issue with our room which was promptly changed by the management. The views are good from the top floor rooms. Hotel has enough amenities to keep the kids entertained. The rooftop is very pleasant and the evening tea service is wonderful.  TIP  - Please avoid the room on top of the kitchen on the first floor. You will be subjected to the generator fumes from the next door hotel and the smell / sound from kitchen exhaust. I hope the hotel would have sorted this out by now.,Divya Singh,/Profile/divyaroyalexp,"New Delhi, India",40

Sumptous buffet breakfast , but you have to time your entry as the space can get crowded during holidays . Not much of a view from the rooms , but a lot of activities for kids and a basic gym . The management were very supportive . We had a noisy family group staying with us and they changed our rooms by giving us options away from the crowd . I was also touched by the fact that I had wanted kheer on day 1 and they had run out of it ...they remembered it and send it to my room on a complimentary basis on day 2 .

During complementary high tea, if you were to ask for coffee then bad luck, no flexibility there. Hotel rules mention TEA is the only option.   Restaurant is not good either, cutlery is stained.

Rooms with Terrace View are really nice (gives great view of the mountains) Ground staff was good, however other staff members looked a bit off. What I found missing the most was connectedness. In such a property, usually staff members make staying guests connect to the place but that wasn't the case here. Flexibility in most of the cases was left to the last. Staff was rigid enough to the timings (be it a DJ, check-out, meal hours ...) ...

In-house facilities like kids play area, gymnasium, indoor/outdoor sports area, terrace restaurant, DJ hall, swings etc are hard to find together in some of the big hotels.

Room was reasonably spacious with basic amenities. Room and bathroom were clean with clean linen. Bedding mattress has electric heating so good for winters but there was no heater in the room and you will feel once out of bed. Although they can provide a small blower in the room on request with small charge. Minor issue of blanket leaving lint which got stuck on clothes and later they changed it once informed.

A welcome drink, quick check-in process and finally we were guided into our room that had an attached terrace which gave us a view of the valley.  As awestruck as we were at the very first sight of this place, calling it love at first sight would be too superficial.

Bathroom was very neat and comfortable. Did not find the cables and under-construction house in front of the hotel too much of a problem (as written by previous reviewers). Hotel staff were very courteous and helpful.   Just beware of the diversions at Kotdwar because of flyover construction (as led by GPS).

The property is well maintained and has half trained staff(I say half because I think they can be better trained) but one of the major turn off for me was their snobbish attitude and taking customer for a ride tantrums. In hindsight, I  found the hotel also over priced for the kind of service it is providing. It is only doing well because of very few good options for hotels nearby.

The rooms are nicely maintained and the ones with the balcony are the best ones, the view from the room is just splendid. When we returned in the evening, to our surprise was a bonefire and DJ arranged on the roof top, which just made the evening perfect. Though they had arranged only one small fire so it was not sufficient for all. You can carry your booze on the roof top and they will serve the food there itself. Food served was really good both veg and non-veg. The staff was courteous and room service was quick however the service at the roof was quite slow.

pauri-garhwal,"It was one of the few who stayed in this hotel before formal launch. While searching for nice and neat hotels in Lansdowne, during weekend of 19th April, I came across this brand new property. The hotel's location is a big plus. Panoramic view of lush green valley, from most of the rooms is a very soothing experience. The rooms are well equipped and nicely planned. Hotel staff was also very helpful and motivated.   It was a good choice to have stayed in this hotel and would recommend it to all.",Sandeep_Chhatwal,/Profile/Sandeep_Chhatwal,"Noida, India",40
