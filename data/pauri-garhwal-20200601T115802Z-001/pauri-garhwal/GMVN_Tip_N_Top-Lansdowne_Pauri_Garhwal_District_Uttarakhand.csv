Drive from Kotdwar onwards is scenic and a pleasure. once you reach Lansdown and Check in GMVN wooden swiss cottages its a wonderful experience. A minimum of 2 to 3 nights stay is recommended to enjoy the beauty of the forest, calmness, sounds of breeze, birds and trees.

pauri-garhwal,While searching for the hotels in Lansdowne with amazing view I found Tip n top to be an amazing getaway but earlier I was a little sceptical about choosing the same. Yet I decided to go for it and thankfully I am more than just happy. I got awestruck by the view and how well maintained the hotel premise was. Well behaved staff and amazing host Mr. Nanda Purohit made us feel like home away from home. Food was amazing too and what amazed us was the unbelievable hotel property and how well furnished the room was. I highly recommend everyone planning to travel to Lansdowne to surely come here and have an amazing getaway in the woods.,Traveladdict,/Profile/Traveladdict199524,,50

Though I am already a proud pahadi from Dehradun, yet this place has rejuvenated a more intense pahadi feeling inside me. This weekend cannot be planned so better than traveling to Lansdowne via Kotdwara. The restro is located at the top hill, probably the last stop of Lansdowne. You will witness an intense deep fog, clouds, chilled wind, naughty monkeys and a greener hills all around. The restro manager Mr Purohit has guided us well in selecting the best cottage to stay in. I highly recommended you to try Garhwali Food there- kaphli, kadhi, jhangore ki kheer & many more in the menu. The environment is so chilled that you will forget that its summers going on.

All the facilities are available here with ample space to roam around. A truly beautiful and peaceful place to take a break from the monotonous city life. Great for all age groups.

pauri-garhwal,This is a must stay for people visiting Landsdowne. My suggestion is try and stay at least one night if your pocket doesn't allow more. The resort is located at one of the three major tourist spots of Lansdowne. You can experience the sunrise and sunset from your hotel and see the entire mountain range and clouds right from the hotel room.  And if good food and friendly staff is added to the mix it becomes a perfect vacation.,Nidhi Gupta,/Profile/Means2Madness,"New Delhi, India",50

There are multiple aspects which make this resort, the best place to stay at Lansdowne. First, this is the highest point at Lansdowne for sight seeing and a traveller will come to Tip n Top to have the view of the valley. So, why not stay near it to have the luxury of going to the sight seeing point early in the morning or late in the evening. Second, there is ample space outside your resort which is plain area to have a gathering or party in the evening, bonfire in winters are best. Many resort may give you balcony but here you have much outside space to stroll. Third, the new Swiss huts are very good, comfortable and luxurious.

These are less in luxury but worth an experience. These are difficult to book as they are not booked online, but only in GMVN office on cash payment. The staff is also good.

Landsdown is a really serene location if one wants to get away from the hustle & bustle of city life. However, staying in this room can be noisy on weekends as Tip in Top is a tourist point in Landsdown and attracts a host of people. As we Indians are loud and boisterous on our holidays, the place becomes a fish market.   The two tree top rooms were an object of curiosity and people incessantly walked up and down, taking photos on the staircase and almost peeping into the room with no thought about the privacy of the guests.

First there were bugs and insects in the room - was tough going to sleep with few of them flying in the room. Had to get up two- three times to get rid of them. Second the walls are very thin.

The tree house is good but not worth it, and there are only 2 of them.  -ves - Bad service (its Govt owned).  - No intercom.

Sadly because the location is fabulous and the rooms are pretty OK, especially the log cabins. Great views of the Himalayan range and very quiet since it's on top of a hill. It's built around a large, old Raj-era cottage, which could perhaps have been described as 'pretty' or 'quaint' if it only weren't so terribly maintained. And I mean terribly. Available rooms are a combination of a couple in the Raj cottage, a few cabins with thin wooden partition boards, and a couple of log ones (including on stilts, an interesting experience, especially since it creaks at night) and a few brand new 'Swiss' (or so they say) log cabins (which look very good",Musafir69,/Profile/Musafir69,"New Delhi, India",30

The location is by far the best you can get, clean laundry, clean washrooms n bedsheets. The only problem I see is they have a very horrible and limited list of items on their food menu. If you are an ardent fan of non-veg food you need to give them atleast 2 hours for preparation as they source it directly when ordered. Strangely the food is super costly and not worth the price. We were a group of 8 and we paid about Rs 4500 for the food for 1 night stay which seems too expensive.

You may have to do this exercise 2-3 times to have your order delivered. Many of the items listed on menu were not available.  Only good point about staying here is its location.

As for the property, it is a typical no-frills property. The one good part was large  rooms with clean sheets on the bed. The other advantage was the staff - although government owned hotels don't place a high priority on service standards, the guys here were quite flexible.
