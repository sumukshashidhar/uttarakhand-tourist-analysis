pauri-garhwal,"Hotel facilities have deteriorated over the years and my stay this this time was particular disappointing. Staff is untrained and needs grooming. Rooms are very basic, even the super deluxe rooms. Food is also average in taste and quality.",AmitBist,/Profile/AmitBist,"New Delhi, India",30

pauri-garhwal,"Quite unique infra with all modern and daily amenities within premises or else round the corner. I recommend this hotel for business deals, family occasions, birthday parties or even any social gathering within their lounge or in bar  ",Vacation356502,/Profile/Vacation356502,,50
pauri-garhwal,"It's a good choice for staying in Kotdwara, the owner, Mr. Rawat is nice & learned fellow. Very courteous & helpful. Staff is though typically 'pahadi' types but rooms are good, toilets neat & clean. It has an adjoining Bar & Resturant which serves nice food. All in all, if you are in Kotdwar you must stay here.... Value for money & comfortable stay. ",Prashant Pansari,/Profile/PrashantPansari,"Jaipur, India",50
