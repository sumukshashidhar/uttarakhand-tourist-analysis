pauri-garhwal,"The place is in a good location and is small but has a nice view of the mountains. It can be a great location for people who have a small budget but the place is in dire need for cleaning, maintenance and upkeep.",Anjana P,/Profile/DrAnjanaPant,"New Delhi, India",30
pauri-garhwal,There are not many hotels in this area. This was a nice place. It was a basic setup but everything was well-maintained and services were great. Prices are also according to the services given so we were satisfied overall.,Alfredo812,/Profile/Alfredo812,"Miami, Florida",40
pauri-garhwal,"Only staff is co-operative otherwise they charge for single person RS. 350 /- per night and for 2 people 900 /- per night and trust me the single bedroom is horrible. Only one bed and there no space for other things. No window also and for balcony you have to come outside. Than I choose other double bedroom with price RS.600 but room is very small , bathroom is so dirty no mirror in room and lots of spots in bedsheet. After few minutes I change my mind and move to another hotel in RS.900/- per night. I just want to request to owner please upload your original pictures of rooms and change your bedsheets and increase your service. ",Unknown Path,/Profile/unkpath,"New Delhi, India",20
