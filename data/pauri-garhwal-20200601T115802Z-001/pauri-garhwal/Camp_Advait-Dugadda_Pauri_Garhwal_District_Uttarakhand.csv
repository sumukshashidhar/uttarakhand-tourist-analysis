pauri-garhwal,Beauty of nature with all the evens. Trust me this place has no odds we enjoyed the place thoroughly. Our host was so so good.  Food was above average most importantly it was as home made style. Kudos for the place.,Road829839,/Profile/Road829839,,50
pauri-garhwal,"Thanx a lot to Mannu and his team , we had Lansedowne on our mind since many years and finally this deewali we went in with our family of 10 persons with Kids as young as 2years to 10 . Initially we were apprehensive with a certain negative review by a family on YouTube,  and we bluntly asked Mannu over the phone .To which he did not shy away but accepted that certain people's expectation with a nature's camp may be different based on individuals. SINCE we have been to Rishikesh Nainital etc and always stay in camps only not in resorts or hotels.  We want our kids to connect with nature and all and unplug from screens for sometime .  SO I would write this review for what to /not to expect from a camp setting and holds true for Camp Adwait too.....  Don't EXPECT.  VALET PARKING,",M dot Rehman,/Profile/Mdotrehman,,40
pauri-garhwal,Nice camp located on riverside with great staff and good food. Although the river was not brimming with water but still it was enjoyable. The tents are basic but clean. The camp ensures that it does proper disposal of its waste and leaves very little negative imprint on the environment.   Loved the cliff jumping and trek. Thanks to Mannu for taking good care about safety also to Sahil for making me experience cliff jumping.,ritukarla,/Profile/ritukarla,"New Delhi, India",50
pauri-garhwal,"It's one of the amazing places to relax and unwind yourself from the busy schedule and tense work pressure. One of the perfect places to party and relax at the same time. Natural surroundings, clean water stream, good food and perfect hospitality to add to. You can switch off your mobile phones and enjoy nature at its best. I would like to thank the entire team of camp advait for the amazing experience. Kudos..üòéüòé",SShah2012,/Profile/SShah2012,,50
pauri-garhwal,"Just visit this place once and I am sure you would want to visit it again. The best thing I found was the behaviour of the staff. They would never say no to any of your request. Even if you ask for a pink elephant they won't say no. They will at least try, that's for sure.",deepak t,/Profile/818deepakt,,50

pauri-garhwal,"We enjoyed our stay at camp advait a lot, greeted by owner Mr. Manu Shah and his one and only Bullet (dog), he is so cute and looks like lion. They pitch our camp in front of us which is an amazing experience for camping beginners. Their restaurant area is so clean, their food is so hygienic and tasty. The creativity and painting around the campsite is so cool and give you awesome feeling. Their way recycle waste things and use in their campsite is remarkable. This campsite is full of greenery and trees and has natural river pool just walking to campsite. I loved this place and wish to come again and again.",mak4u19,/Profile/mak4u19,"Delhi, New York",50
pauri-garhwal,"So i visited this place with my friends recently. We were a group of 5 people. And we had the time of our life. We also celebrated holi in the camp and believe me holi was never so much fun before. Its the best place to chill, u could be around your friends, or even if u prefer solitude, you could visit it. It has so much of the serenity! There is a river- river kho- which has the most appropriate amount of water level to swim. Not dangerous at all. They have a dog- Bullet! Its such a fun loving and the smartest dog one could meet!  They also have activities like cliff jumping, flying fox, etc. So if anyone is into it. Hell yes! Visit it. If you happy, sad, irritated, frustrated, wabt to celebrate something, angry and mad. You could totally visit this place! The food is",dancing s,/Profile/dancings2018,,50

pauri-garhwal,This is a beautiful and cosy camp tucked away in the mountains away from the chaos and trailing a river. I was here for a week and everyone working here made the most of their effort and really went out of their way to make me feel comfortable and had everything I needed. They included me as part of their family and made this feel like a home away from home. I hope to return here when I get back to India. The accommodation is comfortable for camping and clean. Toilet facilities likewise are clean and creative. The food is scrumptious and wholesome. I look forward to coming again!,Mic M,/Profile/MicM149,,50
pauri-garhwal,"This is our first camping experience we experienced in the hills and perhaps this is the best experience we would ever have. Sleeping with flowing water sound in the lap of mother nature and rising with the sun among lush green mountain is completely mesmerizing. Adding a five star flavour to this is the wonderful hospitality and fabulous food with camp fire and music. Pluck guava directly from tree and eat alongwith wonderful sun bath in the flowing stream. To reach the camp you have to cross the stream over a stone-wood bridge and the thrill begins right there, with two cute doggy named Bullet and Magzine coming to welcome you. We have to park our vehicle on the other side of the stream and there is nothing to worry. The toilets are common though clean. The service is awesome",omprakash r,/Profile/omprakashsonepur,"Gandhinagar, India",50
pauri-garhwal,"This camp is the best thing I did in my trip to Lansdowne. They give you clean, beautiful, cozy tents. Good but not great food. Great chai and coffee. Beautiful environment. The team of this camp is warm, helping, friendly, and sweet. They know u r here to rejuvenate and they let you do that. This is highly recommended.",Rashi V,/Profile/706rashiv,,50
pauri-garhwal,"I stayed here on 14 and 15 december. Being a weekday there wasn't any rush at all. I came here with my girlfriend and my moto was just to spend some quality time with her away from the rush hush of delhi. I had seen the pictures and reviews of the camp and decided to go there on the basis of that.But when i actually reached here i felt the reviews are just an understatement, this place is even more better.",shakti s,/Profile/shaktis23,,50
pauri-garhwal,Visited this place with my besties for a weekend getaway just in search of some peaceful time from my hectic schedule and believe me had a great time in this amazing looking camp.  To visit this camp you have to cross a lil river by foot which makes this camp even more amazing as I have never seen any other camp like that! But like everything in this world this also has ngtve thng to it as you have to park your car on the other side of the river which I personally dnt feel comfortable in as keeping in mind the security of your vehicle.  Food they cook is amazing as it all has a home cooked touch to it!! Plus the staff of this camp is so nice that you will end up visiting this place again and again for their hospitality!  In short do not waste your time looking for  hotels in,RoHan M,/Profile/RoHanM860,,50
pauri-garhwal,"We booked the camp for an overnight stay. It is a few kilometers from Lansdowne. The camp site is along the river at the base of the himalayan hills. The tents are set up in a small Guava orchard.  From the main road you need to come down the hill and cross the river to reach the tents. Ensure that you wear sturdy footwear because the rocks beneath the river are uneven and might cause shoe tearing. Also, avoid chappals / slippers as it might flow away with the current of the river. The water is knee deep.  The tents are of different sizes and are provided with mattress, pillow and quilt. Carry mosquito repellent. Also carry quick dry clothes as there might be cases when you have to cross the river multiple times to carry out camp activities.   Vegetarian food is provided for",Sukanya_Halder,/Profile/Sukanya_Halder,"Ghaziabad, India",30
pauri-garhwal,"The campsite is so serene and quiet with extra cozy and comfortable arrangements. One cannot help but fall in love with the place when you wake up to the sweet sound of water flowing across the nearby stream and a sight of lush green mountains is just breathtaking. The food we ate was cooked out of vegetable grown in their backyard itself and tasted beyond good. We enjoyed walking around the campsite during sunset and played outdoors games on the playground within the campsite. The staff was so hospitable and kind, they paid extra attention to what our taste and preferences were. I was very pleased with my stay and although short and sweet this time I hope to be back for a longer visit in the future.",Charvi N,/Profile/charvin2017,,50
pauri-garhwal,"It was a pleasant stay at Camp Advait. Greeted by Rauty and Raju on arrival. Everything from food to activities were in place and handled really well. The charm of the camp is river flowing besides the camp. Nitin, Raju and team have done some great work, in bringing the camp to what it is today. I wish them all the luck, and plan to visit again soon. Although the perfect time to stay would be September onwards.",Vineet Kumar,/Profile/Vineet86,"New Delhi, India",50
pauri-garhwal,"Located in the middle of nowhere, situated perfectly in the lap of nature, Camp Advait provides a space which allows travelers to connect with nature in a beautiful manner. Peaceful, serene, quiet and green..waking up to the mountains and sleeping under a carpet of stars, the experience was incredible. The finger licking food is an added advantage and nothing beats the feeling of sipping chai when surrounded by mountains! Pet friendly for sure, Bullet the crazy and absolutely amazing dog is the perfect companion for animal lovers.    A lovely escape, the perfect getaway, peace and serenity at its best! Thank you Camp Advait for the lovely experience. Definitely going to visit again and again and again :)",Juhi P,/Profile/JuhiP44,,50
pauri-garhwal,"My first reaction on reaching the campsite was 'wow'. You can feel the exuberant vibes right from the camp entrance. The camp is located by the side of a small river. When I reached my tent, I was amazed to have well kempt and luxurious tents. There are trees all around, the bird houses and a friendly dog. It is the best place to disconnect from fast city life.  We started our day with flying fox. Not much height but it was fun. the satff there is freindly and cheerful. We enjoyed the bonfire in the evening underneath the stars. It was a spectacular experience. Next day was another group activity organised by the camp people, which was also fun. Lansdowne doesn't have much to explore. But this campsite is the best place to spend your time in the quite and serene town.",dhaarna k,/Profile/dhaarnak,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
pauri-garhwal,"We went with a travel group from Travel Triangle and hence all the arrangement were already made pre hand by them. Nevertheless, I would be stating my experience below as a guest.   Firstly, this place is 20 kms before Lansdowne. Network signals do come but the internet is hard to be working.  STAFF 1. Very supportive and friendly 2. Helpful with anything that was required  BASIC AMENITIES / STAY 1. Despite being a camping site, it as well maintained washrooms for both boys and girls. We went at a time when it was quite chilly, and we could easily get hot water as well for the shower. Well appreciated. But please carry all the basic toiletries with yourself as you won't get any there.   2. The camps were neat and tidy, with 2 blankets for each person living in it.

Excellent food quality for veg lovers, non veg was also good but not as per the expectations, awesome riverside camps. We have experienced excellent hospitality from the camp staff (specially Harish and Kanchan).  Various outdoor activities available with the camp.

Based on river side which is a bonus apart from excellent food and amazing ambience. Enjoyed the Cliff juming and flying fox activities to the fullest.

pauri-garhwal,"While this was never on my list, camp Advait is probably the best chilling place to be at. The 5 minutes trek towards the camp where the river bed is surrounded by the mountains from both the sides, creates all types of excitement and mysteries for the camp.  As we crossed the milestone indicating 'Camp Advait- 0km', we analysed an amicable settlement, showcasing the most sorted zoning  of the zones like the 'main foyer' , 'levelled tent area', 'bonfire space', 'secluded cafeteria' including various spots for the activities.  After we cooped in our cozy tents admist the cool breeze, the shining sun finally broke through and we made our way towards the streaming water bed after , witnessing a serene combination of the flowing river surrounded by the lush green mountain",dakshita b,/Profile/dakshitab,,50
pauri-garhwal,"We happened to be there by chance, as we did not get accommodation at the desired hotel at Lansdowne (Uttarakhand). We were simply mesmerized at the beauty of the camp site, overwhelmed at the welcome and care we received from the Camp Advait team. Our special thanks to Manu M Shah, Nitin, Virendra, Amit and Harish for making our 2 night stay a memorable one. The camp is situated at a distance of about 1.5 km from Dugadda town, which is between Kotdwar (15 kms) and Lansdowne (25 km) towns on the NH 534. It is about 6-7 hrs drive (about 240 kms) from Delhi.The camp is built on a valley by the side of Dugadda-Rishikesh road with hills on both sides and a beautiful stream (a tributary of the river Khow), flowing by its side.
