pauri-garhwal,"Disappointing hotel- run down, noisy, limited menu & ordinary food, the server in the restaurant was very hard working and a good guy which was the only bright spot at this hotel. Nice views from the hilltop. Not recommended and extremely expensive for what it offers even food is very expensive here. Avoid.",Ajit Menon,/Profile/637ajitm,"Noida, India",20
pauri-garhwal,"Hotel is in a ridiculous location if you are looking for short overnight stay. We had to go through extremely tiny road to the hill top. The last segment was a private road full of gravel and stones only and at times was so narrow that we were afraid we may fall off the cliff. And upon reaching we realized the hotel was on multiple levels of the hill. The rooms were on different levels. It is nearly impossible if you have any luggage to carry as it is very strenuous. From room to the pathetic looking so called restaurant was itself a climb up the hill. The scenery from the hilltop may look great in day time, but considering you are in a ghat area, there are much better scenic places you can visit. We looked at 3 rooms whose condition was pathetic and decided to look elsewhere",Eswar S,/Profile/Eswar108,,10
pauri-garhwal,"The location of the resort stands out. The road to reach there is not maintained but once you are at the top you would spend most of your time there. The rooms are large with beautiful views outside. The staff is quite courteous, they would prepare customised food for breakfast and dinner. You can get unlimited wood for bonfire during chilly winter nights. Very good romantic off beat resort. Only thing is the amount of effort you need to make to reach the resort. Specially when there is nothing else to do in Srinagar town.",Mayank Sarawagi,/Profile/sarawgimayank,"Mumbai, India",50
