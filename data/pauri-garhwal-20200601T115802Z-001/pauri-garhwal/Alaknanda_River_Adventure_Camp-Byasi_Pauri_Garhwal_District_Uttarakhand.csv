pauri-garhwal,"Ok, I visited this place 3 years ago, when the property was beside the river. Have heard that it now has been moved to the forest area. The staff here is quite nice and helpful, the meals and tents are also quite satisfactory. However, one thing this place lacks is they don't provide guests with transportation, not even till the rafting point. If that is worked upon then this resort will be one of the best budget places to stay in Rishikesh.",Nidhi S,/Profile/NidhiS891,"New Delhi, India",40
pauri-garhwal,"As per older reviews than 2015 it had been a great camp when it was on beach side but after 2015 as most of river side camps has been closed and they moved to forest areas, this camp was not that good.  Whenever we think about camping in rishikesh or anywhere, 3 things come in mind.  1. Location - camping site  2. Hospitality / Service 3. Budget - Not a big factor but for a frequent traveler like me, it matters :)    1. In terms of Location, it is just an average. It is located next to Shivpuri and 3 miles before Jumpin heights. A small water stream flows along side but water level was very low in this season of march. It is 6 km away from main Ganga river. I am assuming in rainy season or in Nov-Jan it could feel better as there was no greenery now. They have around 16 tents",Vishugaddi,/Profile/Vishugaddi,"Washington, District of Columbia, United States",20
pauri-garhwal,"The camp is located at Beach no.21 which is around 30 kms from rishikesh.  You have to walk down to camp from the highway.  Once you reach down the camp manager will allocate the tents for you.  The tents were decent but could have been much better.  Since it is a beach camp there is always some dust in the tents.  The ambience is great and quite relaxing.  River Ganga flowing along side the camp.  The camp has sports activities like Volleyball, Cricket etc.  The service is good but the food could have been much better.  We only liked their breakfast.  They mention that evening snacks will be served during bonfire but what actually is served cannot be termed as snack.  you only get peanuts & pappad.  Overall a decent place but there are better places than this offering same",Destinations Unlocked,/Profile/jatinc638,"Ghaziabad, India",30
pauri-garhwal,"It was such a great experience staying at Alaknanda River Rafting Camp. The camps were nicely located facing the Ganges. Loads of activities like Rock Climbing, Rappelling, Vollyball, Kayaking was at their best on the shore of Ganges. The quality of food they serve is very good & the service - i believe that the service boys don't know the word 'NO', whatever you ask they will arrange. The highlight of camp was rafting with help of their expertise we got so much of thrill that it is beyond explanation.",ABHPRAG30,/Profile/ABHPRAG30,"Faridabad, India",40
pauri-garhwal,"It was such a great experience staying at Alaknanda River Rafting Camp. The camps were nicely decorated and opened up to majestic views of mountains. We played volleyball and many other games on the shore of Ganges. But the highlight of course was rafting that gave us so much thrill that it is beyond explanation. To sum up, we enjoyed being there and would love to visit again",Kandpal,/Profile/Kandpal,India,50
