pauri-garhwal,The view is good and the food is fine too.We went in early March and no heater in the room and one had to pay per day.The LAN line of the hotel does not work with zero signal and no wifi in any room.Thus promising free wifi is a waste....The General manager is arrogant and rude.The Tata sky most English and popular Hindi channels weâ€™re not available.Just 5 minutes walk from the hotel one could get service...,SANJUKTA_12,/Profile/SANJUKTA_12,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",20
