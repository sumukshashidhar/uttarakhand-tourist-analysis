pauri-garhwal,"Food quality and taste is very poor, and the amount they are charging for the same is very high. Service is poor, even the staff does not offer salad while serving dinner. They took 20 min to serve food for only 5 peoples, ",AnkitTayal62,/Profile/AnkitTayal62,"New Delhi, India",10

pauri-garhwal,"I stayed two nights in this hotel when I was on vacations with my family. First of all, if you are visiting Lansdowne this hotel is off the route. Itâ€™s around 17km from Lansdowne but yes if you are looking for a peace full stay this could be your right choice.   During the first day they gave me room on the first floor - my experience was not good with this room as it was very small in size and not even properly cleaned. On the second day they shifted me to the room on first floor and it was specious and much better than room on round floor.   They offer complementary breakfast first day they offered multiple variety and on the second day there was not choice and only one item in b/f.  So, overall I had an average experience staying in this hotel.",DeepakGarg,/Profile/DeepakGrg,"New Delhi, India",30
pauri-garhwal,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for three nights in January 2018. Mr. Negi, who manages this property, made sure that we had a comfortable stay and gave us a good room with very good views and lots of sunlight. The hotel is actually quite a distance from main lansdowne. However, guests with their own vehicle should not face any problems. The location, given that it is a bit secluded, will be preferred by those wanting to avoid the hustle and bustle. The food is average and the choices are limited. The hotel staff though are very courteous and helpful. Overall, a decent hotel, reasonably clean, average food, distance from main Lansdowne can be an issue depending on what one is looking for - stayiny right in the main Lansdowne area or prefering a peaceful, secluded location.",debdeep2015,/Profile/debdeep2015,"Ghaziabad, India",30
pauri-garhwal,"Stayed at The Rock Heaven Resort for 3 nights, the stay was very comfortable. The staff were very helpful and accommodating.The view from the balcony of the hotel is very beautiful and soothing. Me and my family enjoyed the stay.  The food was excellent and I would say it was value for money.",Ratnajit B,/Profile/RatnajitB1,,50
pauri-garhwal,"I've visited this hotel on last weekend. Property is new and perfect for family stay. Located somewhere between main Lansdowne and Tarkeshwar dham. It is around 25-30km from main market of Lansdowne but if you want peace, for which we all are looking now a days, it is the right place. Tarkeshwar dham is near to this place which is the most peaceful holy place I've ever seen. Food is good and service is impressive. Local people in service are very calm and always at one's disposal. I've got really good deal and was not expecting this standard at this price but it was. Few loop holes are there but since it is new property we can ignore it. Mr. Negi ji, the Manager, is very helpful person and is working hard to make his guest's stay more pleasant. I will strongly recommend this",Vipin K,/Profile/vipin191184,"New Delhi, India",40
