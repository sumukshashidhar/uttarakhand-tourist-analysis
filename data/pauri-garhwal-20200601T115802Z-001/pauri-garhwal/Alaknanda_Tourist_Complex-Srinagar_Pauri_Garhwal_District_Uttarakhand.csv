pauri-garhwal,i have styaed in the hotel for two nights with family consisiting of senior citizen and kids. Stay was pleasant. Freindly and cooperative staff. Restaurent attached did not server well and did not look good also.i stayed in deluxe and economy rooms. Deluxe rooms and not worth the cost but econmony and family rooms are worth the cost. Rooms are spacious in all categories.  Building and rooms are  old and at times smells badly. Only short coming is there is no rooms in the ground floor.,Ajay T,/Profile/AjayT554,,40
