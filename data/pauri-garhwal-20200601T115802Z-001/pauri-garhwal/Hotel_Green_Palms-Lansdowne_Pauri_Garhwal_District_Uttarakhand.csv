pauri-garhwal,We decided to book this hotel after going through the reviews which were available online. We booked 3 rooms on the top floor for 8 members. The rooms were nice and spacious. The verandah outside the rooms on the 4th floor had an amazing view of the valley. The location was also very good with main market in the vicinity. The only drawback that we faced here was that the network connectivity was very poor. ,Gunjan Ajmani,/Profile/GunjanAjmani,"New Delhi, India",40
pauri-garhwal,"I booked this hotel only on last time once I reach Lansdowne. I booked a child friendly room means having a double story bed for child specific which was the best part, because I feel when ur child's are comfortable & enjoying up & down, u will feel the same.  Location is good, u can enjoy morning walk near to hotel which I did & found refreshing & feel good.  Even v tried limited food items, but found them good & hygienic. Staff at reception is very polite & customer centric. I requested for a cab for local sightseeing and they arrange it very quick.  The only thing I want to mention about network connectivity as only bsnl works there. Even they hv WiFi at reception but sometimes not worked due to bad weather. Last one TV channels may be added particularly for child's.  ",Deepak Aggarwal,/Profile/deepaknarnaul,"New Delhi, India",40

pauri-garhwal,This hotel was great to stay with family or friends but there is restricted option for food. and This hotel doesn't provide hygienic food. You cannot expect taste from them. I don't recommend this for any food lover. However hotel quality is average with accomodation,alonebrother,/Profile/alonebrother,,20
pauri-garhwal,If you have no other option left in landsdowbe than only you must stay here. Food is average Staff didn't have courtesy to acknowledge your request ....like I had asked for some tea bags n sugar which I never got. Day 1 bfast was just served with Poha n paratha which they mentioned as buffet bday  Day 2 Breakfast service starts by 9am. Before that you have to bear with your hunger. Like I suffered with my family on the day of departure in morning without having the bfast. They served the Dinner food which was kept in table under cold temperatures upon asking they replied we have called you 5minutes before from the room.  Location is only the plus point rest is below average.  I will not recommend any of my friends n trip advisor people to go there.

pauri-garhwal,"Stayed in Green Palms with family during a short trip to Lansdowne. Facility is pricey considering some of the more famous & better accommodation in the area We found the hotel through MAKE MY TRIP and booked for 22nd & 23rd August 2018 getaway. Considering that Lansdowne doesn’t have too many good staying options, one is restricted to the few available in the vicinity. Well maintained property with amazing view from terrace & Balcony, hospitality was rather cold  The service was satisfactory, Food is strictly average & those who relish their fare will be disappointed since the options are extremely restricted.

Kitchen service is also very poor, the guys wouldn't even bother to listen when it comes to complimentary breakfast. Room service was OK OK. not impressive.  Good things: Valley View, Wifi connection & Egg curry(this one was good).   Conclusion: Not recommended, it doesn't give you a feel good factor.

Since all the spots are near the market road and this hotel is 5-6 km away from there, so each trip will cost you at least 200 bucks. Other than that, had a comfortable stay here. The beautiful morning view out of my balcony was the highlight of our stay here.

It is very near to the road connecting Kotdwar and Lansdowne, so that you can easily walk and avail the ferry to Lansdowne, but not directly on the highway, so you do not have the constant noise of the passing by vehicles. To begin with, we reached the place about 3 hours before our check in time. Unfortunately, our room was still occupied by then.

There is no Ac's not even in their bst rooms not even a bar fridge in any of their room.   The hospitality of the staff is very much appreciable. They do their best to fill the void created by the lack other facilities.   Not all the food items from the menu are available, but they had a great taste.

Just after this hotel, towards the Lansdowne, you get a checkpost wherein you have to pay Rs 100 every day. So, it would be better to go to landsdowne for just one day and comeback to the hotel.

pauri-garhwal,The third & fourth floor rooms facing the valley have a good view. The rooms are not great. Water collects in the bathroom & the bathroom stinks. The rooms are designed in a way that you cannot keep the curtains drawn as the balcony is common. So one cannot enjoy the view or landscape. Due to this the sound level is also high since people from the rooms located in the rear use the balcony too thus making it very noisy.  They charge separately for using a room heater which is very much needed in the cold & windy nights.  The redeeming feature of the hotel is the hotel staff & the food.

Only BSNL works there. Tarkeshwar is 34 km away from the hotel and the road is very good. Overall a good place for a small family and a short break.

pauri-garhwal,"We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights and my experience was just about good. The rooms were very good and maintained, but all the rooms open in a common balcony per floor. So no real privacy.  Location - Very Nice view, 5 KM range from popular tourist points Food - Needs a lot of improvement, Buffet Breakfast was really bad, apart from Paranthas, everything else tasted average. Timing of Breakfast is also weird. It starts at 8:30 AM. Service - Service was average again. Last day there was some hot water issue in the solar geyser and despite repeated complaints, it was not resolved. Staff - Excellent. The staff however was very polite and helpful, kitchen staff, receptionist Pawan, everyone was willing to help. Overall an average propery, but can really be improved with better",SM8324,/Profile/SM8324,"New Delhi, India",30

pauri-garhwal,I booked a semi deluxe room for the weekend and was very disappointed to see that it was a room with no view or any actual window. The only window was the one facing the corridor. Only few rooms have a view that too it opens up to a common balcony so you cannot actually keep it open as people would get a look inside. This was just a tip of the iceberg. By afternoon we had few families who had occupied the neighboring rooms and it started to get worse.Not that we havent stayed in family hotels but the paper thin walls made our stay a nightmare. We were able to hear everything that they spoke about and it seemed like they were sitting right next to us. Moreover their small kid kept of crying the entire day!  when we asked for a room change they declined stating that all rooms are,ashley_travelgyan,/Profile/ashley_travelgyan,"New Delhi, India",20

pauri-garhwal,"We found the hotel through Trip Advisor and booked through Cleartrip for an August 15 getaway. Driving in from Delhi was smooth because of the National Holiday and because we started quite early (04:30 am). Though we reached early (10:15 am), the hotel welcomed us and gave us a nice room(402) facing the valley. The room is adequate for a couple and we had booked an extra bed for our kid. As this is a new property, the rooms and all amenities are new and well maintained. The staff were all pleasant and helped in every manner possible. We went around Landsdowne till late evening when the mist came in and cut visibility to a few meters. The Hotel had a good parking space for our vehicle. We could not get an early lunch before going out (lunch starts only at 1:30 pm) and hence had",sabharim,/Profile/sabharim,"New Delhi, India",50

pauri-garhwal,"We stayed in this newly built hotel for a weekend and had a great time. First and foremost, staff is very polite and courteous including the owner. They will keep asking for your feedback on service, food etc.   Location of this resort is pretty good and has a clear valley view from most of the rooms. We were originally provided with a room which had no valley view. On our request, they shifted to a valley view room. They have common balcony concept which offers lots of space on each floor for kids  to play. They offer indoor games such as carrom. Food quality is better than any other restaurants in Lansdowne. They offered breakfast and dinner as part of the package but in the absence of other occupants asking for buffet, they offered alacarte.  The only things they should work",Amit B,/Profile/AmitB273,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
pauri-garhwal,"We had to unexpectedly check into this hotel as my booking to another hotel through makemytrip was refused by that hotel. We were a group of 6 friends and we reached this hotel through the sign boards placed along the road side. We got two rooms in this hotel and it turned out to be a blessing in disguise for us. The property is newly built and the rooms, beds, towels and linen were all very clean. The staff was very courteous. During our stay the owner was also present there and he kept on asking us for any services we wanted. There is a lift in the hotel which was good. The restaurant though a bit small but the food was pretty OK. The only thing missing was a play area but the staff provided us board games like chess, carrom and we had a wonderful time.
