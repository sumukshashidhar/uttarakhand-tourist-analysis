pauri-garhwal,"Hotel snow cliff is situated at gumkhal which is 12 km (30-40min) drive from lansdowne. If u are travelling from rishikesh route to lansdowne then it is best suited, otherwise if you are reaching there from najibabad and kotdwara route via lansdowne then it will add for extra 12 km driving to stay. All rooms are provided with spacious balconies from where the view of the place is amazing. You can also see a distant range of snow covered mountains, i think they were probably himalayas (not sure about this, and forget to confirm with the peoples nearby there). Stay here was pleasant, comfort beddings, but food and other facilities regarding intercomm and toiletries were average but the staff behavior was very good which could make up for these.

pauri-garhwal,"My friend and I made the classic mistake of judging a book (read hotel here) by its cover. All the pictures were fantastic and we thought we were in for a lovely stay in a quaint place. What we instead got was a room with sub-par cleanliness, no hot water, fairly lazy staff, and just about average food. The only thing that was enjoyable about the room was the balcony which overlooked the side of the mountain that was fairly uninhabited and therefore fairly quiet. Definitely not worth the 3,000 that we paid per night.",Anandita B,/Profile/878ananditab,"New Delhi, India",20

I stayed in this hotel 10th and 11th June, 2017 and paid price applicable for peak season. However, i got to stay in the room which is best at its untidiness. Roof tops are full of seepage marks and plasters are falling down. In washroom, no exhaust fan and ventilator for that has no windowpane. This opened the doors for insects, mosquitoes and flying ants during evening and nights when lights are on. Room service become reasonably ok when i scolded them for serving rice with hair and broken crockery.

pauri-garhwal,"Visited Lansdowne over the weekend in June 2017 (9th-11th). Had booked a family room, based on a recommendation by a neighbour who had already been here earlier. The only thing he mentioned about this hotel was, don't expect much out of this place, but you would fall in love with the view that the hotel provides.   So true were his words, that the moment we checked into the hotel and moved into the room booked for us (Room No 201, second floor), my jaws dropped at the sight of the mountain ranges that were clearly visible from the attached balcony.   This was exactly what we had planned these 2-days for... relax and enjoy the tranquility of the Himalayan ranges overseeing our room. The family room was quite spacious with two double beds.

pauri-garhwal,Lansdowne is a small non commercial hill station and that's the best part about it. we went there in end of June and where all other hill stations were overcrowded this one was calm and serene. There is not much to do here if you are looking for adventure  but it is an awesome place to relax and rejuvenate. The hotel is at a little high altitude from the main town. The view is superb.

I read some reviews here which mentioned about the hotel at a lonely place, away from Lansdowne, no place for dinner etc...it gave me some worry. But I reviewed more of the positive ones and started the journey. I started from gurgaon and the distance is approx 280 kms. I drove and took the route to Gumkhal via Delhi,ghaziabad,Meerut,bijnor,najibabad,kotdwar,Gumkhal. The drive to Gumkhal was good as I started 5 am in the morning and reached Gumkhal by 10 am. Reason to start early was to avoid traffic in Meerut. Excellent road connectivity and specially the roads from kotdwar to Gumkhal is like driving on clouds.
