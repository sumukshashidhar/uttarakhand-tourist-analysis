pauri-garhwal,"We were group of 5 families including kids and adults. We had one of the best holidays here. The camp was very well maintained with all facilities available. The adventure activity team was very professional, knowledgeable and skilled. We asked for activities and they arranged it and above all they wanted us to really experience it. There was rafting, day trekking, night trekking, rappling, river crossing, volley ball, bonfire and many more. The team had full knowledge of various plants and gave us first hand experience during the trekking. The property is safe for kids and they enjoyed a lot. Food was great and service was always with a smile. Would love to visit again. Highly recommended  The camp site is located bit far but easily accessible by vehicle.        Tents are",Gaurav Madan,/Profile/gauravmadan10,,50
