pauri-garhwal,"A beautiful place to relax with great hosts.  Pooja and Ashish are working really hard to ensure their guests make the most out of their visits. They're warm, hospitable and respect the guest's choice whether one wants to just relax, persue a hobby or explore during trek. Thank to Anil bhaiya, our trip became far more fun. He is the sous-chef, helper, trek guide, story teller, photographer and ensures you get whatever you ask for. The house is an original pahadi house and the owner looks after it and also cooks for the guests. It has simple rooms with all basic amenities like hot water, clean washroom, comfortable bed and blankets etc. There are 5-6 bedrooms that have double beds but they put up an extra cot on request. A beautiful lawn and a small corridor accompanies the house",Prachi14,/Profile/PrachiGoil,,50
