pauri-garhwal,"A place to rejuvenate and reconnect with nature,yourself and family. Service was excellent,the property manager Mr. Singh,Dinesh our guide in the woods, and Henant the chef, all were warm and helpful especially as we were traveling with kids and elderly. Pictures don't do justice to the view from the property and a hike in those woods will heal you. The property has a beautiful library that will definitely inspire you to sit down read & write. Thank you @seclude.in Lansdowne for an experience and memories that will be cherished for a long time to come.",Sheetal,/Profile/Sheetalrao01,,50
pauri-garhwal,"It's a beautiful villa. Very spacious well designed interiors.The staff is very polite, well behaved and sincere.  Reaching the place is a bit tricky. It's best to call the driver a few hundred metres downhill, if you're not used to driving in the hills.  Coming to the food, it's fairly good but quite overpriced. Even vegetarian food will cost as much as a meal in a Khan Market restaurant.",Salik Ahmad,/Profile/salik765,,50
pauri-garhwal,"Great place and excellent service and food too. Must visit places. One of the best seclude.. we were six people, had the best trip. The place is really secluded as the name suggests, at the top of the hill. A great drive experience too ..",Ayush,/Profile/Ayushagrawal98,,50

pauri-garhwal,"Superb location.  Amazing service by staff. Great food. It was an amazing experience. The location, interiors of bungalow is just too good. Weather was amazing. Comfort of room was good. Special mention to Bhagat singh, Dinesh and Chef Hemant. The service was too good. ",pratik86,/Profile/pratik86,Mumbai,50
pauri-garhwal,This is an amazing experience to stay. Truly secluded from all the noise and pollution of metro cities.....with lot of greenery around. It would be great fun if you come in a group of 4-8 people. The staff is very accommodating. The only thing that you need to confirm before your booking is about the vehicle you are travelling with. Please confirm with the staff as you will have to travel around 1 km on a Kachcha road with areas of incline.,reemaraman,/Profile/reemaraman,"New Delhi, India",50

Hoping to visit super soon",Samar Gularia,/Profile/SamarG23-_-_-_yo,,50
pauri-garhwal,"Our 2-night stay at Seclude Lansdowne was nothing less than an experience full of tranquil and beautiful sun landscape sights. The property is situated 20 kms downward of Lansdowne town, with a narrow kuccha road taking you to the property (you can even trek here).  The homestay is well maintained with the best modern facilities, and yet gives you a homely feeling. Mr. Hemant is an excellent cook, you are sure not miss home-cooked food in his presence. Mr. Bhagat Singh will make sure that you are at comfort and all your needs are taken care of. Truly recommend this for an escape from the hustle.",RUSHIN S,/Profile/rushinshah64,,50

pauri-garhwal,"We could not have asked for a better trip! The place as the name says is secluded from hustle and bustle, and nested amongst the trees. It is a difficult drive to the resort from the main road but worth the effort.   We stayed at the wordsmith room. The rooms are clean and tidy, the washrooms are hygienic and well maintained and the food was excellent. The place offers a lot of books which you can read and that is exactly what we did, you can do digital detox if you like.   We also took a 6km trek from the resort to Lansdowne town, it took us 3 hours but it could be done easily in 2-2.5hrs. Highly recommend the trek as you will find yourself immersed in the natural beauty of the forest. The town itself was a little disappointing but the experience of trekking was great.

pauri-garhwal,Had a great stay. Service was excellent and so was the food and other amenities. A must visit place if you are looking for a super laid back vacation. Bonfires and Bar Be Qs were like icing on the cake.,Nitin,/Profile/Nitin140582,,50
pauri-garhwal,"Beautiful cottage in the lap of clouds hugging mountain range. One place which I will recommend to everyone who is looking for a calm, chill environment and a  magistically picturesque view. Air is so clean which most of the delhite need today. The property was neatly kept & the food quality is also good & the best part you get to eat Onions :) If you are looking for a place which is away from the crowd & want to enjoy the peace and ice-bucket challenge SECLUDE is the right place.",Himanshu S,/Profile/478himanshus,,40
pauri-garhwal,We went in a group of 4. The stay was awesome. Staff is courteous. Manager Bhagat Singh is helpful and soft spoken. They prepare fresh food so the taste is very good. The rooms offer a splendid view of the mountains. The road to the hotel is steep and uneven but after reaching there everything vanishes. Washrooms are clean and the rooms are really beautiful. Overall it was a memorable experience. ,Sukrit,/Profile/Sukritdutt,,50
pauri-garhwal,"The place as the name suggests is actually a secluded property amongst lush green trees. It is quiet a treat with breath taking views of the mountains. You will need a good 4Ã—4 vehicle to reach the place as it has at least 2km off road track from the main road. The staff of 3 is very courteous and friendly and they take good care of you. The place is nicely done up. Clean rooms and washrooms, heating and ac in the rooms and a great food menu too to order from. A must visit place if you are seeking some peaceful time in the mountains.",Deepak Sharma,/Profile/DeepakSharma3180,,50
pauri-garhwal,"Had a brilliant stay.It was clean, in a good location, served a great breakfast and the staff were extremely helpful. It was home away home experience the only one issue is probably if someone travels off season is that the route for reaching the place is bit difficult but rest everything is awesome about the property especially the view and home cooked food.  Would definitely recommend and would certainly stay here againðŸ˜ƒ.",Monika Sharma,/Profile/Molie1,,50
pauri-garhwal,"The place was an absolute joy. Couldn't have asked for better accommodation in Lansdowne. Yes, the road to the place is a little challenging, but it is sure to give you memories of a brilliant adventure. Once there, the staff treats you like family. Bhagat ji, the local manager was there to tend to all of our needs, always with a smile on his face. The cook, Hemant Ji was quite adept at his art, and made us whatever we asked for, even if off the menu. Also, the domestic help Dinesh was always there to assist us, again with a smile, be it understanding the equipment at the place, or to just fetch us anything we may feel a want for. There were also other people staying with us and together we had a beautiful time, away from all the hustle bustle of the world, Floyd playing on the",Manav,/Profile/ManavS1929,,50
pauri-garhwal,Very good hospitality along with property. Recommended homestay for relaxation. Food is really good.   Can enjoy with family and friends far from city life. Manager Mr Bhagat is really coorperative and able to satisfy our requirements and needs,Pradeep kumar,/Profile/Ravinder_16,,50
pauri-garhwal,"When in doubt try SECLUDE! We decided to stay at this place out of curiosity... And what a beautiful stay it was. The place is very comfortably decorated with fantastic selection of books and equipped with all the necessities for a hill station. It offers luxury with spacious rooms, well trained butler and cook Hemant, Dinesh and impeccable cleanliness. Recommend Chilly chicken and paneer methi malai. Even parantha for breakfast and  always ready for instructions.   Located at a point on hill where you get a fantastic view of sunset and sunrise with ample sun to bask in.   Very close to woods which is a perfect landing for great pictures, picnic lunch or a refreshing walks.  All and my experience was amazing and very relaxing. ",umang k,/Profile/673umangk,,50
pauri-garhwal,"Just what you need when you want to ""Time-Out"" your busy life. The location was just perfect away from the hustle bustle of town. Me and my friends loved our stay because the caretaker and the cook really made the while experience noteworthy. Im definitely revisiting Seclude .PS: Do try their pakoras and peanut masala.",Anonyaa Bosu,/Profile/Anonyaabosu,,50
pauri-garhwal,We loved our stay at Seclude Lansdowne. We didn't face any problem to reach the destination. The cleanliness was proper. The rooms were according to the theme and well maintained. The staff was very professional and nice and the food made by them was also very good. Best things about the place is that you don't feel the need to go out of that place. Sunset and sunrise view from the hotel was also exceptionally beautiful. Overall it was a great experience for all of us.,Muskan Aggarwal,/Profile/Mini12031999,,50
pauri-garhwal,"We visited Seclude Lansdowne in the last week of May 2019. The place is beautifully situated in the midst of dense woods that makes the stay really a lot of pleasure. The last 3kms of the approach to this place is not motorable. Once you reach this place, the food, the stay, the books, the environment everything is memorable. A  special mention to the extremely courteous staff (Dharmender, Arjun, Rahul, Madan)....kudos to their hospitality. Lansdowne is about 45 minutes away from this place and the beautiful Tarkeshwar Temple is worth a visit. Highly recommend this place but stay indoors after dark and assess the potential of the vehicle that you take to this place. The resort does support pick/drop from their vehicle in the non-motorable roads.",Anand S,/Profile/AnandS1942,"Mumbai, India",50
pauri-garhwal,And Seclude it was . Tucked away amidst thick foliage is this four room well appointed house with two nice youngsters Arjun and Rohit to take care of food etc.  Good part is itâ€™s location away from humdrum of hill stations. Half hour / 19 kms from Lamsdowne market .   Tarkeshwar temple which is nice couple of hours drive of about 40 kms .  Nice view from Seclude of the valley . Amazing sunrise and sunset view from the balcony.  RecommendTrek from Seclude to Lansdowne by kutccha road is about 10 kms and 3 hours.   Though house keeping and hygiene were acceptable it can be further improved.   ,Sunil Misra,/Profile/sunilmisr,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
pauri-garhwal,"We had booked Seclude Lansdowne for three days in October, 2018. It turned out to be what I wished for - a memorable vacation after a long time.   If you're booking this place, please keep two things in mind. One; you should stick to the premises after dark. The place is in the midst of a woodland and locals recount about wild animals prowling after dark. One had even spotted a tiger once on the hilltop; though the veracity is questionable.  Second; assess the potential of your car. The ascent trail leading to the property from main road is not motorable, particularly on rainy days, unless you have a 4-wheel drive, good tires, sound engine, an indomitable will, and fine skills. We parked our car on the side of the main road, where a shopkeeper named Debu readily offered to keep",Rajat G,/Profile/981rajatg,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
pauri-garhwal,"Though as its name suggests, it is secluded from the crowdy places, but once you are able to locate it, you will find the hunt to be worth it.Staff there was amazing and soo cooperating. they made all the things available whatever we asked for. First step we 5 friends entered in the amazingly designed VILLA and our reaction was WAOOOOWW, we are not goin anywhere leaving this place. Home away from home. Woofers, LCD, Books, kitchen, some or the other thing available for all taste of people.",Aparna K,/Profile/AparnaK657,,50
pauri-garhwal,There are no roads to this property. Pls donâ€™t waste your money. I checked in on 20th June 2018 and there is no option to go. We are stuck here as we can not drive by ourself. You have to go through off roading. Car might get stuck somwhere and your chasis might brokedown. Food is pathetic as a local person will make food at upstairs. Chicken was half cooked. Best of luck if u still come here. ,umang b,/Profile/umangb46,,10
