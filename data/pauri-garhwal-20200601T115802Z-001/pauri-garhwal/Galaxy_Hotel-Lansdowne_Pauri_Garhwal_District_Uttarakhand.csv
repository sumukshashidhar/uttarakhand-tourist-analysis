pauri-garhwal,Its the first time we booked a hotel instantly and we were fooled. The owner charged double the price and facility were very poor. there were spider webs behind the curtains. there was stinking drain facing the window. We requested for white bedsheet and clean quilt but could not get it.   We asked for housekeeping to clean the room but the owner every time made excuses and we had to stay in the dirty room for two nights. A hell of experience,sapna a,/Profile/558sapnaa,"Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, India",20
