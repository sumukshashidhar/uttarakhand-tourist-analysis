pauri-garhwal,"This time I was planning to explore some different location & reached Lansdowne ! Got no accommodation there & finally reached this resort. Its more of family run accommodation for the travelers and been enjoyed by everyone whosoever loves the nature and the village life. The owners family has a kitchen (very homely feel). They will cook fresh at site, everything you ask for. Morning time the breakfast with the locals & natural ambiance is delight. Would recommend this place to the one who loves the nature & respect local people & food.",Kulvinder S,/Profile/dgm2017,"New Delhi, India",50
pauri-garhwal,"Location is quite good. You get the nearest point to the valley and you can walk down to the valley and forests easily, although not advisable due to wild animals. Food is awesome and cheap, you will feel like at home.  The rooms are old fashioned but neat and decent. The owner is a local and he is very friendly. Not very expensive. And yes, they had arrangements for bonfire too.",Manish D,/Profile/770manishd,,50
pauri-garhwal,Jai hari jungle resort is hidden away from prying eyes. The best part is very few people know about it. Yet it remains fully occupied on most of the weekends. Owner/Caretaker is a nice person and Food is almost like ghar ka khana. View is something which needs to be seen. Definitely better than any fancy resort in Lansdowne.  Very basic infrastructure yet comforting.,Yogesh T,/Profile/789yogesht,"New Delhi, India",50
pauri-garhwal,"I loved this hotel for it's location, and the home like food. It's not situated in a busy market on a main road. So if one is looking for a peace 24 hours, then this is the place to be. Market is only ten minutes drive away, and taxis are available all the time. And their food is so delicious, you really won't miss 'Ghar ka khana'. Their service is amazing.",Saumya S,/Profile/SaumyaS200,,50
