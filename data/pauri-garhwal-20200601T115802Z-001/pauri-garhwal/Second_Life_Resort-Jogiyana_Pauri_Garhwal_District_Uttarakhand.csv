Newly built cottages with traditional hut feel are just awesome to look at and live in !!",GunjanGuptaBJP,/Profile/GunjanGuptaBJP,,40
pauri-garhwal,"one must visit camps for desi feel and not for luxury. basic amenities and food was excellent, enjoyed bonfire. a perfect getaway from city life to a peaceful and nature's lap.   best cottage in my budget I could find anywhere in Rishikesh.  staff was very cordial and strict about self service concept. even though helped us a lot for evening snacks service.  all the best.  great deal in budget",Gagan A,/Profile/Quest587902,,40
pauri-garhwal,"Worst experience.Huge difference in the pictures shared and the condition of resort on site.Cows and Dogs roaming inside,open area not maintained.Pictures shared with me had green garden ,here it was dusty. Condition of super luxury rooms is horrible.They have put mattress on the concrete structure.Floor of this room was broken.Swimming pool was really very very dirty.Not just the water which had insects but the floor was black too. Poor room service with no intercom and the kitchen is far.You need to shout or walk all the way to kitchen for any need as the network is not available to make a call to the manager.All in all a very poorly maintained so called resort not recommended for family gathering .

pauri-garhwal,Me and my family went to this resort in Rishikesh for a weekend getaway and it was literally the perfect place as far as we could imagine.

pauri-garhwal,"As excited we were to stay in a camp, all our excitement went into drain the moment we stepped in this camp. First of all it's so far from the main river and city. It took us more than 1 hour to figure out the location but on website it was mentioned very conveniently located. Secondly it is not maintained very well. The kitchen and food area was not even close to be called clean. Their sales manager Mr Ashish Rawat and property manager Mr nitin were very cordial over the call. But since we decided to not to stay put in this resort and we had done full advance payment we requested them to refund atleast half amount. But all in vain, initially they agreed to refund some amount but even after multiple follow up calls we have got no response. In short it's a horrible place to stay.",shipravjain,/Profile/shipravjain,,10
pauri-garhwal,"I visited this resort in July, 16 for one night. The resort was located very far from the main city and it took around 1/2hr to reach there from the city. The rafting and stay package was provided for a decent price of 1200/- per person including lunch, dinner and breakfast. The resort has eco tents which are quite comfortable... The food tastewise was amazing.. In the evening there was an arrangement of bonfire along with good food and music.. overall a must visit place....",Vikas G,/Profile/VikasG68,,50

I booked a package for rafting plus camping,  and they offered my it for a very good price.  Just take a note if you are not traveling with you own  vehicle you will have to pay a good amount of money in transportation form rishikesh to camp.  Otherwise there is no issue with this.  Food is good and swimming pool adds charm to this beautiful place. ",Abhishek A,/Profile/abhisheka557,,50
pauri-garhwal,"I visited the camp in June and the camp is located away from the main Ganga river. You will see a small river stream by the camp side which you can cross easily as it has only ankle deep water. The camp has good options of sports as it has badminton, volleyball, cricket, football however there is no adventures activity in the camp. The only adventure you will feel is when you visit the camp from the main road as you have to trek down the hill to reach the resort. The camp is not very big and has almost 10 tents. The camps are good with attach bathroom. The camps are fitted with the standing fans and you have electric sockets to charge your phone also. You will also see a small pool in the middle which is also a plus point as it has Ganga river water in it. The food is good as",Rahul Sharma,/Profile/sharmarahul89,"New Delhi, India",30
pauri-garhwal,"Well what shld I say everything has some positives and some negatives . So let's start with the positives: pretty large area with swimming pool,where u can play badminton ,volleyball. Food was decent enough ,but they shld start dinner in time in our case dinner was served after 10:30 PM. Then there was a DJ that played music that people can enjoy. Gud place for corporate get togethers. And if u want a camp with attached washrooms they do provide those too.The best part was the owners pet dog Sherry he was so cute. Negative points : very far from shivpuri,u keep on going and going but this place never comes. No river around it,they don't provide transport facilities to commute so if u don't have ur own conveyance then it's not possible to roam around .

I have visited so many camp in Rishikesh, but main thing you can get here that is peaceful, very close to nature and fantastic food which you will not get at all beach camp nearby Sivpuri. This is located at Jogiyana village, the area is very peaceful. The all staff of the camp is very friendly & helpful. All food provided by the camp is awesome & hygienic. You can walk all around the camp/village & can see loot of unknown bird & peacock, also you walk over the small hilly river which will make your mind fresh.

pauri-garhwal,"We stayed here as part of our team outing. The place has decent tents (2 categories) and is right on banks of the river. They have all necessary items for a camping adventure. Mobile signal can be weak - so do not depend on it. Carry mobile power bank chargers. Adequate arrangements were made for meals (somewhat rustic, but that's what you look for at a camp). There are dry toilets - so carry tissues and sanitisers.",indiavoyager,/Profile/indiavoyager,"New Delhi, India",40

pauri-garhwal,"Second life resort is an amazing property enclosed within lush greenery and on the banks of a tributary of river Ganga. I visited here with eight friends in start of November 2013. Personally, this is the best time to visit Rishikesh as its least crowded which eventually leads to better hospitality and more peace of mind. Patna Waterfalls are nearby, around 5 km, is a must visit spot. It involves a steep trek of 2.5 km (one side) which is a bit tiring if you are not used to physical work but its totally worth it. You will realize that once you reach at the top and have the beautiful view of waterfall pleasing your eyes :).

pauri-garhwal,"Its has everything that you would expect from a tent accommodation- attached clean bathroom and WC, clean rooms, water flowing next to your tent, mountains, forest & good food. This hotel was recommended by a friend and it surely didn't disappoint us. The resort is placed very close to Jumping heights so your dose of adventure is also very close by. They also arrange a campfire in the evening and provide delicious snacks. They also arranged rafting for us and it was fun.  Now coming to the couple of downsides of the resort since its located in Rajaji National Park you cant be out till late. The gate of the park(about 8-10 kms away from the resort) closes at 8pm I guess and you have to be inside the gate by then.

You have to make all the right decisions otherwise you are going to sulk for another year before you can get away from work for a break. :)  And we made one hell of a decision when I along with my friends decided to visit Second Life Resort for a reunion. It is a perfect holiday destination providing an excellent mix of relaxation with adventure to nourish your soul back to health (which probably has been sucked out in the corporate world).  We were a group of five, all in our mid twenties, looking for some time away from the maddening city crowd. We wanted to enjoy but with a peaceful mind and that is exactly what we got.

There are lots of leisure and adventure activities which someone can fully indulge into completely besides the white water rafting. Rock climbing and trackking are some of the activities which give genuine and nature’s taste to the visitors, Jungle walk, bird watching, natural and wild life photography and angling are some of the other activities which the visitors can explore and have fun and excitement as they set their plan to visit the Secondlife Resort.

The common area is very close  by the executive rooms..so please dont opt for it. You will be listening to blaring music till 11:00PM if you are looking for a quite getaway. Also, if Ms Suhaani promises you that rafting starts at 8:30 AM in the morning..beware..it will not start before 12:30 PM ...also dont expect much for breakfast and lunch....There s no scenic beauty near the camp...thin stream of dried river with some pebbles...if you are looking for white water rafting experience please DONT go to SECOND LIFE RESORT...it will take away remote",wanderlust0091,/Profile/wanderlust0091,"New Delhi, India",10

For all that and more, one first has to find the sign which tells you of its location (there is one sign-board & that too hidden behind another). The food would be a welcome change, if you love the dishes they serve you in hospitals..... Evening snacks is cold oil drenched pakoras, and that too is served just before dinner.  Co-ordination between the rafting bit and the resort is nil.......as they do not have their own rafts; and they have no staff that accompanies you to the point where there is a supposed pick up arranged (again supposedly) to take you for rafting.

Next to a river bed that has less water than the main Ganga river and between majestic foot hills of himalayas...WoW. The location was good for us as we had small children and we could be a little less worried about the children falling in to the river all the time. Service: Very personalized service, the staff im mostly local so you get a feel of a farm house at times. Food: Nothing like a hotel although is very close to home cooked food.
