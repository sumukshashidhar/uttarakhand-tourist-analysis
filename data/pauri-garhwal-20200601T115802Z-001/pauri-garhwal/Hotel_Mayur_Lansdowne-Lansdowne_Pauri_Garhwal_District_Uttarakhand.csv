pauri-garhwal,"I was travelling solo and want to stay in a budget hotel in main market area, so chose this place in Lansdowne. Other high-end bigger properties are few km before the city centre and may be better for a family or couple.   The double bed room and washroom were clean and of average size with proper ventilation. The interior and amenities were very basic - an old TV, chair, small almirah, towel, one soap, etc. They don't have own parking space but vehicles can be parked in front of their property which seems safe. The entry is through a narrow stair case opening on the main road.  The restaurant is on the ground floor with entry entirely separate from the hotel, it has basic meals and snacks with a small sweet shop also. The food is OK and service is quick.",Arjit Mani Tripathi,/Profile/ArjitManiT,"New Delhi, India",30

We stayed in room 107 & 108 and found the rooms OK. However, it became very noisy in the night due to youngsters staying in the opposite room 106.We did not complain the first night but told the waiter on the second night.

pauri-garhwal,Lansdowne is a quiet and peaceful place mainly due to the military presence in the area - there are quite a few retired army officials residing.  Me and my friends went on a road trip from Delhi to Lansdowne - 250 kms around - covered in less than 7 hours with various food and toilet breaks.  We went there in the month of September - weather is pleasant - lil hot in the noon and cold in the night.  There are few things to do -  1. Tip-top view - ideally go early morning or around sun set.  2. Small Lake is famous for its boating and peaceful surrounding.  3. On the way down - there is a small stream - where people can do picnic - cook something and lie down in the water.   I believe it's a good place for a weekend getaway.

pauri-garhwal,Hotel Mayur is located right at centre of Gandhi chowk which makes commuting from here very affordable. We took a economical room for 3 which cost us INR 1700 per night. The room was ok. We did not find the food from this hotel good. the owner of the hotel is bit arrogant as he knows he provides the room at the best possible price. As per previous reviews here we tried to negotiate but that did not happen. The view from the room was also not good and there was a constant stench from backside of hotel.

Well its not an alcoholic drink, but just names so. Worth a try, if you haven't had it before. The price is very decent.  For the non-veg foodies, only option available here is egg curry/bhujji.
