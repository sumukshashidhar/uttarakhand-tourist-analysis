pauri-garhwal,One of the biggest beaches on river ganga. The stay is comfortable. The food is good. The staff is warm and friendly and rafting guides are good. The costing is a bit on the higher side compared to the offerings. ,whistlingnomads,/Profile/whistlingnomads,"Chandigarh, India",40
pauri-garhwal,"The outing was arranged by our company. It's a nice property located in white sand of River Ganga. The arrangements were good except the dry pit washrooms which were not clean. In spite of no power, we never felt it's need. Rafting experience was too good. You will love it if you are adventurous and love the stay in nature. Staff is cooperative.Food is good.",Sagar Z,/Profile/437sagarz,"Pune, India",40
pauri-garhwal,"A very nice, budget friendly stay in the lap of nature in Rishikesh! We stayed in tents for 2 nights and 3 days there. Amazing hospitality. Various activities like famous River rafting, Rappelling and cliff jumping conducted by Aspen with full safety and security . On the top of it, we also enjoyed DJ night, some light sports and calm stay and off course good food!  ",Devaynik,/Profile/Devaynik,"Pune, India",50

pauri-garhwal,"Hi all, Rafting is not for once it's an addiction.. So be ware;). Sharing my reviews for 5 elements.. The ambience was breathtaking beside the sound of flowing water and natural scenery clubbed with 2 mounts. staff they are very very linient.. They wont deny you for anything unless they don't have it.. Food was unbelievably good at such a place with low big setups of kitchen.. Though food was fresh and hygenic.. Had loads of fun !!",AnDyizhere,/Profile/AnDyizhere,,40
pauri-garhwal,"We went for a impromto visit to rishikesh. Camp five element exceeded our expectation . The beach was the largest and cleanest in that area . The bridge to reach the beach was a experience in itself . The food was awesome with a lot of variety and healthy options . The staff was very polite, prompt and made you feel secure .The rafting experience was amazing . They also had a off road secure parking spots .Gonna come back for more .",Shalinikatra,/Profile/Shalinikatra,,50
pauri-garhwal,The place is awesome- the service is excellent- the food is yummy - the rafting is rocking!!! We loved the Barbeque and the Bonfire... All this adding up to making our trip phenomenal and the entire experience truly memorable.... Three cheers for Camp 5 Elements...,MansiVa,/Profile/MansiVa,,50
pauri-garhwal,The place was jus mesmerising. Food was really nice as well. The location of the camp site was mind blowing. Though the baths were not attrached to the tent but they were extremely clean and neat. The adventure was just great with all safety measures. The over looking Ganga from the tents is something you could never want to miss out. The bornfire and barbaque added up the the experience. The staff was super cordial and helpful. Overall an experience of lifetime at the camp site,nikita t,/Profile/nikitat251,,50
pauri-garhwal,"When we reached this place - the view was stunning . The white sands and the river were so beautiful and refreshing that it cannot be described in words . The tents were basic and very close to the river but were not even close to luxury .  The service was pathetic . We had to constantly speak to our contact in delhi to get basic things done and to have what was promised to us as a part of the package .  Our rafting which was to happen on the day we arrived was casually postponed ; the meals served were cold at times ( although there was a lot of variety in breakfast etc.) . We had to literally fight for the bon fire which was a part of the deal.  However , both the bonfire and the rafting experiences are unforgettable ! we had a great time due to the natural setting and sheer",Traptika C,/Profile/traptikac,,20
pauri-garhwal,"We stated in Camp 5 elements for 1 night i.e from  12.04.2014 to 13.04.2014. The stay was pathetic and was below average. Services which were promised were not seen at all.  1. Food was pathetic 2. Washroom (Dry Pit) were not at all clean. 3. Staff was rude. 4. Around 35 KM from Rishikesh 5. No lights/Power backup. Even cant charge Mobile Phones. 6. One has to walk for around 800 mtrs to 1 KM to reach camp from main road. 7. Expensive, Charged 2500/- PP for such pathetic services. Others in nearby area were charging Rs. 1800- Rs. 2200(including 26 KM rafting) with much better location and services.  In short Nothing was good apart from rafting. Overall Experience was worst in Camp 5 Element.",pulkitchadha,/Profile/pulkitchadha,"New Delhi, India",10
pauri-garhwal,"Ok...first thing's first...it is NOT a luxury camp. But then again, who wants luxury in pure nature. We were a group of 19 and had 10 tents booked. Although I can't recall any of the the washrooms as the one shown in the pic here on T.A. The camp is about 3.5 kms further ahead from byasi  and approx. 45 mins from Shivpuri. It is a beautiful camp, absolutely away from hustle bustle of life. Many pros, to name a few - from where you get down on road, a walk downhill of about 10 mins to the camp which is across the river. This crossing of bridge itself is an experience (having a bird's eye view of the camp). The staff is very helpful and polite. White sand beach and is stretched perfectly to entertain a group of 50 easily. Food prep.top class. we were amazed to get a typical",ashwatdudhwal,/Profile/ashwatdudhwal,"New Delhi, India",40
pauri-garhwal,"we (a group of 7) stayed at Camp 5 elements, Rishikesh on 30 November – 1 December 2013.     The stay was nothing like we had been promised.  We were charged Rs. 3,200 per person for this trip and had been promised luxury, none of which was provided.  A clear case of mis-selling on part of our point of contact – Ms. Tanupriya.   On lodging a complaint with Ms. Tanupriya and Mr. Yadav, no action was taken, they even chose to not answer our calls or get back.  In fact, Ms. Tanupriya, losing all ground of hospitality and after completely ruining our trip, even asked us to leave the camp if wanted a refund for the mis-selling.     The following had been promised on the website/ e-mails/ telephone conversations:   •         Attached bath – this was written on the website.

pauri-garhwal,Wonderful camp by the river Ganga (Ganges). Really remote and serene environment. Really quiet except for the odd lorry hooting from the road far above. Took almost 6hrs by rail and bus from Delhi but was well worth the trip in the end.  Only downside was menu which was entirely Indian. Had to eat bread and omelette the entire stay. White water rafting and rappelling available from the camp as bolt ons. Wonderful suspension bridge is the only way to get down to the camp from the road.,charlesboham,/Profile/charlesboham,"Lagos, Nigeria",50
pauri-garhwal,"Ahh, the place was simply super. stayed for 3 nights and it was a completely overwhelming experience. everything was simply amazing. the view, the tents, the hospitality, the staff was too good and supportive. would recommend the same to my friends and colleagues and would come back again if time permits. not to miss is the evening singing with the owner Ratan Aswal.",kamlesb,/Profile/kamlesb,"Jaipur, India",50
pauri-garhwal,"We planned an official trip to Rishikesh with 20 team mates for 02 nights. It’s a process of our organization to go for such team building exercises every year, this was my 4th visit to Rishikesh with the team and believe me It was the best camping experience I have ever had. The campsite is equipped with 5 star facilities. The tour guide, Ashish, was very knowledgeable, and made sure we had an excellent time. This was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience for all of us. We reached there at night around 08 PM and the drive through rough road (10 km approx) was amazing.    It was a very well organized trip. When I contacted Leisure Hotels corporate office at Delhi to ask questions the staff were always polite and helpful. They tried their best to meet all our expectations.

pauri-garhwal,"The closest white sand beach near Delhi. Can it get better than that? We have been to camp 5 elements 3 times. The service is good, so is the food. We went rafting the first time but could not go the second time as we were travelling with our two little ones. So it was the white sand beach for us. Beautiful spot tough a little too far away from Rishikesh...worth it !!!",Parineeta P,/Profile/ParineetaP,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",40
pauri-garhwal,"I had visited Rishikesh for couple of days to enjoy camping and rafting. It was an amazing experience and planned very well with my interest in isolated places. Although we travelled by road, I would suggest planning a trip via rail as there are many options. Also, after rafting, your journey back home is much more relaxing in a sleeper train than a cab. I stayed at Sinthali village (Bayasi) which is about 31 Kms from Rishikesh. I chose Adventure Links camp there and I have to say they were simply amazing. The camps are connected via a suspension bridge and your mood is set on arrival when you walk/trek/climb (800 Mts) from one mountain to another and finally reach the camp. We were welcomed by a very courteous and simple staff which is extremely co-operative and very polite. ",TarunTrehan,/Profile/TarunTrehan,"New Delhi, India",50
pauri-garhwal,"One of the most beautiful spots in Rishikesh. The camp has the a huge beach and has its exclusivity since, its on the other side of the river. The rooms are basic with no jazz, yet its comfortable.",5hraddha,/Profile/5hraddha,"New Delhi, India",40
pauri-garhwal,"If you looking for some adventure then this is the place for you. It is in the middle of no-where literally.  Cut off from the world and dont expect to have your mobile network working here. You wake up surrounded by the hills and the white sand under your feet and river Ganga flowing right next to you. In the night you can hear the water gushing past and they light small bon fires around the camp. They arrange kayaking, white water rafting, rappling, etc. Word of caution: If you are looking for luxuries then please do not stay here. This is for the nature and adventure lovers. Asfor me, I loved it...would certainly re-visit and recommend!",UVed,/Profile/UVed,Mumbai,40
pauri-garhwal,"Located on the banks of the Ganges, guests are accommodated in luxurious tents which come fitted baths and other basic comforts. Meals are laid at a place overlooking the river and you have a choice of Indian, Mughlai, Chinese and Continental. They even organize activities like trekking. it was good fun with family and I alway prefer to go again at this place",TiyaMathuria,/Profile/TiyaMathuria,Ghaziabad,40
pauri-garhwal,"The camp is quiet a walk from the main road . The phone number given was not working . Having stayed in tents in Rajasthan ,we were expecting better tents .Some of them were torn and stinking . We traveled in end of march and the afternoons were unbearable hot with no fans . To top it there were flies to irritate you .  Bad stinking loos and a general lack of hygiene prevails the place . we had to stay for two days having prepaid our stay . The only saving grace was the cool evenings and the half decent food  .  Best avoided or stay for one day if you ant to experience camping on the Ganga.",Vikram Gupta,/Profile/vikramg1122,"Mumbai, India",20

pauri-garhwal,"We went for a rafting trip amongst colleagues and had great fun here. They have grwt camping facilities with each tent having its own loo. Very competent instructors and had great fun in two days of rafting. They encourage the visitor to have fun and jump ino the river during rafting so as to have a fabulous experience. the big surprise was that for a camp, the food was very good, hot freah and a nice spread. the evenings sitting outside the tent looking at the stars and hearing the river gushing below is a great feeling. highly recommended for all.",Mayukh,/Profile/Mayukh,"New Delhi, India",50
pauri-garhwal,"I stayed in this camp for 2 nights. It is beautifully located off the banks of the Ganges. You have to take a raft across the banks to stay here. Once you are here, you are in a different world. Beach volleyball, adventure trips. The rafting tours were great. The people at the camp were helpful and nice. The food was also quite good. There is an issue with the camp in terms of bookings and over bookings, but you have to stay there for a night or talk to the hotel directly to make sure you get the best camps onsite. They also have a nice massage center also on the property.  The prices here vary depending on when you book the property. Thats the only negative that I found out about the property, when we talked to others who were in the camp.",DoosraGoogly,/Profile/DoosraGoogly,"Fort Lauderdale, Florida",40
pauri-garhwal,"The 5 Elements Camp, although seasonal, as compared with the other offerings of tents on the banks of the Ganges near Shivpuri (past Hrishikesh) is superior in both comfort and luxury. BTW this is the only campsite that we saw that had attached bathrooms to the tents with running hot and cold water. The amenities dont make you feel like you are roughing the outdoors while at the same time enjoying relaxing comforts that the Camp provides 24x7. The Leisure Hotels group has certainly found a niche in the upscale white water rafting adventurers market where those who are willing to spend are given all comforts.

We were served lunch immediately which was as basic as Dhaba food.I was expecting a lot from Leisure hotels.   The day went away quickly doing the various activities like rock climbing , beach volleyball,  badminton at the camp.The evening bonfire bought a sudden chill in the air.
