pauri-garhwal,"I checked in to Alpine Resorts yesterday for a Night stay. The resort to my surprise was a newly built property with a great view of the hills.  2nd and above level will give u a very picturesque view. Even you can see the sunrise from your room. Food was delicious and served hot. Service and coordination needs improvement, can be done with a little more time. Thanks Team Alpine for making my stay wonderful.",Ishaan Mathur,/Profile/mathurishaan,,50
pauri-garhwal,"I stayed in this hotel for 1 night. This is around 4 km from the Lansdowne town center. And believe me there is no need to take a hotel in town center. As there is nothing to do in Lansdowne town center.  Food:5/5:  Awesome food, Nice options in Breakfast. Taste and portion of food they are serving extraordinary in such a less price.   Location: 4/5: Just after crossing the Lansdown Cantt entrytoll. So be aware that there are some hotels which are before Toll. So everyday a charge of Rs.100 you need to pay to go to Lansdown. This is after toll, so need to pay only once, first day. Picturesque beauty and views from this hotel.   Service:4/5:  Since Lansdowne is a cantt area, this is less commercialized. So there are no good hotels/ resorts in there. This is the best hotel. There",Rahul K,/Profile/rahulk30062019,"Noida, India",50

pauri-garhwal,We visited LANSDOWN in the month of November when Delhi is suffering from pollution. We stayed in Alpine hotel for 02 Nights. Hotel is located at very good location more over it is east facing so as soon as sun rises in the morning sun rays directly comes in all the rooms which is very refreshing.

pauri-garhwal,"Undoubtedly the property is beautiful at prime location with a mesmerising view of deep valley and tall pine trees. However, my experience was very dreadful. Reasons:  1. No security - At their Saturday DJ night , one person got high and created nuisance the whole night. Continuous tapping the door, screaming, stripping and what not!! We could not just get out of our room in fear. Even after complaining thrice to reception no security guard was sent. Receptionist just said we cant do anything those are our guest. Sigh, we were also guests and that too decent!!!  2. No Privacy - Rooms have very thin walls and one balcony is attached to other. Everything you say or do in your room is clearly audible and visible in next room. I caught bachelors staying in next door peeping in my",Escaping-neha,/Profile/Escapingneha,"Pattaya, Thailand",30

pauri-garhwal,It's a very dirty place... Literally! We checked in to the rooms to find that the toilets were dirty - basin was leaky - the lights weren't working and the rooms were dark. Towels had stains. Cups n glasses were dust covered. Balconies were unclean n had coffee stains - which looked like blood n was really scary. The staff is so untrained - you need to write down your own orders - you need to chase them to get things - the tiny bowl of icecream is also half-filled. They are a mess. Hated the place. It totally ruined our holiday. A two- star hotel is much more hygienic.,VijayaSShetty,/Profile/VijayaSShetty,"Pune, India",10

pauri-garhwal,This was my 5th trip to Lansdowne and i mostly stay at Kasang Regency. It was booked this time so decided to stay at the Alpine Resort.  Pros 1. The interior of the room is good and it is big 2. The location of the hotel is also good and has great views.  Cons.  1. No internet connectivity. They say they has Wifi but it only connects in corridors and not inside the rooms. Also it was not working during our stay. 2. Food is average. In the Dinner time you can only order dishes which they have made in the buffet. Nothing else. Even then items get finished even when you have ordered in advance. 3. The staff is incompetent and uninterested.  In nutshell it is a great property but there is great room for improvement.,luckyishere123,/Profile/luckyishere123,"Faridabad, India",40

They helped us get milk even at odd hours and even arranged for early breakfast on the day of the check out cause we had to leave early. The location of the resort is the best part. It has breathtaking views that could engage you for hours. Only thing that can get better is that the buffet is quite restricted. And for a large group that has all meals in the hotel, the food got very repetitive. Food was very tasty and fresh though. All in all perfect experience.

The highlight of the trip was having breakfast at the resort's roof-top restaurant providing a breathtaking panoramic view. The view just filled you with a sense of calm and gratitude. The food tasted really good plus the staff is courteous and friendly. We spent 3 days exploring churches, temples and scenic points of Lansdowne.  Another day relaxing by indulging in spa and pool at Blue Pine Resort just 20 steps away. I believe they come under the same company.

pauri-garhwal,The resort is newly renovated and is nice with good services. Rooms are modern and big with all the amenities in place. The best part is the balcony from where you can have panoramic view of the valley. Food is good and on request they also prepared dishes of our choice. Staffs are cooperative and helpful and always attend to your requests. They also arrange DJ at night on rooftop which as per me should not be done because it spoils the atmosphere with loud music.
