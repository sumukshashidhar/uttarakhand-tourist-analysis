pauri-garhwal,"Awesome place to stay in lap of nature. More importantly, you will enjoy sumptuous home made food with equitable hospitality. Mr Negi and all people there have made our stay memorable. Only thing which they have to improve are the rooms, which can be a bit more tidier and entail better amenities. The one thing that gives this place an advantage is its proximity to nature and homely atmosphere provided by the owners. Must visit once to have a memorabilia.",Rohan S,/Profile/rohans437,"Noida, India",50
pauri-garhwal,"About My trip: I have visited this place in January, 2016 (No option to choose this while revewing). Month was cold but I must say the staff was never cold in their hospitality. When we reached we were given we given neat and tidy rooms as per our booking. We departed from their and went for sight seeing for full day and returned back in the evening. I was much more than delighted to view the sunset from the roof. It was peaceful and relaxing on the roof and once I had wish to stay there forever. Later staff arranged for the bonfire which we enjoyed late night. Even staff placed the buffet as per our convenience. I was lucky enough in the night to see the night with as many stars as i hadn't seen in the years. (Pics are uploaded). Next day we had no reason to go anywhere hence",famous201,/Profile/fam0us201,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
pauri-garhwal,"There are very less number of hotels in Lansdowne and that too is not worth the tariff they offer. But one has to make a choice. We stayed at Shri Gobind Highway motel which is 10km before Lansdowne. This motel is owned by a family who cooks fresh homemade food as per your order. The food and stay are pretty cheap. But be mindful that it is not a luxurious hotel and the expectations should match the price you pay. Basically, its kind of a home stay.",Himani C,/Profile/740himanic,"New Delhi, India",40

After wandering around for some time and rooms being refused to us, I figured out that they had rooms available but it was 12 kilometers away from me. I bugged them at first at around 3:30 am. They asked about our current location and told us that the hotel is 12 kilometers away. We called them again at around 5 am since we were not able to figure out the way. The helped us navigate to the hotel at that hour of the day. Finally we reached the hotel at 6 am sharp where we were welcomed nicely. I paid online via Goibibo as I was short on cash.   I was with my friend and we wanted to stargaze in the night. I asked them if the doors could be left open and gave them the reason.

pauri-garhwal,"As a solo female traveller, my maiden venture to Lansdowne and stay at the Shri Gobind Highway Motel could be a make or break as regards my future endeavours. Turns out, it is just the beginning of my trysts with solo travelling - attributed chiefly to Mr. Negi's pleasant hospitality. This homestay allayed my main concern going solo, that of security. Located in a village named hathniya (pali), about 15 kilometers from Lansdowne, it afforded me an experience of the rudimentary rural pahadi life. In hindsight, the peace and calm that I experienced exploring the many hillocks and brooks in the vicinity of of the homestay, made for a more memorable experience than my Lansdowne trek.

It was our (me & my fiancé) first hangout at Lansdowne, Initially we were confused & not confidant about this Motel, so we had planned to stay there just for a day. But this single day has changed its mood & extended itself to five days……..Credit goes to Lansdowne & especially to this place(motel).  The USP of this place is its own restaurant & kind of healthy-delicious recipes they offer….I bet it… its unbeatable against all other places food in Lansdowne.

Mr. Negi and his family has given such a nice gesture which we never expect from a hotel owners. Customized food of your choice with tawi roti and rice makes the journey so homely.   we requested for Music and they arranged a dance program.   One thing which i want to share that if you are expecting a five star treatment than please stay away from this hotel because you can get care, attachment & everything except the stupid life of metros.   so guys I am preparing for next trip in the same hotel.

pauri-garhwal,"Practical tips-  1. The location is great if you want to take one of the many paths that lead into the pine forests. The walks are very scenic, especially in the early mornings and evenings.  2. It costs about 20 bucks/person to get a shared cab/bus to Gumkhal. You can get another vehicle to Lansdowne from there. The entire trip would take you about an hour if you are relying only on public transport, much less if you have your own vehicle.  3. Mr. Negi (the owner/host) is very helpful. He will help you plan your trip.  4. The sheets & towels aren't the cleanest, so if you are picky, carry your own.  5. The food is basic, homely fare. It is fed with great joy and that makes it all the more tasty.",Nishit7,/Profile/Nishit7,India,30

The location is a little faraway except if you are a nature walker and like to go into pine forests for long strolls. Hotel is an absolute budget one as rooms are very small and old. Bathrooms are pathetic. Food as per previous reviews is amazing but my experience wasn't so, though it wasn't bad but since I had high expectations from last reviews so was disappointed.You can also hear noises from the passing by vehicles on highway and adjacent rooms.

pauri-garhwal,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 days. Initially we were hesitant, given its distance of about 12-13 km from the main lansdowne town...but I would say locationwise, it would be one of the best places to stay... When you plan to spend time in nature, why would you want to stay within the city with lots of disturbances!!! The distance from the town centre is about 15-20 mins only.. The hospitality of the Negi family is wonderful. They cook food as per your order and taste. It was almost like staying in a family. Though the amenities in the Motel were only very basic. Children enjoyed the stay a lot. We went climbing over hills, which is adjacent to the hotel. Evening are very peaceful!! Overall a wonderful stay!!",skpandeysk,/Profile/skpandeysk,"Noida, India",40

But we found that hotel is ideally located not very far from Lansdowne. In fact I will say its located close to the environment tourists want to enjoy in Lansdowne, that is the nature. Rooms are basic and simple; and you need rooms only to sleep, the real pleasure is outside. you can go to the rooftop and enjoy the beauty of hills. the best part of our stay was food prepared by the Negi family. Its sumptuous and not very costly. All staff and Negi family were always available for any help. They were all courteous.

Away from the hustle-bustle of the city, located in the mid of nature and very well connected through road.  Best was the hospitality of the staff & the food which they served. Be it the yummy breakfast or the tasty lunch, Mouth watering pakoras as an evening snack and super awesome chicken delicacy in the dinner, everything was amazingly tasty. Me being nature lover and foodie,Shri Gobind Highway Motel was no less then a treat to stay. Kudos to the entire staff for the way they treat their customers. It was like home away from home.

pauri-garhwal,We were few friends travelled last year and it was pretty good and relaxing.  Best part was the location as well as the owner including the supporting staff of the hotel. They treated us like a family member and were very coperative. Really good to see the ambience. You can relax and go for a short walk to the forest which just infront of the hotel.  The food was very fresh and delicious cooked in a homely environment. I can still remember the flavor of chiken curry as well as chilli chicken.  The owner himself helped us in trekking to neary places as well as to the village.   In short I would recommed to you to stay at this place if you are travelling to Lansdowne.

Nested right across the valley with amazing views of both the curvaceous highway and the hills, this hotel is a treat to stay!!   The staff treats you like a family and ""genuinely"" is interested in your needs and comfort. Me and my friend were more than ecstatic b their courtesy and service. Located10 Km from Lansdowne, this hotel is no less than any. Finger licking chicken curry and a nice place for bonfire makes it worth a while.   Highly recommended for staying.

The place is surrounded by  trees. Just trek a few meters to the opposite hill to relax and enjoy the sound of the wind blowing through the trees. You can also trek down to a nearby village which has properly carved route that even children can trek easily. There is a plain area near the village where you can spend some time and can even plan a picnic.  You can also plan a bone-fire at the hotel itself.
