pauri-garhwal,"We booked a deluxe room, but were totally unsatisfied. There are only 3 good rooms in this resort with glass balconies. Luckily, one of them was available as I visited there on weekday. We paid some amount extra and upgraded our room. The views are great from balcony due as its glass wall that does not hinder any view. Food was overall good. The major sore point in this resort is it lies at a very low height. Due to this, temperate difference at its location and in Lansdowne is considerable. About 5 degree celsius. I visited in October 2nd week. Weather was comfortable during my stay.",Vipin A,/Profile/vipinaggarwal1,,40

pauri-garhwal,"Even though our trip was really short but the hospitality was amazing. However it's a bit far off from lansdowne (22km) but you should atleast spend some time here.  The leisure activities, mearby river will keep you occupied.  The food was amazing as well.  Above all the prices are very much within the pocket. Must stay place.",rhythm b,/Profile/rhythmb2019,,50
pauri-garhwal,I have visited there for one day in the month of june. It's an awesome place to stay around Lansdowne. It's a river side resort which give it a eye-catching experience and you can play in river as water is not too much. Plenty of sports options are available in the resorts. Staff is very cordial they provide us awesome service experience. Last and not least I give special thanks to manager Mr. Negi who provide us each n every help which we want. So will like to recommend this resort in that area,Anshul agarwal,/Profile/Anshulgzb,,50

pauri-garhwal,"SB Mount resorts is nested between the hills just when the climb to Lansdowne begins and is located at a lower altitude than Lansdowne. It is a very good property with decently furnished rooms. However the approach to the resort is by way of climbing down steps, crossing a foot bridge and then again climbing up so difficult for people with disability to approach. Another disadvantage is the distance from the main Lansdowne which is about 20 km from this resort.  Otherwise the staff and the other facilities are very good and a simple but filling buffet breakfast. Advise: Please check rates on different websites or contact the Resort directly for better rates and deals",mohtaanup,/Profile/mohtaanup,Delhi,40
pauri-garhwal,"Best about this resort is its location; and the comfort and service alike! Rooms are really huge, comfy and well equipped. Newly constructed super deluxe rooms are extra-large spacious with all the amenities; and it has a unique extra bunk-bed on top of wash room which children enjoy the most. Ours too got excited spotting the bunk-bed and had great fun and restful sleep upstairs.   We were four families, and I must say SB Mount is a perfect place for a family outing. It’s on the Khoh riverside, so the moment you reach here, everyone just leaps into the pristine waters; the ladies try mermaid poses and children try to catch the tiny fishes, which were aplenty, and also give you the ticklish fish-pedicure!

It is good for someone who wants solitude, they are beside a natural stream - an added advantage, placed between unpolluted nature, 21 KM before Lansdown City. They have an area for parking beside road and it was good for me compared to some properties where parking needs you to know some tricks.

The service is sluggish but not too bad if you are on a holiday. The food choice is limited but very tasty. The staffs and the manager are very helpful and courteous. The disadvantage of this place is it is 20 km away from Lansdowne and no network connectivity. It is beside a tiny creek which hardly provides any view or entertainment. On the other side of the creek is the main road, so there is no chance of talking a walk after dark.  So this is an ideal place for people traveling in a big group who have really come for a holiday rather than tourism.

I have been to Landsdowne 3 times and I must say the quality of food served here is best.

There's also nothing spectacular there, provided you are not a first time visitor to hill region.

The rooms are fitted with AC, Tata SKy TV, and are tidy. Towels and bed linen are very clean. Overall the quality of stay and experience is very good and recommendable. This was my second visit to SB Mount Resort.  Some minor areas of improvement: 1. Enhancement in the quality of lighting in the rooms making it a bit brighter. Adding reading lamps would be a good idea. 2. The channels on Tata Sky contains few English channels; English movie and entertainment",BChatterji,/Profile/BChatterji,"Gurgaon, India",40

pauri-garhwal,Good place to stay. following are some merits and demerits of the resort:  merits:  1.food was good. 2. service was exceptional. 3. Very friendly staff. 4. Good location of resort.  Demerits:  1. No proper parking facility. 2. Rooms are overpriced for the type of resort it is. 3. Size of gysures are very small. if you are going to take bath after your roomy  you have to wait at least 40 minutes  coz it takes time to get water warm. It eats up your valuable time. 5. they will sell rooms with deluxe tag mentioning revere view and charge more and it is a big dhoka.,CAASHISH86,/Profile/CAASHISH86,"New Delhi, India",40

pauri-garhwal,I stayed in SB mount resort along with my husband and 10 month old baby when visiting Lansdowne. The resort has a rooms as well as tents and is situated on the banks on the Kho river. It's a great place to chill with either family or friends. The staff is very helpful and the food is very good. The resort lies at the valley below Lansdowne and to get a view of the town and the peaks you need to drive up to Lansdowne. Thus this is not a place for people who wish to stay in a place with view of the peaks. However for people looking for quiet and trickle of the river this is just right. ,Toshal S,/Profile/ToshalS,,50

Since there are quite a few reviews here for this place and all happen to be from *First Timers* who have rated it 5 Stars (that makes me wonder about veracity of this reviews) - let me break down some myths:  1.) Most Importantly, this place is *NOT* located anywhere in Lansdowne or in Mountains for that matter. SB Mount Resort is located in a village called *Fatehpur* that is 21 Kms from Lansdowne, and is around an hour of drive. So, for example - if you stay here for 2 nights and drive up to Lansdowne and visit local attractions like Bhulla Lake, Tarkeshwar (which is 35 Kms from Lansdowne) - you're looking at total driving of 40 Kms a day just to",folkpoet80,/Profile/folkpoet80,"Mountain View, California",30

pauri-garhwal,"If one is looking for a stay away from city's hustle bustle then this is the place. We travelled during first week of December in a group of four. Drive in the morning was as smooth as you would like, started at 5 am from Gurgaon and reached SB resort at 9.30 am with one break for tea around Nazibabad.   Resort is situated just next to stream of river which gives amazing views. Service was excellent, Mr Negi took care of our smallest of requests. Food was also good and arranged as per our requirement.  Overall, an excellent place to be for weekend break. Must visit for once and i am sure you will not stop yourself visiting again.

pauri-garhwal,"Starting with the telephonic conversation with Mr. Brij Dutt, the owner of this amazingly homely boutique property on the foothills of Lansdowne, to the warm hospitality of Mr. Negi, the property manager, and his ever-smiling friendly staff, to delicious food to well-appointed rooms to scenic settings among mountains and a free flowing small rivulet on front, we have had a delightful experience at S B Mount Resort!    I stayed with the extended family for a night.  Wish our schedule permitted us to extend our stay.  S B Mount is now on my list of places to visit more than once.   The property is conveniently located -- away from the madding crowds, yet not too far.  Situated just ~ 20 KMs before Lansdowne, it is ideal for weary travellers to drop anchors after road journey from",Neeraj G,/Profile/NeerajG255,,50

pauri-garhwal,"We went to the hills near Lansdowne for a long week. Unfortunately the hotel and the owner of the joint we had booked at were terrible. We decided to leave in 2 days. On the way down we saw S.B.Mount Resort on the banks of a stream at foot of the Corbett Hills just next to an old British Iron bridge. The stream separated the road from the resort. It was beautiful, peaceful, with a pretty lawn and bridge to cross the stream. The sound of the water rushing over the pebbles was what first got my attention. The resort is barely 2 km after Dugadda towards Lansdowne. We fell in love with the place. The landlady was so kind and warmhearted and her son, the owner, Brij Dutt was so friendly and helpful that we stayed all the rest of our holiday here. The rooms are excellent with all the",DhirenB,/Profile/DhirenB,"Shanghai, China",50
