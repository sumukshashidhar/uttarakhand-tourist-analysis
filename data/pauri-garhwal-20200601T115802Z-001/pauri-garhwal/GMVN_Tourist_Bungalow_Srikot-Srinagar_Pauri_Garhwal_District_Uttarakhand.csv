pauri-garhwal,"The TRH is well located on the High way to joshimath, very cooperative staff.. rooms are though old, well maintained by the staff.. I requested them to give a room on the back side away from main road, which they arranged, was a nice experience .. the mountain view front the hotel incredible.. You can have from the hotel restaurant or a good restaurant located across the road, are added advantage.. Only problem we faced was lack of parking space.. you have park your on the road side, though it's a common feature there.. Overall it's a very good experience for transit stay...",191smita,/Profile/191smita,"New Delhi, India",30
