pauri-garhwal,"Khirsu is a really tiny hamlet and this hotel is the only decent accomodation in Khirsu. The hotel is fairly basic and the food served here is more than just basic. We had arrived on the day of Holi and the hotel staff was kind enough to give us lunch. A point to remember, especially if you are travelling on Holi in Uttarakhand, eating remain shut during the day and fuel stations are shut from 9 am to about 4 pm. So take necessary precautions if you are travelling on day of Holi, in Uttarakhand. We had called the hotel staff, at Khirsu, in the morning and asked if they could keep lunch for us, to which they readily agreed. Mind you 10-15 years government hotels like GMVN and KMVN used to operate with skeletal staff during Holi, which did cause some discomfort to travellers.

The hotel has other options too like deluxe hut and deluxe rooms.Our room though a bit damp and without natural light was comfortable. Good quilts and clean sheets and pillows were provided. Room heater can be availed at extra charge. The bathroom was clean and with geyser facility. However the views from the hotel are its usp and provides almost 270 degrees of spectacular views including mountain peaks in the morning. The restaurant provides good fresh food though a bit expensive .Overall a very good hotel in this tiny hamlet,Sagnik Banerjee,/Profile/Sagnik94,"Kolkata, India",40

One can try Bharat Bhojanalaya,  near  entrance( approx 300 meters). View from Hotel Lawn is superb. On a clear day, one can see 180 degree mountain view.

The main building rooms are damp, avoid them. Go for the delux huts, which are spacious, clean.   There is water scarcity in Khirsu. You will get water (hot or cold) only between 6-9 am and from 6-8 p.m. So plan your arrival based on that.  The staffs are helpful. They inform you immediately whenever they start the water supply, or they have the food ready. That too in person. The food is tasty. I mainly stick to dal, veg dish and omlette.

pauri-garhwal,"We spent a couple of days in Khirsu in Oct 2012.No doubt about this place being beautiful,charming and an ideal place for unwinding yourself by gazing at the vast himalayan range but sorry to say GMVN Khirsu is not at all up to the mark. The rooms are fine (with no wardrobes),cottages looked good (we were discouraged to stay in cottages since two cottages use one single water tank). As a whole Khirsu has problem in running water which is understandable but the GMVN service is just pathetic.Neither do the staff respond to your basic needs (read drinking water,hot water) nor they are polite.If you just ignore these,still you are trapped since the food they prepare is just horrible.No non-veg.We were told that we need to order atleast 3-4 plates of chicken only then they can serve",Simi15,/Profile/Simi15,"Kolkata, India",20
pauri-garhwal,"A fantastic heavenly stay in the remote Himalayan village, Khirsu. Those who wish to spend some time in the midst of nature, this may be a perfect place for them. Only GMVN guest house is available here in this village. The rooms are fantastic. Cottages are also available, you will get mind-blowing view from the cottages. Fresh oxygen, nice environment and uninterrupted view of many peaks of Himalaya. The food quality is too good and surprisingly cheap. Non-vegetarian food also available. Very much neat and clean. No ice-cream parlour, no shopping mall, no continental restaurant and bar, only nature, chirping birds, lovely sunrise and sunset, pure drinking water, rain, cloud, rainbow, plenty of oxygen, pleasant temperature during summer, pine trees, gorgeous Himalayan view and",PrasunMondal,/Profile/PrasunMondal,"Mumbai, India",40
