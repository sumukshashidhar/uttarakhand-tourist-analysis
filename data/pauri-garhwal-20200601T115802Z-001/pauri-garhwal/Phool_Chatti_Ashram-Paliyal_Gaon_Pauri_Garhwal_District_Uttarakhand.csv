Teaching here is excellent,the schedule is really packed and helps you to unwind from the pressures of everyday living.  We had a big room with hot showers but some of the older rooms had elephant bath only. Oddly we really enjoyed the elephant bath and didn't bother using the showers.They are building new accommodation at the moment which should be open soon and all new rooms will  have hot showers. We found the meditation and chanting hard at first but soon got used to it. and quickly learned to enjoy it.

pauri-garhwal,"Recently I celebrated my birthday week at Phool Chatti Ashram . It was beautiful and life changing experience. Each day was full of energy, yoga, learning, lectures, discussion, chanting, satvik food, meditation, nature walk and unconditional love. I felt my inner light glow stronger and brighter. I also felt I was able to see the light in others as well. This shifted the way I interacted with people. I found that I loved more and judged less. I let go of things that didn’t serve me. This transformation gave me an enormous amount of happiness and energy.  ",Pankti Shah,/Profile/CrazyWanderer19,"Vadodara, India",50

First of all, this Ashram is perfect for beginners who are embarking on their spiritual journey. There is a lot of meditation, mindful walks, chanting and yoga throughout each day, which starts from 5.30am - 9pm.  It is a packed schedule, however you are not forced to participate in absolutely everything if you are unable to. I certainly didnt feel any pressure to attend everything as there were times I felt compelled to spend some alone time by the Ganga and purge some unprocessed emotions that would inevitably surface through the meditations and silence.

It was our first proper experience of the 'less western' view of yoga - meditating, breathing and chanting etc. At first I wasnt sure it was for me, but as the week went on I really loved it. It is a very full on day with little free time! We went to all the classes and were glad as sometimes it was something different! We did 2 classes of 'typical' yoga each day (3 hours in total) which was great. However there was almost no individual guidance during the sessions (there were 50 people on our course). There was also very little space as we were sandwiched in so at times we were hitting in to each other.

The room had old newspapers to cover the shelves and block out the light from the windows. No carpet just a concrete floor and bare lights which would cut out from time to time. It felt like a prison cell. When you add the silence and lack of social interaction with other residents it amounts to an extremely challenging experience. Although the  basic premise of the retreat works in the sense that there are benefits to silence and mindfulness I felt the state of the room showed such a lack of care that any spiritual benefit was down to me rather that the organisation.

The serene setting along the Ganga outside of Rishikesh really allowed me to detach from life's distractions (no internet, social media, or hustle and bustle of crowds) and focus on developing my yoga practice. Everyone who lives and works there is very kind and helpful if you need assistance with anything at all during the stay, especially the yoga instructor Lalita and the people who help out at meal time. The food is to die for, and facilities offer everything you need (basic but pleasant - what you look for in an ashram), and the natural setting is breathtaking. The intensive yoga program is particularly beneficial for those who are",alexis604,/Profile/alexis604,"Vancouver, Canada",50
pauri-garhwal,India is full of ashrams and after spending a week at Phool Chatti I can offer some cautions before signing up for this experience.   PROS: -tasty Indian meals  -beautiful setting along the Ganges River  -the teacher has some insights to share about spirituality  CONS: -impressively bad yoga instruction. I've studied yoga for 10 years and this was some of the worst instruction I've seen. There was no instruction on how to avoid injuries from yoga and some postures were far too advanced for beginners. I ended up ditching the classes to take yoga in the nearby town.   -the Hindu philosophy classes were unfocused. The teacher spent a good portion of one class talking about the foods she likes from different regions of India  -the main teacher Lolita strikes me as burnt out.

pauri-garhwal,"I attended the 7-day programme at Phool Chatti on November 4-10, 2014.  Overall it was an enriching experience and I would recommend that place, because of the following: 1) Great location: beautiful views of the Ganga & surrounding mountains, very quiet (ok, just a few honks could be heard from the road passing above), gorgeous & clean beach right in front, lovely fruit & vegetable gardens. 2) Decent accommodation: my room was simple but lovely, full of light, and the bathroom (which I ended up not having to share) was spacious and clean. The only thing is it gets quite windy at night and early morning so it can be a bit cold in the bedrooms & bathrooms which ""mosquito net windows"".

And this is a review long-overdue because procrastination is what I do the best... Well, first up, the yoga class was good, I actually learned a lot new things about yoga and because of this learning experience it's well worth the money...the program was designed to offer you different aspects of yoga, not only physical exercise, but also meditation, laughter yoga, etc. I liked the meditative walks, and equally enjoyed the beauty of Rishikesh itself. And speaking of location, the ashram is a far from everything which is kinda annoying, you need to take a taxi if you wanna go into town. And you don't even get cellphone connections.

First of all it depends what you are searching for.  If you want to get a good, quick introduction in ashram and yogi life, than it's ok. But if you go there to meditate, have a break of busy india and think more about you and your life and have a introduction then we are not so sure if you find your happiness there...  + the location is amazing (next to the ganga, out in the nature) + the rooms are nice, clean and bright and above all with moscitonets on doors and windows + there's hot water even in the morning + the programme is quite a full and tries to cover",Sofie144,/Profile/Sofie144,Delhi,30

The programme is forfilling physically, mentally and spiritually with something for everyone to really get into.   The food is the best I have had throughout the whole of India and many other guests said the same thing.

The entire experience was a dream come true and a step closer to how I feel we should be living. The ashram community were always smiling and helpful and the place has a very deep sense of peace. With the mighty Ganga outside your door and numerous walks to mystical waterfalls and mythical caves there is magic around every corner. This a very down to earth place which allows for deep immersion and exploration. The food is unforgettable and if you have the chance to engage with the Swamiji on any level, it is an experience you will not forget.

pauri-garhwal,"If you're experienced with yoga this is not the place to be. the yoga asana is verry simpel and the postures are not good explained. Phool chatti is mainly focused on Hindu traditions. So chanting is involved almost every hour of the day. For an introduction to meditation and the ashram life this is an interesting place. The 16-hour daily program made me very exhausted. The teacher was not friendly, social and flexibel. I'm sorry, I would not recommend it.",Anne-Esther,/Profile/Anne-Esther,"Voorburg, The Netherlands",20

The rooms were lovely:-) it was nice to constantly hear the sound of the river flowing while eating or laying in bed... I really had a great time at this ashram and l met some friends for life here... The yoga teacher lalita ji was very good... I do have one complaint the course was a little over booked!!!  It's not very fair on beginners who need to be corrected and guided when starting this course...   Also the course is 5 full days not 7 ... You start late afternoon on day one and finish Lunch  time day 7..  All in all a great experience and dipping in the Ganga everyday felt like dipping in medicine!! It felt great!!!,mrorganic1973,/Profile/mrorganic1973,ubud,50
pauri-garhwal,"One of my best experiences in India. I did the 10 day yoga retreat having moderate experience with yoga. The class was comprised of students who had never done a day of yoga, and those who had been teaching for years. At no point did anyone on this vast spectrum feel out of place. Lalita Ji, and Krissy Ji who run things are class acts; unlike most ashrams in Rishikesh the experience is not about the guru, the sadhu, or the baba, it is about you, the practitioner and your growth. It is challenging but incredibly meaningful - I highly recommend it.   Beyond the experience the grounds are beautiful, the food is outstanding and the facilities are well kept.",Acousticgs,/Profile/Acousticgs,,50

I was told (after I had payed), that I would not be welcome to join in any of the activities (yoga, meditation or worship) as I would disturb the rest of the group if I was seen to 'be leaving' after a few days. I was told that I was not allowed any communication with anyone else in the 7 day group. I found the american man (Randy) completely unfriendly,unwelcoming and egotistical.

Cons: The lifeless attitude in the program, not a big fan of the yoga teacher Lalita Ji, she is not good at correcting postures, and in her Asana classes. Actually, some of the postures she did incorrectly. I did not like the energy from Randy, the older american guy who is also a teacher he never smiles and likes to command at people.
