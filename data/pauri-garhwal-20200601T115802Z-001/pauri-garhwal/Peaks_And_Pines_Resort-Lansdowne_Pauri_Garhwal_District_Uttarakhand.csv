pauri-garhwal,"Truely amazing property with best hospitality. The food, ambience, hygiene, staff everything was up to the mark. The food was so delicious and fresh. The menu is nicely planned. The staff is so humbled and trained. Had a great time spent with family with awesome view of the valley from the room. Good hospitality and management with smiling faces all the time from all the employees.",Manoj Ahuja,/Profile/manoj25ahuja,,50
pauri-garhwal,This place does justice to its name. The moment one steps into the balcony all they can view is pine trees and peaks. This resort is fairly new. Few sections are still under construction. Even the room where we stayed had some electrical points which were incomplete. It is a decent place. We had a comfortable stay. The breakfast buffet was tasty and had quite a lot of options.  One thing I would like to highlight here is that the suite rooms are not valley facing. If you are looking for an exclusive valley facing room then suite room is not the one you should go for. ,Jaya Das,/Profile/JD2503,"Haryana, India",40

pauri-garhwal,"New property hardly 6 months old.... Approx 5 kms before the landsdowne town. Room are good in sizes, neat and clean with good scenic beauty from room. Food is also and can be customised as per the requirement. Staff is extremely helpful and cooperative. Special mention of Ms. Naina, who go beyond her limits to make it one of our memorable stay in the property. Definately recommended to visitors. Even recommended to do a bonfire on roof top which the hotel arrange at extra cost but every single penny is worth spending on the property. One small indoor games area but no pool, kids activity area and fitness club but still one of the good properties to stay.",PHD1905,/Profile/PHD1905,"New Delhi, India",40

Such a scenic view, nice and clean room, great service, it just made our visit more satisfying. The highlight is the view, which is so rejuvenating, so beautiful, one can't be able to take their eyes off. Food was good but lil expensive.

Manager  is extremely helpful and open to new ideas to improve  hotel.  Nice collection of indoor games,  like snooker table and all.  Good food.   Cons Just one,  when we visited that place then they were developing their property with a banquet hall and swimming pool, so the view from the window had construction view also.

pauri-garhwal,"Deal Traveler, Have been reading multiple 5 star feedback for this hotel , so just thought of sharing a more realistic experience based on my recent stay in 1st week of Oct 2019. We stayed for 3 days in 1st week of Oct '19. I too got carried away with 5 star feedbacks from fellow travelers for this hotel when I was booking hotel and had very high expectations when I reached there after a tiring drive of 6 hours, and expected a decent stay in the hotel also. The room was good, no doubt about it, had good views too but the our stay there was more happening for us to shadow the other features of the hotel.   Day 1: We were earlier allotted the room in 2nd floor, room was pretty decent, but our room was shifted to 1st floor after 3 hours since there was some maintenance work ( wood",Jitin_Nan,/Profile/Jitin_Nan,"New Delhi, India",30
