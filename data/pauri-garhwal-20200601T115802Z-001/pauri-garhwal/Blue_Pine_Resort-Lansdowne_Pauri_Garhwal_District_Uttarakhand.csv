pauri-garhwal,"Only one plus point is the view that you get from the rooms here.... that's it.... On the ground this is run by real arrogant staff.. customer service takes a back seat here.... Food can be best not written about.....they don't serve any thing at the room even if it is minute after the cutoff....There is a very good,low profile food joint 200 mtrs from this hotel which serves wholesome food and much recommend",Ramakrishnan R,/Profile/593ramakrishnanr,"Pune, India",10

pauri-garhwal,"Lansdowne is a great place to visit if you are looking forward to spend a weekend in solace.Maximum 2days would suffice to go around and enjoy.Network and internet connectivity is weak/nil.Blue Pine Resort experience is not good.. Management of the resort is poor..WiFi was mentioned in the deal but there is no internet in the resort and in the vicinity..Services ill managed, staff unprofessional, rooms with foul odour...Food of poor taste and quality... inadequate basic facilities. Though the resort is situated at a picturesque location...about 4kms from Lansdowne town.Road connectivity and vehicle availability to the town is good from the resort. Overall NOT recommended for solo,girls, family. You don't get what you pay for.No value for money.You have to work very hard to get",Excursion817153,/Profile/Excursion817153,,10

pauri-garhwal,"My family consisting of 3 members stayed here end of March ’18 for three days after completion of annual exams. It’s our first visit to Lansdowne.  We were welcomed by staff members with on arrival drinks.   The hotel is situated on the edge of the town; hence it is in a very peaceful and excellent location. Resort’s Tariff is also good. During our stay we enjoyed with swimming, using SPA as well as Gym. The restaurant area is very spacious and can accommodate more than 100 guests in one go.   We can view the mountains from the top of the Resort itself. We opted for third floor and rooms are vast, very neat and clean, well equipped and trained staff, they are willing to help out of the way where our trip to be pleasure.  The breakfast and dinner is mouth watering with varieties",kumguru,/Profile/kumguru,"Noida, India",50
