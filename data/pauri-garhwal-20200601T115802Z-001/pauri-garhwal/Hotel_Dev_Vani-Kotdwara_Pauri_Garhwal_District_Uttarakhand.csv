pauri-garhwal,I landed in Kotdwara along with a friend of mine from college to join our job back in 2009 at Kotdwara totally unaware. We founf this hotel just 50 steps from Garhwal Motor union Bus stand and immediately took accommodation there as it was quite cheap and very clean. The hotel staff are very helpful. They even looked after our luggage when we decided to check out and go look for company accommodation. All you can get in a Rs. 600 hotel room was available and more. Nice place!!,ambujnith,/Profile/ambujnith,"New Delhi, India",40
pauri-garhwal,"It is a budgeted hotel on Devi road but very nearby of Railway station and bus/taxi stand. Good ambiance, peaceful, double bed room sizes are enough large attached with a specious was room. Food from their kitchen is also good … Spending 500/- only for a day is quite cheap …",kingshuk2202roy,/Profile/kingshuk2202roy,Lucknow,30
pauri-garhwal,"Hotel Dev vani located on devi road in Kotdwar offes a decent accomodation.  As there are not much options, Dev vani is the only available option.  There are AC and non AC rooms. Do not expect luxury here,  the hotel is for breif halt before you move to the long journey through the deodar hills to pauri, lansdowne, tarkeshwar, neelkanth or yamkeshwar.  The hotel is also used for marriage ceremonies so at peak marriage seasons, availability may be an issue.  On the flip side, the toilet of some rooms stink due to limited ventilation although the exhaust fan is present.",Dudpuri,/Profile/Dudpuri,"Ahmedabad, India",30
pauri-garhwal,Hotel Dev Vani is the best budget hotel that one can get in Kotdwara. Rooms are neat & clean & room service is prompt. The manager is always ready to help with information. The hotel is mainly populated by business travelers or by travelers on transit. All the washrooms have geyser providing running hot & cold water for a relaxing shower. It is highly recommended for a short stay at Kotdwar.,andy_quality,/Profile/andy_quality,"Hyderabad, India",50
