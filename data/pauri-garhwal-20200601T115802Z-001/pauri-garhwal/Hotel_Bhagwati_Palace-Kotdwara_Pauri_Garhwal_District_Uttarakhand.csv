pauri-garhwal,"I booked the hotel through a travel portal and no room pics were given on it. The hotel is located hardly 50 m off the main sadar bazar market square. It does not have any restaurant attached but there are some in the market, but you cannot get room service. The rooms were clean and tidy but very very small with absolutely no moving space. We had lot of discomfort with opening our luggage. The bathroom was also small and did not have a shower.",Roamer077,/Profile/Roamer077,"Lucknow, India",30
