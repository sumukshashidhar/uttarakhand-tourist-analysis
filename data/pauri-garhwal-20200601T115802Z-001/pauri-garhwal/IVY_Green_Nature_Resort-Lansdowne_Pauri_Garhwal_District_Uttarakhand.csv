pauri-garhwal,"Nice property, rains played a spoiler. We had taken 6 rooms. Excellent rooms , very good service - they went out of the way to help us and delicious food - this was sumptuous, good variety and one of the best preparations..  Chanda Bisht and team are very good hosts.  But the property is not at all elderly and disabled friendly. While the manager tried to make stay comfortable but steps and slopes do not help. Also in a couple of rooms , there was leakage problem and hot water problem. That I think can be sorted if they check all rooms prior to guest check in. On the whole , would be a good stay for young people and couples - will give 4/5. If elderly and disabled are travelling, then avoid.",Akshat,/Profile/AJreviews10,,40

We visited Landsdowne to celebrate our anniversary and staying at this property made it worthwhile!  I will begin with room- We chose luxury room! It was so so spacious with an amazing forest view! Coming to food- We chose a meal plan with both brkfst and dinner! And it was again a very good decision, since with a kid it becomes very difficult to travel for dinner in hills! Food was just so amazing in taste! Mr. Manish Bohra hosted us throughout our stay! Fingerlicious dishes (Both veg and Non-veg) and butter tawa roti was a big hit! We felt as if we are eating home food!  Talking about other activities- What was not there! Ludo, housie, trampoline and sea saw",Kanika Gangwal,/Profile/Kanika1718,,50

pauri-garhwal,"Resort is made with passion and hence beautifully made.  The rooms are spacious and equipped with tea/coffee making facility (electric kettle). Rooms have individual heaters and water heater so you get 24X7 hot water. Washrooms are very specious and gives a modern look.  Parking is not near the reception, you need to trek 500-600 meters to reach there, but the resort provides e-rickshaw for the luggages. If someone is not willing to walk or can't walk they can sit in the e-rickshaw.  There is a place on the top from where you get to see the Himalaya covered with snow. There is a sitting arrangement as well, so if you want to spend some time alone this is the best place. The image I have attached is one of the views you get to see.

pauri-garhwal,"Ivy Green is about 5 km from Lansdowne on a separate road towards Tarkeshwar mahadev temple. Hence being within proximity to all the places in Lansdowne area.  Pros: 1. The highlight for me is their hill top point from where the view of distant Himalayas including tall peaks of Chaukhamba, Sumeru, Kedar and others could be seen on a clear sunny day. Even if the surroundings are hazy/cloudy, its still a good point to feel the sound of winds cutting through the pine trees in the vicinity. It  which could feel congested. 3.

pauri-garhwal,"Stayed in ivy green resort for two days on 22-24 Jun 19. Check in was smooth and heartwarming..all thanks to Chetan and his team. Spacious all amenity stay in luxury cottage. Extremely cooperative and polite staff. I saw them handling even the most complicated customers in a highly professional, calm and humble manner. Food was excellent. Neat and clean restaurant. I even found rates to be quite genuine considering the location.USP of this resort is it's location, kids enjoyed the most.. Points for improvement are.. 1.  More variety of cuisine can be incorporated in the menu.  2.  Hot water could not be provisioned even after complaint. Overall it was a highly rejuvenating and satisfying visit...

pauri-garhwal,So we booked ivy green resort from 19th to 22nd june. No doubt location is very good. But their service was very slow and rooms were not cleaned. We booked deluxe room for 2 nights and normal room for 1 night coz deluxe room was not available for 3 nights. They confirmed that last day they will shift us to normal room. But once we reach there they gave us normal room on the first day without any confirmation. When we asked them they said they will shift us next day to the deluxe room. Then next day in the morning when we asked them by what time they will shift us to the other room they said deluxe room is not available. We were like its completely waste of time. We spoke to the manager then they shifted us to deluxe room. If i talk about food it was the worst experience i ever,Neetu Antil,/Profile/Neetu_Antil,,10

Its a stretch of almost 150 min walk through the middle of very weird lane . Though they provide the rickshaw service but again its just one and we gave it to old people who were also waiting for them. They do not have any parking facility . People prefer to travel with drivers in the hilly region but they had no faclity for the drivers as well . I feel we got cheated in terms of money as well . We booked the second best room and yet it was quite bad . First we had to call room service to mop the floor. Dustbins were not clean .They had no subscribed channels for kids.

There is hardly any parking space for the vehicles and they have to parked on the roadside. The rooms were unkempt with plenty of broken fixtures, inadequate lighting, and just average room service.

We booked a luxury room which was the most expensive one however I felt that as per the money spent on the room the amenities and quality of the room was not that great. The room was not warm enough and the heater could not do enough heating either considering the cold night. Despite spending so much money in the off season and getting just a room which didnt even have breakfast included I personally felt in this price one can clearly get a five star resort room. Nevertheless, I want to highlight few points which were the plusses: # the place is surrounded by lush green trees and they have their own point from where you can see sunrise and snow clad mountains.
