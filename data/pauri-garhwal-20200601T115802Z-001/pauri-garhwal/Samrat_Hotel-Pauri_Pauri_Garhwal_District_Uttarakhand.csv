pauri-garhwal,A very decent resort. Very attractive location. Right on the bank of Alakanada river. Excellent view from almost all the rooms which are equipped with modern amenities. Sight seeings are arranged by the hotel staffs.  Service is very good. Quality food served. It is worth taking a halt here on one's way to Badrinath.,bijankolkata,/Profile/bijankolkata,Kolkata,40
