pauri-garhwal,A nice restaurant with excellent food preparation. It is recommended for travelers who wish to plan their meals midway. Nice scenic place alongside clean stream. Rooms also available. Car parking is  on the roadside and a nice blue bridge connects the resort. ,Vijay Singh,/Profile/vijaysR577TO,"Noida, India",40
pauri-garhwal,"Situated next to a stream, and we hired a tent for the night.The best part is getting up in the morning and cooling yourself in the running water of the stream. The tent is of a decent size, with attached toilet and a cooler. It is about 20-25 kilometres before Lansdowne though and at a significantly lower altitude, so it gets quite hot if you go in summer.",Souravwhotravelled,/Profile/Souravwhotravelled,"New Delhi, India",40
pauri-garhwal,"The tents are really good, worth staying into tents here. Comfortable bed, warn blankets. Personal washroom attached to tent as well. Veg items are good, i did not find non-veg that much good, as it was sort of okay. It has parking facility as well. This place if good for groups, i am not sure for couples as it is an isolated place.  3 kms above Dugadda village, and 23 Kms below Lansdowne. ",Karan W,/Profile/KaranW70,,40
pauri-garhwal,"This is not exactly in lansdowne and is a good 25odd km before it. We had a office team outing and this seemed a better place than the resorts nearby and it was a wise decision. The food, the rooms, and the overall expereince was top notch. The staff was also very polite. The best part is the stream flowing just in front of the resort. Great place for a weekend outing for Delhites.",Akshay Soni,/Profile/drakshay,"Pune, India",40

pauri-garhwal,"We stayed in the deluxe room - large!  Clean, homely, prompt, warm, super flexible; kitchen makes dishes as per your request (takes time though), and most of all, it is a unique property built inside the valley, with a stream running right past the rooms! The tents add to the feeling of adventure.  Do carry badminton rackets or even a light soccer size ball. Its very nice for that picnic like atmosphere.  But beware, its not Lansdowne. It is 45 minutes before it.  So no markets around, and also it is 2-3 degrees warmer than the very top of Lansdowne.  And yes - you ABSOLUTELY must have a car at your disposal, else forget this property.",VegetarianTourist,/Profile/VegetarianTourist,India,40
pauri-garhwal,"We stayed here in early June, primarily because kids wanted to enjoy slow flowing river. And since the adjacent SB Mount was sold out, we booked Spring Meedows. And this was not disappointing.   Location: Perfect for a river side place. Need to be avoided in rains as the river swells high. Though nothing else to do nearby. Lansdowne is good 1 hour from here.  Rooms: They have 3 categories of rooms -   Super Deluxe - 4 rooms which are inside a 2 storey building adjacent to reception cum restaurant area. The rooms didnt look inviting. It had only TV and bed. Though they said they would be adding fridge etc in the room in the future. Standard - These are 3 independent cottages and looks great from outside. They are at height and would offer direct view of river from glass windows.",Rajan_travel,/Profile/Rajan_travel,"New Delhi, India",40
