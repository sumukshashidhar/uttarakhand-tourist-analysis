pauri-garhwal,"We spent three nights here and enjoyed the location, close enough to Rishikesh and Haridwar to do things but able to escape and relax in nature. This is a basic hotel but a great deal for the price point. They provided us with different meals, gave good recommendations for day activities and prepared bonfires at night. Clean rooms and very attentive service.",zigeumac,/Profile/zigeumac,Chennai,50
