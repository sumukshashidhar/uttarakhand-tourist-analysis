pauri-garhwal,"Hills of Adventure was our most memorable stay during our one month in India. The hosts, Binny and Anks, went out of their way to make our visit very special. From the moment we arrived until saying goodbye we were treated like royality, or as Binny would say, ""You are God to us."" Their kindness, generosity and concern for our well-being was a constant.  When we mentioned that we missed having ice-cream Anks went to town in search for it, making it a complimentary surprise dessert. When we asked where the nearest ATM machine was, Anks drove us there. The list goes on. Nature's beauty surrounds this property and makes it a tranquil and relaxing place, but the hosts hospitality, warmth, friendliness and deep respect for others makes you feel like you're in paradise.
