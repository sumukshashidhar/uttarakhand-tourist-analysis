pauri-garhwal,"I had checked into the hotel at 8:30 pm and there is no other guest staying in hotel  They gave me room on 2nd floor I've requested him and tell him that I will pay extra for 1st floor room but he didn't responded. I was traveling with my mother, wife and 3mnths old baby.   It was a terrible experience that I will never forget  Rooms are dirty,staff is not well behaved,I have ordered tea and they served in dirty cups. Poor hygiene  No intercom in rooms, no toiletries available in the bathroom. Bed have poor cushions.  I was stuck in that hotel  Please don't visit that hotel with your family.",rajputpratap76,/Profile/rajputpratap76,"New Delhi, India",10
pauri-garhwal,"Hotel Location is awesome. Next to famous Sidhbali Temple and a lake. You will love the silence here, away from City. Hotel staff is also Good. I will definitely recommend this hotel to others. The price is also reasonable.",Rahul S Khatri,/Profile/rauliPauri,"Hyderabad, India",50
pauri-garhwal,"The property is situated away from the rush of centre, it very close to the Siddhaballi temple. The rooms are okay and don't have hot water arrangements, they will provide the bucket of hot water if required and only in the morning time. The breakfast is provided but not very options we have to confirm the breakfast availability earlier day to  be on safer side.",Ashay R,/Profile/ashayr2016,"Mumbai, India",30
