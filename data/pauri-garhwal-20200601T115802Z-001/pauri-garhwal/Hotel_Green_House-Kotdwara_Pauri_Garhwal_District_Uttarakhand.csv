pauri-garhwal,"While travelling to Lansdowne my family decided to stay in Kotdwar en route. The best perk is the parking facility and the location of the hotel away from the city crowd. It also has a huge garden attached to it and one can have a splendid view of the city from there. The hotel is quite reasonably priced, the staff is courteous and the rooms and washrooms are well-maintained.  Our stay was a very pleasant one. Definitely recommend this hotel, one of the best in Kotdwar.",theavidtraveler_007,/Profile/theavidtraveler_007,"New Delhi, India",40
