pauri-garhwal,"We were here to celebrate bachelors for one of our friends. Initially we had two twin sharing swiss tents and four tripe sharing swiss tents! However Ankit who is the owner was really helpful and upgraded our twin sharing tents to beautiful cottages for no extra charge! The view, the rooms, the blankets everything was really clean and the best part was that the staff was really helpful and very warm! Rafting was also included and awesome! The bonfire and barbecue too was nice! Food could have been better! Overall it is someplace I would love to go again and recommend others too!",Mansi V,/Profile/MansiV59,"Budapest, Hungary",40
