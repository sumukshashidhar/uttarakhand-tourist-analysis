Room are clean and good view. very peace area.

pauri-garhwal,Was not satisfied with the stay.. we stayed there for 3 nights from march 29th to march 31st... The rooms were not cleaned properly. The dustbins in the room were broken . The bathrooms were very ordinary and remained wet most of the time. they didnt provide towels too on daily basis. No soap or toilet tissues were available in the bathroom. The food they cooked was too oily and all the sabzi were of the same taste. No variation or differentiation.. roti was like papad .. Hardly we could eat anything. We didnt find any other alternative so had to stay there. I hope my review would help others not to choose this one and go for a much better resort in srinagar. No garden or play area actually it shouldnt be called as resort itself. According to me its a budget lodge for emergency,divya0903,/Profile/divya0903,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30

pauri-garhwal,I with two of my friends and our family were stayed in this property in our visit to Kashmir on 17/05/2015. The resort is very exotic place to stay. Every staff member was serving us as the resort is of his own. Very cooperative and courteous. The rooms are clean and specious.

pauri-garhwal,We stayed in this so called resort for 2 nights and finally moved to dal gate area. staff is not at all friendly and once after dusk you cant move out of the hotel. one of our known doctor booked this resort for us but we disliked completely and the charges are very high. it seems that you are staying in a jungle and you are made to stay here as a punishment. no wifi and complete hotel was vacant when we checked in. not at all recommended.,Saahir20,/Profile/Saahir20,"Mumbai, India",10
pauri-garhwal,Location is poor as finding it without local help is difficult.Food is average.Restaurant is outside the main building.No room service.Reception area disturbs ground floor occupants as wifi comes only there so all youngsters crowd around and phone keeps on ringing through the night.,Sudipto710,/Profile/Sudipto710,"Jabalpur, India",20
pauri-garhwal,"My tour operator booked this property for me in Srinagar & I have given him same feedback as I am writing here. This is one of the worst property in Srinagar. 1). First, it's deep inside somewhere in old city. You won't be able to find it without local help. Even it won't show on Google maps easily. 2). Service is pathetic. They don't even provide room service. You will have to go their restaurant which is outside the main hall. 3). Food is really bad. On top of it, they have a fixed menu for dinner and breakfast for which they charge you hefty amount for awful stuff. So, please avoid this hotel. 4). Hotel lobby area is untidy as the customer eats in restaurant and then comes all the way down to hotel lobby to wash hands as in restaurant there is only place where one can drink.
