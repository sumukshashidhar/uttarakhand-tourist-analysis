pauri-garhwal,"The camp is sheer excellence, food was extremely good (we didnt expect it as the prices were so low). Local kayaking spot at the back, great view, nice and cozy tents and the staff was super cool. We went slightly earlier than the start of the season so on our first day (Friday) it was totally empty, 4 of us friends literally had a riverside bronfire dinner all for us. On the second day however there was quite some crowd, and with the prices so low, it was bound to be some dissatisfying crowd, The people created some scene but anyways the staff handled it well. The rafting experience was great and specially our guide. But beware, the video recording that was done, didnt had any audio. We were shouting and cheering all along the raft to later find out all the videos had audio",Aman S,/Profile/amans404,delhi,50

pauri-garhwal,"Location, location, location... this camp wins all points on location itself. Hills on all sides with a rivulet encircling it, camp hideaway is by far the quietest and most secluded camps you will find among the myriad camps on the ganges around Rishikesh. There is no camp for kilometers near it and there are no villages around either. It's one beutiful sweet little spot. It is also easy on the pocket. We went there to celebrate the second birthday of my daughter, 15 of us on December 23, 2016. They charged us 1,200 per person with food included.  There was bonfire in the evening by the river and the manager also arranged for good music for everyone to enjoy. We set up our own barbecue and made kababs under a sky full of stars.

After researching about several camps, I finally settled down for this one. We were going from Delhi and it took us 7/8 hours to reach the camp. I was worried that after such a  long journey my guest should not be disappointed in the location or the feel of the place. But to my relief the moment we reached there, people were so happy with location. Everyone said that it is an excellent place at such a beautiful location.

The trekking to a village and an opportunity to mingle with children, then serving in the Langgar made a meaningful trip. Rock climbing, rappelling, slithering, cliff jumping and rafting added a lifetime experience.

pauri-garhwal,First of all the sign boards on road are totally wrong it shows Camp Hideaway is 9 Km but actually its 16KMs may be the reason when I met with Owner he told me that they have shifted their property last month only well taken that can be over ruled the owner Mr.Deepak came and met us personally and assured couple of things which their employees don't give a dam the property is handled by young local boys no manger or any responsible person to whom you can report or ask any thing.Food Cold worst break fast you ask me anything which is fine i will never ever visit or recommend to any one.
