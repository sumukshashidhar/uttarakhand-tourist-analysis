pauri-garhwal,"We booked  our room with them but the management is very very poor they even don't know what is the value of the customer they need only money, No doubts room is good but the staff (Hotel Manager) Mr Gairola so clever while booking they are very humble and when we paid money to them they are showing their colours,  they spoil our whole i will not recommenced this property for future",Deepak,/Profile/Memorableindia2015,"New Delhi, India",10
pauri-garhwal,"The Hotel is bang on on the Badrinath Highway in Srinagar-UK, the hotel was on 2nd floor with a rickety lift but it was neat and clean. The accommodation was in the budget range with cozy bed and clean toilets, stayed there with my family. Though the hotel doesn't have its own kitchen but its being rented out to a third party, and the food served was light and good for our stomach, hence it was an overall a good stay. Would rate the hotel 3/5, as the tea coffee maker was missing from the room which would have being an added advantage for a family stay. ",Vikymania,/Profile/Vikymania,"Sahibabad, India",40
pauri-garhwal,"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights and had good stay. The service and food were good. Rooms are also comfortable considering other options near by. I always stay in this hotel whenever I visit Srinagar. One more good thing was that by mistake I paid extra amount during checkout to Hotel (paid online to book the hotel) which I got to know 3-4 days after checkout. I wrote the mail to owner and I immediately received the response with confirmation and the amount was refunded the same day in my account.  Thanks to the owner.  Recommend this hotel considering service, food and cleaniness.",sunnybhatt,/Profile/sunnybhatt,"New Delhi, India",40
pauri-garhwal,"We (family of 3) stayed here for an overnight stay in October 2017 and found rooms neatly built with clean washrooms, comfortable bed, nice AC and quite spacious. Only thing this hotel lacks is a view from room otherwise a good hotel to stay. Staff was helpful as well. They have basement parking too.",MohitSinghal,/Profile/MohitSinghal,"Noida, India",40
pauri-garhwal,"Best hotel in srinagar for the purpose of stay. Clean and economical, with almost all modern amenities and friendly staff. Central air conditional works like a charm. Had a wonderful and comfortable stay.",kritarth u,/Profile/kritarthu,,50
pauri-garhwal,"Situated at the main highway with safe parking facility this is the main benefit of this hotel.  Cleanliness is very good, only veg food is the option with less option.  Room service is not up-to mark. No wifi, but best place to stay enroute to badrinath/kedarnath",Indian Travel Hobo,/Profile/indianhobo,"Chennai, India",30
