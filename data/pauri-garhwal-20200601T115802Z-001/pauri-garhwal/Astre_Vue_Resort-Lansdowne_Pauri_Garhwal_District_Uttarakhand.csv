I booked the highest category rooms and luxury tents but to my surprise I came to know at the end that I was given a lower category room (Room No. 218). I inquired with the property manager Gurpreet while checking out to which he responded unprofessionally saying that the smaller shabby room which i got also belonged to premium category.

pauri-garhwal,This is a beautiful property. The staff and owners (Rawats) are very warm. Spent a wonderful time. I would highly recommend this property the only shortcoming was that service is a bit slow. I guess that's also because of the fact that they are new. But the warmth the staff and owner extend Its overall a good experience. The rooms offers great views and kids would just love to be in Glasshouse. A must experience when one visits Landsdowne,bhavnaspall,/Profile/bhavnaspall,"New Delhi, India",50

pauri-garhwal,"Astre Vue resort is a place truly doing justice to its name. It gives an enormous view to the  jewels of the sky. One can wake up to a clear view of sunrise; sit and relax to the view of Himalayan ranges in the noon, romance the dimming setting sun in the evening and be left mesmerised by the stars and moon so close to you in the night. The resort offers beautiful, clean rooms and homely food in the lap of nature . The owner of the Resort- Mr. Yash is a warm, friendly man and so accomodative to your needs. He makes sure that the visitors get an amazing experience and leave the place with loads of memories. He was kind enought to arrange for a guitarist for making my birthday evening a special one ...the bonfire was a cherry on the cake.

pauri-garhwal,We decided to make our less than ordinary as we left the smog filled Delhi for a weekend at lansdowne. We reached late night at the resort but the owner was there to give us a warm welcome. The view from this place is fantastic and November was a great time to visit weather wise. The owner lives in the property with his parents and they are all super friendly and warm. We had a great time at this resort. Rooms are basic but have all the facilities and these huge windows from where we could see the sunrise as we woke up. Staff is friendly too. Go here with a book as they have a lovely glass house where you can sit and read in scenic surroundings!,Nishtha B,/Profile/NishthaB12,,50

pauri-garhwal,"If you are looking for peace and tranquility in the lap of mother nature this is it. Located on top of the mountain peak surrounded by lush greenery and valleys on both sides, Astrevue not only gives u a chance to witness snow peaks but also offers majestic views of sunrise and sunsets.   Location is excellent. There is nothing that disturbs you here. All you can hear are the ambient sounds of the wild. There is hardly any habitation nearby and the nights and the morning views are just pure and unadulterated.  Food is gastronomic. You may choose the items from the menu or just ask the Chef to prepare what he likes and I assure, you won't regret. All the pounds you add can be of loaded though if you choose to go for a trek to the neighboring peaks or Bhairo Mandir which is a 45",Navin Saini,/Profile/NavinS_13,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
