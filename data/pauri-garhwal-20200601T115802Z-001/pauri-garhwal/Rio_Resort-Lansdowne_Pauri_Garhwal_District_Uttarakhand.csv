pauri-garhwal,"Nice property, good food and courteous staff. All that we needed to be away from daily madness and the hospitality we experienced was worth a compliment. I referred to feedback in tripadvisor and found it to be true 5 star experience.",Traveler_79,/Profile/79jasleenk,"Bhimtal, India",50
pauri-garhwal,"Planned and booked this resort on someone's recommendation. Once you are used to staying at big Brands only, any new name only invites apprehension. However, right from the very first interaction with Nishi, everything changed. She explained the packages and personally assured of great service. I must say that its one of the best resort in a hill station that I've ever stayed at. Please Opt for cottage, if you are planning a stay at this resort.

pauri-garhwal,"We stayed as couple, spent 2 lovely days in this property.  Had a great river side candlelight dinner. They arranged for every thing. Staff helped us by providing a cellphone as there were no signals in our cell phones. Location is around 15km before Lansdowne cantt.   Pros: 1. Helpful and Friendly staff & manager 2. Riveside is great. It's safe and you can enjoy.  3. Cottages are great.  4. Tasty food. 5. They organize small events for you if you request them before. Had a great evening & candle light dinner.   Cons: 1. Cellphone signals are difficult to get. No network for jio. You will get one bar for airtel.",Abhishek R,/Profile/AbhishekR1028,,50
pauri-garhwal,Beautiful property with clean and spacious rooms.food was average but service was quick and staff was polite as well.will definitely recommend to travellers. Only dissapointment was interconnected rooms which kind of disturbed as you could hear everything happening in the other room.,Aditya Prakash,/Profile/prakashaditya208,"New Delhi, India",50
pauri-garhwal,Went there for a weekend in October... we stayed at the cottage by the river side... cottages are adequately equipped and was clean when we checked in... Food was above average and pocket friendly.. Room service was  prompt and quick even on a busy weekend.. The best part was the river.. you can sit in your cottage's balcony or even step down in the river itself to enjoy.. The resort is around 20kms before lansdowne but you can always take a day's taxi to lansdowne and come back.. Overall must visit resort,RahulMPT,/Profile/RahulMPT,"Faridabad, India",50

pauri-garhwal,"Stay at Rio was wonderful. We (3 adults) booked premium room (without balcony) in the multi-level building. We were amazed to see the cottages built so beautifully that wanted to upgrade but those were already booked.  We thought our room wouldn't be that great compared to the cottages. But to my surprise even those rooms were impressively well designed. They have indoor and outdoor games as well. As it is on the highway itself, local buses and taxis are easily available. Approx 20 kms from the main town, Lansdowne. The staff is commendable. They are very spontaneous and very helpful.  The breakfast was sumptuous and tasty. No complaints with food quality or quantity.  The buffet was also great with variety of spread each day. The owner also met the guests and personally took",Anjali B,/Profile/AnjaliB228,,40
pauri-garhwal,"This was the WORST experience my family and I have ever had, and it's a continuing nightmare. The owner Nishi Aggarwal is a cheat and cons people into staying at the resort under false claims. We were looking forward to a trip with our dog, and booked online through Make My Trip (ontripadvisor), where it said the hotel was pet-friendly. We paid the whole accommodation fee in advance, just under INR 50,000. When I called to check if one of the rooms was big enough for two adults and a dog, the owner became immediately defensive, and started yelling at me, saying the hotel was NOT pet-friendly. IT GETS BETTER! She said our booking was cancelled, that 'we would not be allowed on her property' and to avoid paying me a refund, checked me into the hotel and checked me out two days",Belagola,/Profile/belagola,,10
pauri-garhwal,The place is deplorable. Dont go by the pics. Its all trick photography. You never find water in the stream. Though the roms are descent but the food is below standard. By 8 pm they wil stop serving you snacks and will tell you to order main course. They will ensure your evenings are spoiled. They are always short on food supplies and try to sell only what they have in stock.   While settling of the final billing we found other rooms order included in our billing.... thank God we checked and cought them. They try to give you discounts to cover their shortcomings. The staff is inexperienced and rude.  The rating given are all fake given by their own people. Never go for this place in your life.,AnshulK02,/Profile/AnshulK02,"New Delhi, India",10

pauri-garhwal,"This resort is just 230 kms away from Delhi. Its a very relaxing place for a weekend getaway. For adventure lovers and bird watchers, its a paradise! There are so many species of birds which one can see right from their balcony in the morning. And, if you're lucky, an occasional visit from a spotted deer might grace your stay.

pauri-garhwal,"Positives 1. Excellent cottages 2. Excellent staff and their hospitality 3. Excellent comfort  Make sure before you book 1. This place is at a 1.5 hrs distance from Lansdowne and hence slightly hotter 2. Considering distance you will have to travel to and fro Lansdowne to cover the tourist spots 3. This place has no / minimal internet connectivity, which could be good and troublesome as well. Carry enough cash. 4. Food is average. I had expected a  great hill station kindaa food..of u know what I mean  Most important Please make sure to do all your bookings related interactions over email. I can't make this in bold and underline format but this was the only point which kind of left a bad mark on our experience.

They are expanding and near future this should be one of the best property in Lansdowne.  There in house cook is nice and is able to justify your taste buds at reasonable prices.
