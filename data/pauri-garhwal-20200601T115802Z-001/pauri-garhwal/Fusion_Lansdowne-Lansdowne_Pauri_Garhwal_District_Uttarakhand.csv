pauri-garhwal,"It was a small outing for about eight families of my office staff. Lansdowne being a clean and unexplored place we chose this. Challenge was to find a nice place to suit our needs. This hotel made it perfect.  Nice food, comfortable stay, dance, music, games, bone fire and sight seeing, they arranged it all. We regret having stayed for three days only or we could have visited jim Corbett range in vicinity and some other tourist spots as well. Felt like coming here again in summers. ThankYou Mr Anurag Goel for arranging everything at such a short notice.",Adventurer585310,/Profile/Adventurer585310,,50
