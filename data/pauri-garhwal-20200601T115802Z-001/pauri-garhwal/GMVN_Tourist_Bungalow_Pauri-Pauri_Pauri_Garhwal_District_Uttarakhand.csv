pauri-garhwal,"We stayed here while returning from Auli. It's at the end corner of Pauri, a small vibrant town in Garhwal. Knowing huge traffic on the main NH highway, consciously took alternate route of meerut-bijnor-kotdwar-pauri-srinagar onwards and retunr from Mana/ Auli. It really saved time and mental peace, though the route is little longer.   At this place, GMVN can be considered a good option, slightly better than average. Good polite staff to help you as they can, OK homely food, big rooms at very competitive fair, good mountain view from the property, nice weather- one may consider this as a night pitstop while on this route.",kcpdelhi,/Profile/kcpdelhi,"New Delhi, India",40
pauri-garhwal,"The location is good, but the property being very old, is dated. Though, it has been repaired and condition better than our last visit in 2000. But service is lackadaisical, casual. Water shortage is there, no generator back up for power cuts. ",Nilanjana Ray,/Profile/NilanjanaR18,,30
pauri-garhwal,"This property is on height from where you can see almost half of Pauri City, Rooms are big, well maintained, Room Service available, has Restaurant, ample parking, approx half k.m. from bus stand. Best option to live in Pauri, if u are here to enjoy natural ambience.",NISHANKSAROHI,/Profile/NISHANKSAROHI,"Uttarkashi, India",30
pauri-garhwal,Avoid the place. It's a case study on how not to do and discourage tourism in one the most potential locations. It appeared that the staff hates the arrival of guests. Looked like zombies. Spent a night somehow. Yuk !,@Masat_Malang101,/Profile/Mast_Malang101,,10
pauri-garhwal,It used to be a professionally run facility once upon a time. I stayed here for the first time in the year 1999 and again in May 2018. Earlier it was a nice facility with average service but now the TRH is in really bad shape and run by a totally demoralized staff. GMVN can make more money by demolishing it and turning it into a paid parking. The location is really nice though !,Mountain_Shepherds,/Profile/Mountain_Shepherds,"Auli, India",10
pauri-garhwal,"It was worst experience, staff of TRH was not in no mood to run this, because of lack of maintenance my car was badly hit ramp of Hotel, dining room was unhygienic. There was no exhaust fan in toilet. Location is good by Hotel is bad.",Atul G,/Profile/AtulG384,,10
pauri-garhwal,"The service is good, and food served was also Good. The view of Himalayas from the Rest House is awesome. One can see panoramic views of Nilkantha, Bandar Poonch, Swargarohini, Kedarnath, Kharcha Kund, Satopanth, Chaukhamba, Ghoriparvat, Haathi Parvat, Sumeru and many more.",Rahul S Khatri,/Profile/rauliPauri,"Hyderabad, India",40
pauri-garhwal,"GMVN Tourist Bungalow Pauri - is an excellent place to stay for its Excellent location, the huge area and the breathtaking view from the bead room. However, it require some renovation, and the rooms are old and the bathrooms are not maintained properly. It has ample parking space for cars and good place to stay in a group of families and friends. Over all it was a good experience.",BratinGhosh,/Profile/BratinGhosh,"Kolkata, India",50
pauri-garhwal,"We booked the place, believing that it belongs to GMVN. It's location and view was ok but the maintenance and living conditions were totally unbearable. The staff and food was good. Nobody would ever like to stay in such property. There were pigs roaming around. Two of them died and nobody clear the body for two days. Pathetic.....",Manish A,/Profile/manisha414,,10
pauri-garhwal,"First the positives - You can have a fantastic view - right from your room - of the mountain range IF there are no clouds.  Now the negatives -Apart from the view, and you get it only if you are very very very lucky, there is absolutely nothing else to do here. Thought this is a district headquarter, the market area is quite small and excessively dirty. In fact, I have no hesitation in saying that this might be one of the dirtiest towns in India.   The GMVN Tourist Bungalow fits snugly with this overall dirtiness. The courtyard is shared by the Bungalow, an Adventure Outfit's office, 5 dogs and 4 cows. Result - piles of dung everywhere.   The deluxe rooms are good and generally clean. They are habitable for a day or so without any problem.  The ordinary rooms are dirty and",bishwaksen,/Profile/bishwaksen,"Kolkata, India",30
pauri-garhwal,"Stayed here for a night while returning from Badrinath. I had the super deluxe room which has a common front open area. Views from this open area are very good. Food is sort of good but very limited dishes are on offer. Service is good, place your order 45 minutes before hand as they generally tend to cook on order (fresh food).",borntotravel123,/Profile/borntotravel123,"Noida, India",40
pauri-garhwal,"We were looking for a place to stay in Pauri as we had reached late at night. As we reached GMVN, we saw that some kind of function had just finished in the main parking area of the lodge. As we somehow found a place to park the car, I asked somebody to tell me where the lobby was. I couldn't help but get freaked out when he pointed to a dark door beyond which there were no lights. I started my car and got out of there as soon as I could.",RandomTravalOr,/Profile/RandomTravalOr,"New Delhi, India",10
pauri-garhwal,"We stayed overnight at the GMVN Srinagar (Pauri Garhwal) property while going to Badrinath.  This is a nice property offering spacious rooms, driver accommodation, vehicle parking and homely food in its restaurant.   Location: Located right in the middle of the town. So there is plenty of hustle bustle. Mountains can be viewed from rooms but Alaknanda River is not visible from this property.  Staff & Service: The staff is courteous and cooperative and service is quite good.   Rooms: We stayed in Super Deluxe Room. This had an AC in working condition. Srinagar gets hot and humid - so its a nice thing to have. The room was on the 1st Floor.Room is big and spacious, so is bathroom and dressing area. We got an extra mattress and 3 persons easily and comfortably slept in the room.",Yogesh,/Profile/Japakusum,"Maheshwar, India",40
pauri-garhwal,"It is located right on the main Badrinath road in Srinagar(Pauri Garhwal). Srinagar is the largest district of Garhwal with good market which was quite crowded. Booked the hotel room in quite advance and at the time of my visit it was quite empty, rooms are of average size and basic with small attached balcony, tv, cooler, charging point, electric back up, carpet and heater facility (for which you have to pay separately at each GMVN), don't expect any luxury being run and owned by government rooms rates are nominal. No intercom facility was available so have to make numerous visits to restaurant at ground floor to make any order though food was good and priced at reasonable rates only vegetarian food were serve at GMVN hotels, car parking facility is available have to park in",Anish01,/Profile/Anish01,"New Delhi, India",40
pauri-garhwal,"As with most 'official' (read government) properties, this hotel offers the best views in the lovely town of Pauri. It helped that the rooms were freshly painted, giving a 'new' look to the property. Rooms are decent, & have huge windows offering himalyan views on clear days. Pauri itself is a crowded little town; this place is in the centre yet just the perfect distance away from the noise. Food needs to be ordered in advance, & is totally fine if you dont expect anything fancy. A nice base for numerous walks along the ridge & a couple of temples at the top. Peaceful stay guaranteed :)",nrupal,/Profile/nrupal,Mumbai,40
pauri-garhwal,Had a nice stay here. Its cheap and value for money. Rooms are big and clean. Had to compromise with the room service. Not many options available for food here. You have to go outside for food. According to the charges it is good. There is a parking area too for your vehicle.,rachit m,/Profile/racs31,"New Delhi, India",30
