pauri-garhwal,"I booked this hotel for my parents in Dec 2015. It was very near from railway station and the Siddhbali temple(which is main attraction of this place). It is just a small hotel with neat, clean rooms, well maintained, with very good and courteous service, helpful and very cooperative staff. They have good food. Breakfast and dinner was included. They are quite flexible with the meal timings and menu. To summarize, great value for money and amazing hospitality. Rooms are on 2nd floor and no elevator.",DrNikhil143,/Profile/DrNikhil143,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50

pauri-garhwal,"I made a walk-in reservation here late afternoon for a 5-hour layover between Lansdowne and Delhi.  Room: spotlessly clean, great fluffy pillows & soft quilt. A bit small, but I am assuming that is because I bargained the tariff and stressed that I wasn't looking for luxury. I was still able to walk around the room comfortably.  Bathroom: reasonably clean, independent water heater.  Location: An easy 5-minute walk from the railway station. If you have luggage, an auto rickshaw will take you there for 15-20 rupees. The view from my room on the 3rd floor was also pleasant. (Note: they do not have balconies within the rooms, but a common corridor with the rooms all on one side)  Food: The food was very good, although how I came to taste it is a story in itself.  Service: 5 stars. ",or0chiYagami,/Profile/or0chiYagami,"Ahmedabad District, India",40
