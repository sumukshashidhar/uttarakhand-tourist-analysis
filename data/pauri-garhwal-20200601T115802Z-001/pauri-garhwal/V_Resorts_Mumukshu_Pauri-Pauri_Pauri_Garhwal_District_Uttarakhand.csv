pauri-garhwal,"I came here accidentally and must say that this is the most beautiful accident of my travel life! ðŸ˜›  The resort is big and at a beautiful location overlooking the valley. Perfect for a solo or family holiday.   I would put this at a ""3 star plus"" category because its very clean and spacious.  The staff is warm. Service is good if you are not in hurry.   Do meet Ramsingh,the cook. He is like the ""mom in the kitchen"", cooks absolutely delicious Indian food and puts his heart in it!   I came here to write so was looking for a quiet place. Unfortunately, I didn't take note of now being the  ""tourist season"". In the daytime when the tourists are out, its a bliss.  They have two categories of rooms- deluxe and cottage.

pauri-garhwal,"The resort is quaint, in a laid back, old world way. The staff are simple and happy, not just dutifully polite. The rooms we booked are named cottages; they are snug, even smallish, and the comforts and amenities are basic, but clean and comfortable. But each cottage looks out at a wide panorama of hills, which transform into a hemisphere of snowpeaks every early morning. This is a true highlight. Having spent a fortnight on the trot all over Garhwal hills in a number of hotels, I can say with authority that this view here is one of a kind.

Here's the breakdown :  Pros: * The rooms are spacious enough for medium amount of luggage.  * There are blowers (heater) in the room, so we were very comfortable during the stay.  * The staff (Sanjay and others) were quite helpful and made the stay comfortable.  * Food is fine and fresh. We usually ate in the room.  * Bathrooms are clean and spacious with geyser.

pauri-garhwal,"So, I planned to move out from Delhi for the new year and celebrate my new year in peace.  Thatâ€™s when I reached pauri, Vresorts Mumukshu. One of the most beautiful place surrounded by beautiful view of Himalayas. My favourite place of the whole resort is the outdoor lawn area, where I celebrated my new year with a born fire and old rum.  Now letâ€™s talk about the hospitality. Very very friendly house keeping staff and an amazing sheff. They have a common room, where you can catch up with all the news and tv shows, but trust me you wonâ€™t find a need once you see the surroundings.

A two-day visit was enough to convince me to trade skyscrapers and traffic for a few days in the lap of luxury amid the hills and lakes that typify Pauri.  Boarding Dehradoon Shatabdi in Delhi, I observed that though most people were heading to Dehradun there were a few who alighting at Haridwar, like me. Nameless faces passed by with their faces registering emotion; hope, grief, desire for redemption, longing for enlightenment, fervent prayers. There were others heading to Rishikesh judging by the travel gear. Not me.
