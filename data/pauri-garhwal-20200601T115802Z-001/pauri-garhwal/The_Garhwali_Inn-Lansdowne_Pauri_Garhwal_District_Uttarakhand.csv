pauri-garhwal,The perfect hotel for friends and family.  Clean rooms with superb view . I would recommend go for terrace room for best experience.  Amazing food  Very friendly staff  Location is very good. All sightseeing are nearby.,Yash,/Profile/Yash151193,,50
pauri-garhwal,"The good: -Location of the property is good, view of the corbett side of the valley right from the room balcony itself.  -Food was excellent.  -Dining hall overlooks the valley.  -The terrace offers a much panoramic view of the valley and slight view of the inner himalayan peaks. Mt. Chaukhamba and adjacent peaks were seen from terrace itself.  I booked a super deluxe room but it was average in amenities. Some fellow travellers reported unclean rooms.  But few downsides that we encountered were: -no coffee making kit in the rooms (its a small thing but makes a difference when you want to enjoy the valley view with hot sip of a coffee/tea) ,  -cable tv not working on first day,  -cushions not clean, -room dustbin not cleared on second day, -no dustbin in the bathroom to throw",Harshit Srivastava,/Profile/harshitsrvstv,"Noida, India",30

I had a room on the 1st floor but degraded to underground rooms with a smaller balcony. The rooms are really dirty , not cleaned well, poor furniture, really poor toilet.

pauri-garhwal,I was not expecting much on a two day break from Delhi and chose Garhwali Inn based on reviews and the fact that it allows pets. The pleasant experience started the moment I made the call. (advice -- dont book through websites - go directly to www.thegarhwaliinn.com  you will get a better deal) The manager Mr CM Dhulia had positive vibes the moment  I spoke to him and he kept track of us till we reached. The rooms were excellent clean and value for money the views are breathtaking.The staff looked after us like family and the food was excellent. It came as no surprise that the manager was retd from the Army - it was evident from the quiet efficiency of the place. They even managed to provide help for my trekking requirements.

The view from the terrace and dining room of the hotel is breathtaking. The staff is very polite, professional and helpful but the person who makes all the difference to the hotel is the Manager, CM Dhuliya who is a very enterprising person and  who made a personal effort to help us and also entertain us. The hotel has beautiful paintings and lanterns. We also enjoyed the food quite a lot as it has traditional garhwali flavors. Hope to visit this place once again to enjoy a wonderful stay in the lap of nature.

So we had to go another 4 km out of town. So the first night we just took the first hotel we could see but the next day we started looking for the best hotel we could find. So we came to “The Garhwali Inn”. We could choose the room we liked the most – and had the best view ever in an amazing surrounding. We could see the mountains from our hotel room and from our terrace right in front of the room. And the best thing: We could watch the sunrise from our beds!!

Only two chairs were given which was inadequate. No hanger system was there and the clothes had to be kept in the bed which provided a huge impediment. Further, the food was not as per the menu.

pauri-garhwal,We went to Lansdowne to celebrate New Year with my 2 other friends. We were 3 couple and 4 kids in a group.  We stayed there for 3 night 4 days and it was a memorable trip. Every one from our group enjoyed a lot. We took valley view rooms with balcony attached. The valley view from balcony was mesmerizing; especially morning when sun’s rays enter your bedroom room becomes more vibrant. Rooms are spacious and there is no need for extra bedding as sofa-cum-bed is already there in every room. The only thing we missed is cupboard otherwise it is a value for money hotel.

In very few words, I and my family felt this is a nice place with properly clean and fine ambiance rooms with very courteous and nice staff. We payed a price of Rs. 1500 for one room including breakfast. The price may vary depending on peak and lean time in Lansdowne.   In case you don't like or find anything in the room eg- bedsheets, mosquito repellent, etc, you may tell the hotel manager (Mr. Rawat) and he get the things done quickly.   Coming to food, the taste was perfectly fine, though we only did breakfast but the price of the food items in menu card is reasonable.
