pauri-garhwal,"Beautiful place to stay with great views over Dal Lake. Amenities- everything taken care of no problem, free of charge or at local prices.   Shamus and Javeed are both decent people who will make every effort to help you enjoy your time here, including arranging tours if you like, collecting little things for you from shops free of charge (stuff like shampoo, tape, cigarettes etc.)  Food is free, and delicious. Rooms are great- full of intricate carvings and tapestries. Very peaceful atmosphere,you can sit out front and watch the world go by.  There isn't actually WiFi here, but with an Indian SIM you won't need it.   Easy to get to (go to the end of new khonakan road and ask for a shikara boat to Shamus Maqbool- when I was here they were free of charge).  All in all a great",Jake,/Profile/ddvdnciballshdhdvdbj,,50
