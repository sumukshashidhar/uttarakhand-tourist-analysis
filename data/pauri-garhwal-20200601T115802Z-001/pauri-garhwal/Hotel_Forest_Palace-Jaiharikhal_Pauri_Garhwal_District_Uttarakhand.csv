pauri-garhwal,"Went with my family for a weekend getaway to this beautiful quaint hill station. By the time we planned of going almost all properties were sold out. Then a family friend told us about this Hotel wherein we got the booking. Situated some 5-6kms from the main Lansdowne, the hotel is situated in Jaiharikhal. The view from our room was stupendous! Good view of the snow capped peaks was so surreal.The day we reached, it was almost 7 in the evening and made no sense to move out after the tiring drive. We ordered food from their restaurant, amazingly tasty food they served. They have the provision of bonfire as well in the biting cold.  The next morning was sunny so we sun basked in the lawns enjoying the view again. All in all: Neat and clean rooms.

They even allowed us to go to their terrace and it was fun sitting & viewing the place. Mr. Ajay was very helfpul & helped us with all our requirements.

An early morning walk is must.  You will surely be touched by the location and the property.   One key thing: People not having personal transport should book taxi from Lansdowne to Jaiharikhal(Doesn't cost much), do not opt for sharing transport as they drop you far from hotel and you end up walking through.

The place is quite silent.You will have to park your vehicle on the roadside corner as there is no dedicated parking space. One thing i would like to highlight is the quality of service. Its not good and people with high expectations may not like it. I usually don't mind that much but due to lack of understanding from their side , I felt bad.

Choice is yours train or Bus, both option will take you to Kotdwar (Nearest railway station or Bus station to reach Lansdowne).  You can opt Cab or Bus to reach Lansdowne from  kotdwar, which runs very frequently between two locations.  How about the stay? In lansdowne you wont get the ample options to stay, but the place i stayed (Hotel Hill Top Forest palace) was really very good and felt like ""i was at home"".
