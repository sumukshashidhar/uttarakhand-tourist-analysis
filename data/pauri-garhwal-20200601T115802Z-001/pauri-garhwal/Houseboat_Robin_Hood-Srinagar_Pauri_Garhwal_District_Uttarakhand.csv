pauri-garhwal,When you talk about Kashmir this is the place I can always think of. A place to connect where you get right information and guidance. A place where you see what Kashmiriyat (hospitality) means. I will visit them again whenever I go to Kashmir again.,SalwatHamrah,/Profile/SalwatHamrah,Bangalore,50
pauri-garhwal,I have never seen such a hospitality anywhere else. The staff is even ready to give their personal time for your service. Awesome Experience and above all great value for money. I recommend House Boat Robinhood for all the visitors especially who will be visiting valley for the first time.,Anubhav,/Profile/anubhav72,"New Delhi, India",50
pauri-garhwal,Srinagar is a Place Worth seeing for. If someone wishes to stay here the best place would be Robin Houseboat. The service offered by the owner Mr.Amin is beyond words.

pauri-garhwal,This is n aew houseboat. Built not more than 10 to 15 years ago. Food was very good both veg and non-veg. In the evening weather was pleasant.  Hospitality was simply superb. Beautiful houseboat at Dal lake tucked away in a quiet corner..... Enjoyed the beauty of the mountains and Dal Lake sitting in the balcony of the houseboat. Amin bhai (owner of the houseboat) arranged a trip to Dal lake by shikara.....Recommend everyone to stay at Dal lake....He can arrange all your needs.....Overwhelmed with his hospitality....He will make you feel home away from your home.,stephaniebgiffard,/Profile/stephaniebgiffard,"Ile-de-France, France",50
