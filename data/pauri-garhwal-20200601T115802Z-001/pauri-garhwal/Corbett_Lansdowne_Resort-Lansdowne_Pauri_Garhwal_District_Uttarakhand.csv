pauri-garhwal,I stayed at this resort in last weekend of june 2016. I book it through its Delhi office. The way to reach the hotel is so risky and hotel is full of flies and very unclean rooms. Food quality is also very poor and Hotel staff is so rude. i will not suggest it to anyone even if you get it free,CA Deepak A,/Profile/CADeepakA3,,10

pauri-garhwal," After reading so many adverse comments, everybody in the family was reluctant to go n stay in this hotel. But as we didn't have many options we decided to go there.   Hotel does have few problems like the steep rough decline to reach the hotel. The road is kaccha and dusty and it need guts to drive down specially if it rains.  There's no telephone network except BSNL, They do provide you free Wi-Fi but it's not much of help as it doesn't work all the time.  One of the rooms was leaking but when complained we were shifted to another room. Every room has a tea/coffee maker but they don't provide you tea/coffee or milk that you need to go and buy from the market.   Breakfast buffet was average but food is good. They have a good kitchen in the basement and Chef Joshi was able to",RSahni57,/Profile/RSahni57,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
pauri-garhwal,"They don't have a proper kitchen, food comes from jungle resort, so you have to order them at least an hour before. Neither is there any extension service to reception or kitchen, so if you want anything, you have to go ask them yourself. service staff dont come to provide water also if you dont call them. And owner is arrogant but staff is polite.",Shailenderchoudhary,/Profile/Shailenderchoudhary,"New Delhi, India",20
pauri-garhwal,"Dear readers ,please say a big no to this property .It's a worst property to stay in . Rooms not clean ,leakage in washrooms , food not good .It was under construction , seems like the owner wants to finish construction in hurry so there is no one to look after the maintenance. No peace , only noise of construction, no electricity.  Not worth spending. they charge for a 5 star property & serve as a 2 star.",1610shilpis,/Profile/1610shilpis,"New Delhi, India",10

pauri-garhwal,"foul mouthed, short tempered manager. Worst hospitality. Seems like uneducated rogue running the show, doing things at will. very disappointing after the trouble you take to reach this place. People with family just avoid. The manager can even get physical. Don't know how safe is this place.",Sunny169,/Profile/Sunny169,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",10
pauri-garhwal,"This is not a centrally located property, but may be tried if looking for a secluded getaway.  Quality and services are not great,however, the views and surroundings compensates to an extent.  Don't expect quick services and carry quick bites once you get back from the town.

pauri-garhwal,"I visited lansdowne with family of 6. We were in a mess because we didn't book the hotel before hand. So after reaching lansdowne we were searching for a place to stay. So with some local advice we went to this place. The 3km route to reach this hotel was so terrifying. We were in Hyundai I20 and Maruti swift. It felt like we would fall of the road any moment. I would suggest anyone traveling to this hotel in rainy season, BEWARE!! Its too dangerous. But then we reached somehow. The rates were too high for a night with no food included. The rooms were more like over priced tent houses. Also these guys don't even have their own kitchen. The owner was shaggy and dirty as hell. We came to know after wards that he was the owner. When we tried to bargain with the owner he took his",vijayanvipin,/Profile/vijayanvipin,"New Delhi, India",10
pauri-garhwal,"This place is inside the forest  Best for sunset watching  Don't forget to carry munches /booze from the local market before reaching there ,because once you reach there you will be too lazy to go back to the local market so .  Place is good for 1 night",Kartik A,/Profile/264kartika,,30
