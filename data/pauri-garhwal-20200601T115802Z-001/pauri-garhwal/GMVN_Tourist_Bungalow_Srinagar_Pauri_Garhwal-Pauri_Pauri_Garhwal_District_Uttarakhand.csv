pauri-garhwal,"Stay becomes nice with two factor experiences - room and staff. Staff wise an excellent hospitable people, especially the Manager Ms Vimala who went out of her way even to help us reorganise hotel every day for the next four days coordinating with GMVN on rescheduling, no words can express our thanks and appreciation for her, Staff very cordial and accommodating. Room wise it needs maintenance and also the property needs parking lot for the visitors/tourists. GMVN a trusted name for tourists needs to make investments in raising the quality and even they can raise the room tarrifs for the extra costs involved. Overall a great experience",RKNayak,/Profile/RKNayak,"Bangkok, Thailand",40
pauri-garhwal,"Probably your only choice to stay in Srinagar. The property is located on the main road. Overall maintenance is quite poor.  Stayed in the Delux rooms on 1st floor. Rooms are quite decent in size. Have window AC. Mine didnâ€™t really cool and all control knobs were not there so you have no way to set the temperature.   Restaurant service is extremely slow and breakfast is poorly prepared. Had to leave it.  The staff is friendly and nice. They do their best in whatever way they can, I guess.  Not worth for the Rs. 2700 that you pay for a room.   ",7099rishid,/Profile/7099rishid,"Mumbai, India",20

pauri-garhwal,"Yes, you can stay, better than many hotels in Shrinagar but not the best. only unique postitive point it has is the location. Right next to the bus stop, if you are travelling by public transport, it is a dream come true place for you. My experience is a little different, being a local of Uttarakhand, I bump into this place more often. Had to stay in Shrinagar for one day, my choice of stay was GMVN. I regret that decision. The hotel itself looks so shabby, I was amazed at this gargantuan waste of public property. There was a time when this hotel was a bright spot on the map of Shrinagar but now due to lack of maintenance this hotel has lost its sheen. One thing, personally, I couldn't complain about was food. The rooms were okay. Staff was cordial, I must say, unlike other",Harendra B,/Profile/HarendraB18,"Dehradun, India",30
pauri-garhwal,Stopped at Srinagar to have a tea break...surprisingly we got the food we wanted and decided to have brunch over there as it was in between breakfast and lunch...enjoyed the savoury and proceed to Rishikesh...thanks GMVN,AnupaSud,/Profile/AnupaSud,"Pune, India",50

pauri-garhwal,"On our way back from Joshimath to Rishikesh, we had booked GMVN Tourist House at Srinagar for 1 night's stay. We had stayed in GMVN Rest houses in other places like Haridwar, Rishikesh and Joshimath, they were all good. But, this was so badly maintained. We had booked 2 family rooms. The light switch in one of the rooms was giving shock. The bathroom door was not closing properly. Bedding was also not comfortable. When we were sharing our experience about this hotel to one of the local person, he was telling us that the rest houses at Rudraprayag or Devprayag would be better and the next time if we are making a visit, he advised us to book in either of those 2 which are closer to Srinagar instead of this one. This rest house had an in house restaurant where we had rotis and",Srinivasan S,/Profile/ssrini21,"Chennai, India",20

pauri-garhwal,"After a long strenuous journey and trekking in the Himalayas, I wanted to get down in Srinagar and rest for a night. As was advised, I went to the GMVN guest house near bus stand.  I approached the reception counter, who would not smile or care. I requested for a room.  And the no friendly receptionist said there is no water. Normal standard rooms have no water, only the high priced ones have water. And he directed me to go to the next private hotel available.  This is not the first time, I have experienced this. GMVN employees starving their employers of customers and directing them to near by private hotels for personal gains. The hotel remains empty. Customers are turned down and made to walk further with the luggage. Shame on them.  GMVN is a great organization. Corruption",anandcct1,/Profile/anandcct1,"Bengaluru, India",10
pauri-garhwal,"This property situated on main srinagar road so for convenience it is a big advantage near to all market, taxi stand and bus depot.  There is dire need to restore its old glory inside out.  Rooms are spacious and scary. Bathrooms states same story as rooms.  Prices for stay are quite reasonable depending on season in tune of 500 to 1500 INR room only.",Manandani,/Profile/Manandani,"Mumbai, India",20

pauri-garhwal,"This is a GMVN Hotel on the main road in Srinagar. The location is convenient as it is in the heart of town. The rooms are spacious and have TV. The dining hall in the restaurant is large. The hotel is good for those on a holiday with time to have leisurely meals.The staff are courteous.   There is a veg restaurant opposite this GMVN hotel where one can have a meal for a change.    If one walks to the right of the hotel and takes a side road up the hillside to the PWD Guest House, one gets a great view of Srinagar town and the Ganga from a height.",Vinod500,/Profile/Vinod500,"Bengaluru, India",30
pauri-garhwal,This is kinda old property I guess not frequented by tourists apart from gmvn bought ones. Situated on main road opp of bus depot so location is an advantage when it comes to convenience of food and travel.  Rooms are average and somewhat clean and spacious. Can be okay for overnight stay and much better than other available surrounded options. They do have attached restaurant which serves right from breakfast to dinner with limited availability of veg/ non-veg choices on menu.,chiragm1,/Profile/chiragm1,"Mumbai, India",30
pauri-garhwal,"This Guest House is run by the Government and suffers from the Typical BABU attitude. AC Rooms are large and comfortable, but the Service is very poor. Location is excellent - near the Bus Stand. Good place for an overnight halt",Sunilvk64,/Profile/Sunilvk64,"Ankleshwar, India",30
pauri-garhwal,"Stay Here for location as it is on the main road to Auli..neat and clean rooms. AC rooms are nice , dorm is value for money. The kitchen staff has good disposition and are always willing to make something for you for a small tip.   However remember , this is a government property and therefore they are inflexible in certain things. The food is standard GMVN fare , you can get good food across the road at the roadside which possibly explains why there is little choice.   Its a pity that government sits on such prime property and has little clue on how to manage it.

pauri-garhwal,"Stayed in the AC room for 1 night. Previously i have stayed in this hotel in other room (non AC). The AC rooms are big and have a front seating area. This eliminates the road noise in the room as this hotel is located directly on the main road. As for the food, it is standard GMVN stuff, basic dishes are on offer. However just across the road there is a good eating joint.",borntotravel123,/Profile/borntotravel123,"Noida, India",30
pauri-garhwal,we were 8 people and stayed for 1 night in the dormitory  while returning from auli to delhi. It was really clean and a good value for money for overnight halts. It was just about 110/head!!  the restaurant seemed nice though we ate in a restaurant opposite the hotel which had amazing north indian food!,shivi6,/Profile/shivi6,"Bengaluru, India",40
pauri-garhwal,I stayed here with family for one night in December end while coming back from Auli to Haridwar. As expected this is a modest hotel with basic necessities at good rates. Don't expect any luxury. We had dinner at a restaurant opposite the hotel and it was excellent. Though the hotel also had a full scale restaurant and it seemed that the food quality was good there but we prefer to dine outside. Service was also above average. Above all the location is central to the town which makes you reachable to every basic need whether it be restaurants or liquor shop (which is just besides the hotel)... and mind you this is one of the very few locations on the yatra route where you can find liquor....,Yuvraj3837,/Profile/Yuvraj3837,"Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India",30
pauri-garhwal,"I would like to share my worst experience of GMVN Srinagar (Uttarakhand ) . Worst Service . I booked one AD room on 15-06-2012 but AC was not working , and when I called reception no body picked my call , after half an hour my call was entertained and than night duty incharge Mr. Arya visted my room and he argued and misbehaved and suggested me to shift in Non AC room and when I requested him to call Manager he said manager is sleeping . After almost half an hour Manager mr. Gidliyal came to my room , and instead of getting AC repaired he also argued and tried to convince me that AC is working altghough AS was not working and he showed his deaf ear to my request .
