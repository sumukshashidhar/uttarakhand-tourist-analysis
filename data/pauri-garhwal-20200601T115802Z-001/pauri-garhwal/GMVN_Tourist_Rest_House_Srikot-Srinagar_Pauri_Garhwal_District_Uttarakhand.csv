Must compliment the well-behaved,humble and friendly team of staff here who maintains the cleanliness, hygiene of the place and clean bed and bath linen rarely seen in govt guest houses. They also served us dinner and morning tea. Thanking the manager Rawat ji, Arun ji and other staffs for our comfortable stay. Vivek .",vivek1vivs,/Profile/vivek1vivs,"New Delhi, India",50
