pauri-garhwal,"We stayed in June 19 while our visit to Badrinath. The only reason I booked this resort for its location. To the surprise, it exceeded my expectations. The location is awesome, just facing the rage of mother Ganga river. The sound of rapid water can be heard from the room. We booked family room which was huge with 2 bedrooms, 2 washrooms and living room with tv. The rooms are well maintained and clean. The only drawback I found is there is no mode of communication available.No intercom, No mobile network or internet.They also help you to arrange River rafting at economical Govt approved rates.",Rishikesh,/Profile/RishikeshP31,"Greater Noida, India",40
pauri-garhwal,"We stayed this camp for one night while returning from Badrinath.  This is situated at a very prime location.   Please note that there are monkeys which enter the log huts, if the gate is not closed properly. These enter into the restaurant area also. We faced both the situations. In fact, from the restaurant a big monkey took away food from our table while we were eating there.",Avinash_H,/Profile/Avinash_H,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
pauri-garhwal,This place is one of the best place to stay near rishikesh. It is situated around 40km from rishikesh main town and that makes it perfect getaway. Homestay is very clean and staff is very friendly and helpful. If you don't like hustle bustle of the city then don't stay in rishikesh just drive down for 45mins and here it is GMVN kaudiyala homestay situated in the bank's of ganga.,194nts,/Profile/194nts,"Mumbai, India",50

pauri-garhwal,"Hi Guys, I had visited this place in the month of May 2018 with my family. Our main destination was KEDARNATH and this property comes on the way. It is 40 km from Rishikesh City and situated on the bank of river GANGA  Anyone who prefers less crowded & peaceful stay than this is the right choice. The best part of this property is it is far away from city and located between the mountains which results to calm & pleasant environment.

There is also Garden area in front of the rooms where you can sit and experience the serenity. Manager of the property Mr. Ajay Pal Khandari. is very helpful.
