pauri-garhwal,"On dec 8th ,2019, we friends along with family had a camping here . Everything is hassle free and in camp everything is superlative , including staff's behaviour and food , so many activities to do.. trekking , taking customers to Another side of Ganga and personal touch of the camp owners. Just one thing may be improved , that is ,there are no much visible sign boards for the camp on road. We went 2 kms ahead of location in search of the way. Rest all r good and would recommend this for sure.",Govind S,/Profile/imgoso,,50
pauri-garhwal,"!!..Located just on the banks of Ganga river, Camp Aqua Ganga is just the perfect camp to unwind yourself in the lap of nature , away from the hustle bustle of mainstream but offering all amenities in its well maintained luxury & spacious tents with attached washroom.We enjoyed the beach volleyball.It offers perfect hospitality with courteous staff. The camp staff also arranged trekking & rafting for us and guided us all through. It was just a perfect rejuvenating holiday & Camp Aqua Ganga made it simply awesome with its home like delicious food & great value for moneyâ€¦. !!",Renu,/Profile/Renu0135,"Dehradun District, India",50
