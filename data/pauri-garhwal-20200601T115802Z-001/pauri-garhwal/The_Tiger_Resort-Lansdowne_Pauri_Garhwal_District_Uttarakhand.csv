pauri-garhwal,"The choice of tiger resort can be summed up in one word:awesome .The place is worth the money because of its location.The view of the sky from the resort is one of a kind.The resort was taken care by one uncle who was warm and friendly .Cant forget to mention Mukesh Bhaiya who was extremely sweet in ensuring that the stay went well.One would be satisfied by the quality of food prepared and decent rooms. You can stay at this place all day long with friends, family and you wont regret at all.My friend also found a cute little dog Kalli that she had seen an year back at that same place.Go stay at this place and relish your Maggie too.",poornima n,/Profile/poorniman341,,50
pauri-garhwal,"we visited Tiger Resort in 1st Week of July with family , Resort is located on beautiful location , where one can see glimpls of Lansdowne and other towns, Rooms are good , food was tasty and my kids had fun having food in open cottage style restaurant Tiger Cafe, Clouds were coming inside room . Owner Mr R.C. Khantwal was friendly and took care of each & every thing , even provided medicines to me as i had some fever, will surely visit again to this resort in winters",aavivek,/Profile/aavivek,,50
pauri-garhwal,"We visited & stayed here in June 2017. The location of resort is at very good place with full of greenery, healthy & peaceful environment. Normal simple rooms with good view, the food is very tasty & food quality gives you feeling like having home cooked food. You will feel like a Digital detoxification as there is no phone connection & no internet connection (only BSNL services are available). The Owners & staff are very courteous & helpful. You can enjoy awesome weather, trekking area, exploring nature & Birding. If you are lucky to have Drizzling during your stay then it feels like you are staying in heaven. Must visit.... Perfect place to spend time with your family & friends.",Sachin T,/Profile/248sachint,"Ghaziabad, India",50
pauri-garhwal,The Tiger resort is located on a different route than to Lansdowne. But this is an awesome place to stay. Tarkeshwar temple is 12 kms away from this stay and a must visit place. Let's come to the Tiger Resort review. The rooms are big and well maintained. The crowd is less and that's what you expect when you're visiting a hill station. The service and hospitality is great. The old uncle who is an ex-army man i guess runs this area and an old lady who prepares nice and delicious food on demand. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. On request they arranged a bonefire for us despite the fact that it rained and somehow they managed to light it up. Overall a great experience and would recommend anyone if going that way to stay and have a quality time with friends and family.,ANKIT S,/Profile/ankits417,,40
pauri-garhwal,"I am late in writing this review due to busy schedule. Best place to be in Lansdowne. Yes it is 25 KM away from proper Lansdowne but the location wort traveling additional 50 km. The pace is run by a family that respects there gusts . Yes most important I would like to give reply to some of the review above. 1.Yes this place does not have TV, WiFi and 4g and that good if you want to spend quality time with your family and friends.  2. Yes the food is little bit expensive and prepared by a old lady with some helper. The food is tasty and fresh as it is prepared on demand basis for which one can spend extra penny.  3.Yes there is less crowd in the hotel but if u like crow you should go to metropolitan cities not to Hill stations.  4. Some has mentioned that the old man is greedy",Himanshu T,/Profile/616himanshut,,50
pauri-garhwal,"Don't think ""resort"" is the word I'll use for this place . Its an extremely budget hotel, with decent rooms and very basic amneties. Electricity is a bit of an issue, but I assume thats a persistent problem in that area. That being said, the place is tucked away in a cozy spot. Theres an amazing view of the mountains and forests from almost every corner. Tarekeshwar temple is only 13km away and is a must visit.The staff and manager is extremely helpful  and well mannered. They organize  treks on request as well. Food is pretty good, if not great. The place has extreme potential. Best wishes for the team!",Tanushree D,/Profile/64tanushreed,,30
pauri-garhwal,Nice place and hotel...budget hotel with good food which one may hardly found in mountain area.

pauri-garhwal,I visited the Tiger Resort on the 20-21 May. As i was looking for a calm and scenic place away from all the usual rush so this place served my purpose. This resort is situated around 25 km away from Lansdowne  with picturesque landscape and pure aroma of nature.  Will strongly recommend it to those who look forward to take break from the usual routine. The place doesn't have wifi or other cellular connectivity so you will have ample time to rediscover & reclaim yourself rather than living in the virtual reality of whatsapp & FB. Overall it is a decent place with basic facilities and freshly cooked food with amiable staff especially Mr. Khantwal who is also the owner of the place. ,Sandeep S,/Profile/SandeepS2686,,30
pauri-garhwal,We saw this place on our way to The tarkeshwar temple and decided to stop here on our way back for a cup of hot tea.. and that turned out to be a very good decision we made during the entire trip..the Veg Maggi and the parathas at this place were the best..I never found better ones..hot parathas topped with dollops of butter and hot tea was just what we needed on a cold cold day..and the owner was super sweet telling us all stories of the place..we definitely had a great time and we were glad we stopped by this place!!!!,captsagarmurthy,/Profile/captsagarmurthy,"Mumbai, India",50
pauri-garhwal,"The resort is 25-30 kms away from Lansdowne. The route is full of landslides, water flowing through roads, prone to accidents. Property is highly mismanaged by the greedy non professional owner. No staff available, owner himself serves food  in every room. There is no cook in fact. The owner's wife make food for everyone. Food is delicious and very expensive. Almost double of the price. You can not see anyone in the hotel except the owner and his wife. No TV, no phone connection, no network available, geyser hardly works. The owner also pases personal comments. Room price is very high compared to the amenities provided.

pauri-garhwal,"Had gone there some time back. The property is located in a very peacfull location, clean and pleasent.  This resort has basic amenities, rooms are moderate and can show some great view but beside that there is nothing more to appreciate.  Kitchen needs a lot of upgradation, lack of staff and distance from nearest city is the contributing factor.  Prices charged are very high compared to service rendered.  Over all it is an AVERAGE resorts where the managment has to improve a lot.  Mr khantwal specially needs to look into this.  Anuj  ",Anujsharmae5,/Profile/Anujsharmae5,,30
pauri-garhwal,This place is an hour from Lansdowne and you should stay here only if you want to stay far from the crowd. Very scenic and peaceful. It is low on amenities. There is just one care-taker who is responsible for almost everything. For us it was a pleasant stay though I would have liked to stay nearer to Lansdowne.,686sanchitm,/Profile/686sanchitm,"New Delhi, India",40
pauri-garhwal,If you are looking for a luxury resort it is nothing like that. 25kms away from Lansdowne in a secluded place. No TV no mobile tower. Small rooms not much amenities in room. Food is served on order from their restaurant. Food is good. But if you are searching for a peaceful place in the lap of nature it's beautiful. Have a beautiful surrounding. Tarkeshwar temple is 10km from here. Other attractions are very far away. ,niasa,/Profile/niasa,"Navi Mumbai, India",30
pauri-garhwal,"This is 25 Kms away from lansdowne on the way to Tarkeshwar Temple. Wonderful landscape totally misused by non professional greedy owner. In proper lansdowne better rooms are half the rate. Food offered is also more than double the rate compared to lansdowne hotels. The socalled restaurant is a shaded place with plastic tables and chairs. Service dhaba style. Room could not be locked from inside. Furnishing: simple double bed, the cabinet was a wooden box with no shelf, no rod , no hangers. 2 plastic chairs, 1 plastic stool, geyser  non functional, water in taps at whims and fancy of the owner to fill the tank, no TV,   Behaviorial problem of the owner.",pbhattacharya1,/Profile/pbhattacharya1,"Faridabad, India",10
pauri-garhwal,"The resort is on the way to Tarkeshwar  temple & the only resort you would find on the way. No wonder all the rooms are occupied by default.   The view from our room balcony was amazing. The sunset was really beautiful.  The room is very basic with minimal or no  amenities whatsoever. Though you would connect with each other as there is no phone connection, net connection, tv, etc. So you would have ample of time to do just nothing.  The food is just average. He served us paneer dish with very little quantity.  The owner it seems just wants to save the last penny which shows in everything though the rates of everything are high.",Ankita S,/Profile/AnkitaGulati1,,30
pauri-garhwal,"While visiting Tarkeshwar Mahadev temple, stopped at the Tiger Cafe. Had regular North Indian food, Shahi Paneer , Dal and rotis. Food was good but bit on the higher side.  you could get the same food in any part of Lansdowne for 2/3 rd of the price.  Good place to have Maggi and some beverages and carry on.  Did not go inside of the Resort though, but it is located beautifully with a great view of the valley.",Saurabh S,/Profile/821saurabhs,"New Delhi, India",30

pauri-garhwal,I went to tiger report in dashara holidays with family. First of all with the name Tiger resort you feel that lot of place inside the premises of the resort But nothing is there. only basic rooms are available. They mentioned in the website that they have track for cycling but nothing is there. They don't allow to take the dinner inside the room. You have to take the dinner out side open area in cold weather. Have very less staff . I will not recommend any one this place to stay with family.,rajatagarwal1997,/Profile/rajatagarwal1997,"Hyderabad, India",20
pauri-garhwal,"Located 20 km from Lansdowne on the Tarkeshwar Road this property sneaks out on your left from behind the tall trees at a bend on the road when you are progressively getting impatient thinking when we shall arrive for the first time travelers on this road.  If you are expecting amenities and treatment at par to a 5 star property wherein you get a valet parking, bell boy carrying your baggage to your room etc. etc. etc. then do not go there. This place is meant for enthusiastic travelers looking forward to escape from the ""Hustle and Bustle"" of city life to have a rendezvous with Mother Nature.  The room we got was spacious probably 12' x 15', thinly furnished (which I liked) with a double bed, a side table, two chairs, a cupboard.

pauri-garhwal,"It is 20 -25 kms away from Lansdowne City, near to Tarkeshwar Temple, located at the edge of the mountain has a fantastic view, I must say its better to stay here than hotels/resorts in Lansdowne since Lansdowne is bit congested but this resort is located away from the city, hence peaceful. The place is so very neat and maintained. Amazing food, awesome view. Great hospitality was extended to us and food was good.  Improvements:- Only one, since the place is quite cold, please keep new quilt in rooms :) I talked with owners and they took my suggestion seriously and said yes to make improvements, hence gave complete 5 stars.",Vivek1990,/Profile/Vivek1990,"New Delhi, India",50

pauri-garhwal,"I would love to say that Tiger Resort is one of the best Resorts i have come across at any of the hill stations in India.  Firstly, the food at the hotel was pretty awesome. Secondly, the staff was extremely helpful and courteous. They really made the stay comfortable. Thirdly, the environment of the resort was really worth while. The rooms, the lawns, Though it is little bit away from the main town, but really a ideal place to spend a few days with 'home-away-home' feeling.  I recommend this hotel for everyone whether be a honey mooing couple or a family gathering.",PraveenM999,/Profile/PraveenM999,"New Delhi, India",50

pauri-garhwal,I m a frequent visitor to Lansdowne and Tarkeshwar that’s the reason I went to ur resort for the 2nd time in less than 2 months. But this time I felt really annoying after visiting as I made a mistake of my life after taking my office colleagues to ur resort.   At the end of the stay when I asked about the 5 star bills which was given to me that the service was not good and we were denied small things like Soap and Towels and moreover it was asked (KI AAP LOG APNE NAI LAAYE) u guys haven’t got urs. I think u have just stepped in the service industry and the response is more than enough to make it viral on youtube and social media. As when I was speaking to the person he bluntly said to one of my fellow ki kis tarah ka ganda aadmi laaye ho apne saath. These kind of responses,Vikas2652,/Profile/Vikas2652,"New Delhi, India",10
pauri-garhwal,"Literally In the middle of Nowhere on the Landsdowne - tarkeshwar temple road, was actually quite surprised to find a hotel on this route. The rooms are spacious. Being a less frequented place the bed linens were a bit dusty.  There is a tiger cafe attached to the hotel, and simple and basic food is prepared by the Locals there. With absolutely no Mobile Phone reception, opt for this place if u want to be absolutely cut off from the world and be at peace for a while.   Quite a unexpored place, one can always explore the hill trails around this place.",Veepy,/Profile/Veepy5,"Bengaluru, India",30
