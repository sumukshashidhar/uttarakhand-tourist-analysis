pauri-garhwal,"Terrible...Pathetic...  1. Location - 3KM from Main Road on a katcha wicket. Not scary but need to drive carefully.   Resort is surrounded by Forest from  one side and Open Mountain from another side.  It was very windy weather for 2 days, can't do much outside activities.  2. Room Amenities - Just a Bed, CRT TV and Table Chair. No Almirah, Dressing etc. It doesn't even have a landline to call room service. Go to reception and place order if you want to have anything.  Taps are leaking, doors are cracking and ceiling ready to fall on our head.  Even noticed for first time, shower just above the commode, maybe they want us to shower while sitting on commode.  3. Management - Management seems to be very pathetic. They were always fighting with employees.   We were not served",Saurabh_G0yal,/Profile/Saurabh_G0yal,"New Delhi, India",10
pauri-garhwal,"I had visited Lansdowne for a short 2 day trip. Hill View Shantiraj Resort is an isolated resort located around 3.5 kms from Lansdowne Market. The management gave me a nice discount for my stay. The manager came to collect me on his bike at the Lansdowne bus stop. I reached the resort in around 15 minutes with this bike ride. The best part of this resort is its peaceful location, with views of mountains on both sides (East and West).  I sat in the garden for both breakfast and lunch. In the afternoon, the manager sent me with his kid to a spring (small waterfall) around 20 minutes walking distance from the resort. People would enjoy taking a dip in this spring as the water seemed fresh and shallow. In the night I was served with some chicken for dinner.

pauri-garhwal,This hotel is located way out of the city and deep into the dense wood.. the only road connecting the hotel and the city is almost a challenging off-roading track..  There is no other habitation nearby this place as it is situated on top on a mountain and you can see the other mountain ranges.. Full points to its location and hospitality.. Trust me the food is soo yummy and delicious and the campfire site is one of the best I've ever seen..  You can opt for going to the dense forest at midnight to make your journey remembering forever if you live through it as you might meet few cheetah's while tracking..

The resort staff are very friendly and will instantly make you feel at home. A little expensive for the quality, but if you compare with other resorts, it is standard.

There will be small limited menu in the kitchen because they do not have running restaurant here. They will prepare food as per your order. Food order may take close to 1 hr to be prepared as everything is prepared once you place the order.  You can have evening snacks in thr open area enjoying the beautiful sunset here.

Park your car in the Landsdowne central parking lot and take a cab from there. Should charge you around Rs. 300 for taking there. There is a 3 km stretch that is both worth driving (if you lack other adventures in life) and not worth it (if you have other things to die for). 2. Dont expect a spick and spam room.

Initially when i drove down to this place the road was bit rough and we got a bit worried. but when we finally landed at this resort the location was excellent and walk in the clouds was awesome. Tt was gorgeous to see the clouds passing through our room at the dawn. The staff was very nice to us and made our stay very comfortable. The food was good and location ultimate. I had an acute pain in stomach, thanks to the Owner Mr. tyagi who took me to hospital in his own car and got my treatment done. How often would you see that.... the owner himself takes you for the medical care.  It was like a home away from home. Thank you Mr. tyagi for your timely help.

pauri-garhwal,"We were over to Shani Raj resort last weekend. however, it is wrong to say Resort, this place is more of a lodge with basic room with attached toilets. The rent of Rs.2000 per night is expensive as compared to the room. Food and service is good and food is made to order. The staff and hospitality was excellent though. Kid enjoyed the place with rabbits all around and some regular rides and few adventurous rides. Since this place is located last on the jungle road it is very quite and in the middle of the nature. Sunset is beautiful and bonfire during the evening with music (speaker and USB drive with songs provided) makes the evening. If you would like to relax in nature this is a good place. Do not have high. Hopes with the accomodation",htandon,/Profile/htandon,"New Delhi, India",30
pauri-garhwal,"last week we had been in lansdowne and stayed in hotel shanti raj hill view resort. i really don't understand why it is called A HOTEL.it doesn't have the minimum feature of a hotel. rooms are not well-kept,nor it has proper locking system. bathroom goes without any lock.towels are stinking. over and above the road leading to shanti raj from gandhi chowk was horribly narrow and rocky all the way.even an expert driver would hesitate to drive there safely. but apart from this the location is very beautiful especially the sunset view is worth seeing.and surrounding pine trees will take your breath.",sumita100,/Profile/sumita100,"Faridabad, India",20

pauri-garhwal,"I went to Shantiraj hill resort with my family and had a very enjoyable experience. As travelers we are not very fussy about the hotel since we are budget travelers and are always looking for a good deal even if it means putting up with some inconveniences. The approach road to the hotel comes from within the main market area and is a little tricky especially if you have a big SUV or are not accustomed to driving in the hills, however the resort is well worth this effort. The view from the resort is very nice and gets even better if one treks along to the nearby areas (we got really nice pictures of the sunset) . The food is decent (nothing great) but the hospitality from the owner is really nice, he even served us some local delicacies on our request.

pauri-garhwal,"We visited ""Hill View ShantiRaj Resort"" in August dated 10th . We had a wonderful experience staying in valley for 3 days. We both have visited many hill stations but never got the chance to stay in valley. Although the place was 3 km from market, but we found our-self  very near to nature. That place was awesome, very fresh n clean atmosphere. The staff was so friendly, and the food was just like homemade. I thing every possible thing was there, whether it is small outdoor games (like badminton, ludo etc ) or some sporty games (Bermuda bridge, zip-lining... Night becomes more attractive when you have terrific weather, a camp fire, music n what else a glass of your drink......... It's a nice place to visit.

pauri-garhwal,Recently i stayed at Hill View Shantiraj Resort Lansdowne. The stay was  unforgettable. I went on 10th aug. and stayed there for four days. you can see the valley of green long trees of pine.I have visited many hill view resorts but never had so much fun anywhere that I had here.  The view was just divine!!! I have never seen such a friendlier staff  before. The campfire just the thing needed in such a beautiful weather. The food quality was also great.Over  all  it was a great & unique experience  for the city people.A great place to forget all our worries & enjoy the nature at it's best.I would like to go again & again & recommend to  all my friends,Ravi P,/Profile/RaviP431,"Gurgaon, Haryana, India",50
pauri-garhwal,"The approach to the resort is very dangerous. The road is very rocky, slippery and narrow. Infact we did not dare to go anywhere in our cars once we reached the resort. We had an aria and a safari. The approach road is unmotorable and certainly not worth the risk.  The main course food is good, but everything else is average or below average. Non veg was terrible. Breakfast egg was oily. Paranthas and maggi were decent. The food is expensive for such a place.  The place is however neat, and bathrooms are clean. The surrounding forest is very nice, and one can just walk. This is last resort on the forest road, so very peaceful. We took a mountain trail walk to a waterfall with the owner, and the waterfall had lovely water. The trek was a little tricky though.

pauri-garhwal,We went to this hotel on last weekend of June 2012. First hotel manager cancelled our bookings as hotel was getting a bulk bookings and when we showed our displeasure they simply asked for Rs 2200/night for a single room against the basic rent of Rs 700/night. People from cities come to such places for peace and to see nature's scenic beauty but hotel staff put loud speakers in night which they kept playing for late nights.,punia0084,/Profile/punia0084,"New Delhi, India",10

Had to reach on my own. The room rent was charged as Rs 2000 per room and as we were 4 couples, had booked 4 rooms. When cheked with the other visiters, we discovered that we were over charged by rs 500 per room. Rooms were not very good, toilet cammode leaks.

pauri-garhwal,"When we went to Lansdowne, we did not know anything about the place, but sure dint want to stay at any of the commercialised place. So we looked up online and found this place ""Shanti Raj Resort"". When we discussed with friends, we found out that some of them had been to this place and really liked it. So we finalised it. When we reached there, we were welcome by 2 very simple looking men. We thought they might be the care-takers, but it turned out that these people were the owners! They told us that they had cut the mountains with their own hands to make this place look like a resort! WOW! Anyway, this place has 5 double bed rooms, with attached washrooms. The owners are 2 brothers who are there one at a time and 2 other guys to help them. When we were ther, i asked them if i",TrotterGirl,/Profile/TrotterGirl,"New Delhi, India",50
