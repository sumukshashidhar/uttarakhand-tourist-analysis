Check-in was pretty easy, no bothers there. The room and the bathroom both were perfectly clean and spacious with good quality furnishings.

pauri-garhwal,‚Äò Ravine Palace - a Luxury Hotel ‚Äò board welcomes you. The front as well as the building is plain with no attempt to merge with environment. It is an eye sore. What saves it  is the view from the rooms facing the valley as was our room  503.You could sit in the balcony and watch the distant mountains . It is really peaceful. The room was spacious as was also bath room. There is a good balcony. The room is clean with lot of space to put away our  baggage. People are cooperative . That does not compensate for many issues that arose in our stay  Restaurant is ok and food ordinary. Many dishes were tasteless  Room service is good  People are cooperative but I feel they are untrained.  Unfortunately that was not all. We found human hair in the plate.

It was a very comfortable stay with nice temperature in the month of may when peak summer roast you at delhi. I found Mr Upendra at reception who was very helping.  Few tips :  1) the place is ideal for couples who want to spend peaceful time away from work. Children may not enjoy the place.  2) keep enough cash with you as due to the network problem cards may not work here. Only couple of ATMs are there that too I found not working.  3) please aks your close ones not to be disturbed if your phone is not reachable as it will due to network issues.
