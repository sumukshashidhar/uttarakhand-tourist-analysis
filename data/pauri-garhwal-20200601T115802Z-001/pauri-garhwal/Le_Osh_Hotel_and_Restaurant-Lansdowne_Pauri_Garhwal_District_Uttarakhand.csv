pauri-garhwal,"I had a great experience staying at this place. A variety of rooms to choose from. It's better to buy a ""with-food"" package as the food is very good. We were three people and the food quantity could have served 5 easily.  Rooms are cozy and well ventilated. Room service is great. The staff and the owners are very helpful. All the tourist points are within 2 to 4 KMS from the hotel. 100% recommend. ",Adventure828367,/Profile/Adventure828367,,50
pauri-garhwal,"Lansdowne is a quiet place to relax your mind and have a nice getaway to a hill station from Delhi. Le Osh hotel is a budget hotel in the the mid of Lansdowne. It has a beautiful park infront where people can relax. Lansdowne all-together is a quiet and calm place. There are a limited places to see like Bhulla Lake, Tip-n-top point. The food offered by the hotel is really nice. You should try the Pahaadi Chicken offered by them, its really nice.",Vibhor M,/Profile/vibhorm818,,30
pauri-garhwal,"I booked this hotel in advance and little disappointed with the choice. Plus point is its location is at the main market, staff is good, room was clean. First of all its not a proper hotel it looks like a make shift arrangement to cash the location of property. Hotel is not managed professionally, I think its a new hotel. Check in took me half an hour.  We didn't use the restaurant and next day shifted to Fairy Dale..",Makar,/Profile/Makar2005,"Ghaziabad, India",30
pauri-garhwal,"It was a Bullet ride trip to Lansdowne. We pre-booked this hotel for 8 people however due to some last minute changes in our plan 2 bikers got out of plan. Hotel guys very comfortably adjusted our stay as per our updated requirements. I am thankful to these guys for understanding the situation.  We got 2 interconnected rooms where 1 family suit with Valley view (occupancy of 4) and 1 deluxe room (occupancy of 2). We reached there at around 3 o'clock and as we opened the window, clouds came inside the room. It looked awesome.  We were hungry so they took our order and served lunch in the room on request. Would like to highlight that FOOD WAS AWESOME!!!(both Veg and Non-Veg).  Below are the my views:  PROS: -- Neat and Clean rooms and lavatory -- Dining hall is hygienic --",Rajesh12june,/Profile/Rajesh12june,"Greater Noida, India",50
pauri-garhwal,I recently visited to Lansdowne and it was a BIKE RIDE....Dug Dug Dug. We booked this hotel online and they very pleasantly adjusted as per our requirements as we were 6 bikers and we just need Cool Stay and Tasty Food(+Drinks :P ). They have provided us with interlinked 2 rooms with 2 double beds and a single bed. My rooms has a valley view and clouds were entering our room if window opened.  We reached around 3 o'clock and was very hungry. They took our order and served in room as per our request and one thing i must say that FOOD WAS AWESOME(both veg and non-veg). So now summarizing few pros and cons of hotel:  Pros: --Neat and Clean and sort of homely environment. --Neat and Hygienic dining hall. --Nice Staff with perfect room service. --Own restaurant with nominal rates,ritesh_14887,/Profile/ritesh_14887,"New Delhi, India",50

pauri-garhwal,"I went to Lansdown and stayed in GMVN Tip N Top. But due to network prblm had to shift to mkt area. After gone through internet select this hotel and called to owner and select family suit. After unpacking the luggage I realized that this is not the right place to stay. No room service, no food not even a cup of tea. Bathroom without lock from outside, opened always. Very serious flaw..A big hole in wooden roof repaired with glass. If god forbid glass get broken, will fall on the pillow and sleeping person will definetly seriously hurt will never stay here.",Ranasurinder,/Profile/Ranasurinder,,10
pauri-garhwal,Me and my family had been to Lansdowne in the month of april 2014 .when it was boiling in Pune we decided to move to  Lansdowne. Lansdowne is really cool and beautiful place.

Every delicacies was mouth watering especially the chicken Items and served very fresh and hot.still after 3-4 months the favour and aroma of the foods is still fresh.

pauri-garhwal,"We (two couples) visited Lansdowne & stayed at Le Osh Hotel...  It is not like any modern hotel. It was residence earlier, so it is built like a hill village house but with modern facilities. service was very quick. it has two types of rooms - 1. one double-bed room & 2. two rooms each with one double-bed but one combined bathroom (family room). co-owner lady was very helpful. food, both veg & non-veg, was excellent. pahari-chicken also available.  only negative point : doesn't have any good scenery view. I don't have inner pics of this hotel but I have some scenery views.",AkashRawat,/Profile/AkashRawat,"New Delhi, India",40
pauri-garhwal,"The best part of this hotel is its location. It is located in the centre of city which allows you to move all of the renowned places of lansdowne without using teh car and thereby exploring the mountains. The hotel is an average one only with rooms being clean but with only basic amneties. Charges are descent and food offered is good. In case if someone is looking for staying at a hotel for sleep only, then this is indeed the best place. If there is a requirement of luxury or even deluxe stay, then the hotel will not fulfill the criteria.",FarazKid,/Profile/FarazKid,"New Delhi, India",30
pauri-garhwal,"We had an impromptu trip to Lansdowne on 8th June. Reached there late afternoon..I was amazed to see that there were no rooms available in any of the good hotels, except Kasang which was a little far back. We've given it a try at Le Osh and pleased to hear yes. this being last minute on the spot booking, last room numbered 1 was allotted.  Room is quite small and average on interiors. I couldn't got a chance to see other rooms which other reviewers has rated high. Food and service was quick and good.The charge calculation was a little peculiar here- they charged per head buffet which was all inclusive of room, dinner, tea and breakfast. It seemed a bit expensive though given the room type size and decor and that we had a 9 yr old charged full fare.  Overall , a good experience",kcpdelhi,/Profile/kcpdelhi,"New Delhi, India",40
pauri-garhwal,Restaurant (& hotel) is a family run business. The couple are very friendly and keep on interacting with guests to make sure they are comfortable. We didn't stay there - so can't comment upon rooms. We had couple of meals which were good considering that Lansdowne itself is such a small town with no big hotels or renowned food chains. ,NS_chd,/Profile/NS_chd,Chandigarh,30
pauri-garhwal,"usually me and my family visit Lansdowne in the month of May and stay at my favourite hotel. Hotel's name I wont mention. But this year on 16th , we reached Landsdowne midnight. since Le-osh Hotel is near to the market we decided to stay at Le-osh Hotel. Fortunately one room was just vacant and we got that.  Guys if u plan to stay at Le-osh hotel please make prior booking as theres always rush.  After staying Le-osh Hotel I have changed my favourite hotel list. first Is now Le-osh hotel as ambience of the hotel is historical,my room was very clean and well managed. the manager was very helpful and sanity is his first priority. Amazing food especially the chicken Items. we can have food in the children's park too.  we spend a wonderful 4 days in Landsdowne and in Le-osh Hotel.",mee45,/Profile/mee45,"New Delhi, India",50

May being the hottest month of the year and this time it was wrost, I and my family decided to visit Lansdowne.This decision and the stay in Le-osh Hotel  was a life saver as the place is really beautiful and hotel was awesome. Some time it happens that the place is beautiful and hotels are not that comfortable. But this time both was amazing. This vacation was unforgettable. Beautiful secenary and pampering services.  The Hotel staff were very energetic. any order placed, would reach in minutes.Rooms are absolutely clean and well maintained.

pauri-garhwal,"I did not book any hotel in advance before leaving for Lansdowne. So, after finding few good hotels fully packed on long weekend, Le Osh manager offered us a 2 bed small house adjacent to hotel. This House was having 2 rooms, to reach second room you have to pass through first room, so good for could with small children but not good for two couples. Also there was only one restroom attached to inner bed room. Price I paid was slightly more for a hotel of this type but it included dinner, breakfast, evening tea and milk for kids. Service was terrible for dinner but it was good during breakfast. Restaurent manager was having reasons for bad service during dinner (not sure how genuine it was). Best thing about the hotel is it's location and food. If manager's reason for terrible",Hobo6432,/Profile/Hobo6432,"Noida, India",30
pauri-garhwal,"I went their last weekend and I could find a room in this Hotel only as others were full and few were very far. This hotel is just at 5 minutes walking distance from the Lansdowne bus stop. There are very few eating points option available in Lansdowne, but we were lucky to stay at Le Osh. The food quality was awesome, specially pahadi chicken and paneer lababdar. The people were very soft spoken, supportive and caring. Room was also good. We covered tip n top, bhulla taal, army mess area and few other views just by walk from there. You don't need to hire taxi to have sight view.
