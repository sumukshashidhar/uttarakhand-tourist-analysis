pauri-garhwal,We landed around 9: 30 and despite our request there was no food for us. finally we had to struggle for food. there is no restaurant and heater available. This is not even a hotel but a local Mithaiwala (Sweetshop). lot of fumes and no cleanliness. better see some other place. ,Sunit R,/Profile/sunitraj,Delhi,10

pauri-garhwal,I have stayed in this Hotel from 31 oct to 2 nov 2016. i have booked 3 bedded room through OYO which cost me rs 1400/ night including breakfast for 3 persons. The food quality was excellent rates are reasonable. Location of the Hotel was in the main market just near to gandhi chock. Hotel staff was cooperative.Internal decoration and items are good. wifi speed was very good. which was provided complimentary. The only negative thing was Car Parking. I parked my car at Gandhi chock without any parking charges.,sharadtayal1972,/Profile/sharadtayal1972,"Ghaziabad, India",40
