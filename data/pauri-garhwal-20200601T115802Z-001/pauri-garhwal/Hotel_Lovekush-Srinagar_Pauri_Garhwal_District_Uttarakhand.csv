pauri-garhwal,"Stayed a night in package tour 2 years ago at end of Char Dham. Had decent spacious rooms, good food and OK service. I didn't find cause to complain. Now it has become an OYO hotel so will need online booking from OYO. Back then it was independent. service was not fast could have been better.",Vikas B,/Profile/VikasB655,,30
pauri-garhwal,"Small rooms, smaller bathrooms, not even basic amenities. This is one property that's best avoided. You need to switch off the geyser to get cold water. If you need to use the shower, you can't take your hand off the nozzle. Cos the moment you do that, the shower goes off. We thought that was just a malfunctioning shower in our room. But it turned out that this is a permanent feature across rooms. The location is the only good thing about this hotel.",byasanand,/Profile/byasanand,"New Delhi, India",20
