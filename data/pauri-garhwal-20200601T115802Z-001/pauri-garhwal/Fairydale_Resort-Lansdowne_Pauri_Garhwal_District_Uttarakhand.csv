To experience the beauty of this place, you need to visit it actually. It’s at the centre of Lansdowne but yet far — nestled in the midst of pine forest. We were five friends who visited and stayed in the four-bedded suite. May be one of the best rooms I have stayed in. It was humongous. The hotel, though over a century old, is well maintained.

It was tough to sit outside for dinner etc. You should solve that with some spray etc. - If you want to sit outside, enjoy the view/weather and have a drink, then sorry that's not allowed by hotel so you will have to sit inside the room only. that's the rule they",bediamit,/Profile/bediamit,"New Delhi, India",40

Pin drop silence on the road except for the army trucks that accost you now and then. The roads are a walkers dream - nothing exciting - just plain old solid quiet roads. The air is so fresh that it damages you. Fairydale is basic in terms of amenities. The rooms are just about stay-able. Hygiene is iffy but not seriously so - somebody obsessive may have a problem.

We took a spontaneous trip just carrying our rucksack and arrived in Lansdowne without making any reservations.   Fairydale is quite rightly rated as #1 in Lansdowne as other options are either too far away or not upto the mark.   Facts about Lansdowne: 1.) 250 Kms away from Delhi, it's a 6 hour drive in normal conditions. Road is by and large good (be sure to take Khatauli route near Meerut, not Mawana) 2.) Lansdowne is UNLIKE any other typical hill station. There is no mall road, not much for shopping and not much commerce here. It's a sleepy Army Cantonment area and you may even pass it by.

Nice location, awesome foods, courteous staff, amazing location ( the way is very narrow, driver should be skilled but once you reach there it is really beautiful). We clicked some photo with pluto ( I have never seen such a cute and calm doggy). The food they served in breakfast, lunch, snacks and  dinner was very good, specially paratha  in breakfast and pakoda in snacks. Get up early in the morning, sit in the midst of pine trees, enjoy the beauty of nature and have a cup of coffee with bread toast.

pauri-garhwal,"Fairydale is a mix package but overall it falls short of some basic expectations. First of all - the Positives: LOCATION : is not bad. Its just next to the GMVN Tourism Hotel and there is some greenery in the surroundings. However it is situated in lower part of Lansdowne so its warm out there in peak summers. The GMVN Huts at Tiffin Top have better location as per views and altitude. They are much cooler.  STAFF : is very good and responsive. FOOD : is nice and service is also good and fast. They also serve outside in the open area outside the dining hut which has good natural ambience. Now the BAD Points : ROOMS : the Deluxe Rooms are very Bad. They are too small and the bathrooms are even smaller. The family rooms are bigger in size but in all the Rooms, no VENTILATION. We go",AnandVaid,/Profile/AnandVaid,"New Delhi, India",30

You can do just three things here - eat,sleep and go for walks. After the first day you realize its not such a bad thing at all. Though the owners can definitely try and do something about the room interiors,  you stop minding once you have had a meal and taken a long nap.

The location is remote, there is practically no approach road that is a narrow path of about 100 Mtr  which requires a highly skilled driver to reach safely. The room was of good size, the Furnitures primitive and uncomfortable. The bath room was specious but no shower provided. Room service is only for morning & evening tea/ coffee etc.Meals are served at dining hall, to reach there you have to climb up&down 14 big steps three times a day, difficult for senior citizens. Service is by untrained boys but it is excellent. The behaviour of all the staff members was very good. The food was of good standard and quantity.

However, I was glad we chose this resort over all others, simply because this is the closest you can get to feeling like you are living in a home away from home. With your own privacy and space being on top priority when it comes to Fairydale’s hospitality, the resort that clocks a hundred years this year, offers peace, tranquillity and fresh air, alien to the urban dweller caught in the daily humdrum of a hectic life.

The drive from Delhi to Lansdowne - excepting the stretch from Delhi to Meerut, is quaint and scenic. The resort - plusses are home cooked meals, location - very near to Bhulla lake and the town center, and the calmness, serenity that comes of staying in a heritage property.

The staff is courteous and honest and comply with meal requests, especially catering to different tastes. Being a house which was built in 1912, it is bound to show some signs of aging, but this is well taken care of and it looks majestic from the outside.

About Lansdowne, everything is available on the net, so search for it.. About Fairydale, its the best in proper Lansdonwe.

We stayed in a duplex room which was actually a decent double bedroom with a small attic. It was a fairly large room with the only problem being no TV connection in the attic.

There is a narrow downslide branching from the road (unfortunately, there are no signboards at the branch point. We had to pass by it 2 times to finally reach the resort).

But who wants it anyway, when you can sit in a glasshouse style cafee, eating while watching the fireflies or listening to crickets, or just enjoying the pitch darkness outside.
