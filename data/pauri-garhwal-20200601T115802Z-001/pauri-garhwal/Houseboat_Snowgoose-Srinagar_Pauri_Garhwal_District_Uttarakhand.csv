pauri-garhwal,"Javeid bhai, the owner of this houseboat is the nicest person you'll come across. He made sure we had a great time in Srinagar. The houseboat is located in a peaceful setting and is also connected to the mainland, so you don't always have to take a Shikara to go to the mainland which is a big advantage, the home cooked food was simply brilliant and very reasonably priced. He was also a terrific guide and made sure we weren't over charged at other places. He will take care of everything from the beginning till the end, from arranging a tour car or a Shikara at a very reasonable price. Everyone in my family, including my parents and my Grandma had an amazing time at his place. Thank you Javeid bhai for this amazing hospitality.",Chandramouli M,/Profile/chandramoulim2018,,50
