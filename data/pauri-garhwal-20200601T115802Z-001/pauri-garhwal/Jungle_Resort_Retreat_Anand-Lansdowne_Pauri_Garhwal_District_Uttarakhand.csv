pauri-garhwal,"This place is creepy and unsafe for kids and ladies. Extremely difficult and dangerous to reach. Care taker was on drugs. Some people complained about dirty washrooms and he refused to give them rooms, knowing that it's a 2 hour journey back to town through a dangerous and broken road.  Swimming pool was full of dirty water and mosquitoes, rooms were stinky and furniture had termites.  it was full of shady characters. As going back to Lansedowne was dangerous in the evening, we decided to leave the resort and spend the night in our car at a safe distance. Go only if you wish to hide from cops, do drugs and don't have problems living in a pigsty.   I wouldn't let my dog live in a place like this.",chris,/Profile/christravels12,,10
pauri-garhwal,"While return from Mana / Auli, we were at leisurely pace, and honestly wanted to stay one more night away from scorching heat waves of NCR. All known property options in main town were fully booked, called up this resort. Rooms were free, got the directions, its through the steep and narrow downhill road from market. the road further became narrower and final stretch of 2+ kms was really adventurous, new drivers would find difficult to navigate through first time.  Please stock yourselves with necessary items from market, you may not want to take ride back to market just for that later.  The resort is amidst dense pine forest. Rooms are ok, average cleanliness, linen requires better care and quality. Food was good. Rooms spacious. Service is good. A few rides and 2 swimming",kcpdelhi,/Profile/kcpdelhi,"New Delhi, India",30

Tracking across jungle path is refreshing!Day temperature was around 26-27 but sitting under pine trees was amazing. Night temperature dipped to 9....resort arranged Bone fire, WOW!

First it's too risky to reach there as there is no road on hill. At a time only one car can go from this way and speed should be not more than 10 otherwise you vehicle can go in deep valley. It's a budget hotel you can say one star not a resort.....it's better that you can do camping there. They have two big pools but not have adequate staffing to maintain.

The gyser was not working in ours as well as the television. I did not expect a lot however as per the night charges the rooms were pretty expensive. Swimming pool had insects in them and i did not think the water was swimmable but people were swimming in it. The breakfast was good delicious however tea and dinner were pretty ordinary.

The detour to this resort is not for the faint hearted. Drive is on un-kept roads after reaching the town and I believe would be undrivable during rains. The resort itself is nice as it's completely cutoff from everything. Food was okay and as going to the town for every meal is not an option one can't do anything about it. The place could get loud at weekends as many corporate tour come for vacations and it defeats the purpose of choosing this place.

The person we spoke to, one Mr. Harinder, asked us to finalise again in the evening, so we called Friday night and he confirmed that there would be 4 rooms reserved for us.We reached Landsdowne at 1:00pm (we were driving down from Delhi) and we called the resort for directions from the main market at Gandhi Chowk. Imagine our consternation when the person at the desk said the rooms hadn't been kept for us. His excuse was ""people don't land up after confirming, so we just give the rooms on a first-come basis"". !!! What was the point of confirming, then?

We were told that we have very limited option to stay at lansdowne as lansdowne is very small town. We started searching hotels on internet and found jungle resort. We called them and booked 6 cottages for us. Later we went through the reviews on many travel website and realized that most the review were bad about this resort. Since we transfered 20% booking amount so we had no option.  We started at 11 AM from Noida in 3 cars and reached lansdowne at 7 PM.Roads till lansdowne town were ok. This resort was 3 KM. away from Gandhi chowk and road upto this resort was not good since there was no light on the road and road condition was also not good.

Our trip was planned at midnight and we started off.As landsdowne has a high footfall during weekend all resorts & hotels were in a sold out condition. However came across this place and had blocked a family room over the phone.  1. The approach of this place might be little confusing as it is away from the city ,downhill 3 kms from the main market.  2. The rooms are quite spacious but needs an maintenance very badly.  3. Hotel Staff are little reluctant in services however you will get everything that you need.  4. The amount that they charge i.e INR 3000/- for a family room should have better linens and neatness.

The property was good with large area for parking and the cottages was very good. their were 2 swimming pools and the playing area for children was very much. it was a kind of resort with excellent facilities but the main concern was the mosqitos in the cottages. They were large in no. and as soon as one switches on light in the evening the no. used to increase.apart from this there was not much concern for 2 days I spent with my friends.  hope they might have changed a lot till now, if not then they need to look at these basic facilities.",lyfiscool,/Profile/lyfiscool,"New Delhi, India",30

However, it was almost dangerous in the rainy season with landslides happening around. So, this resort should completely be avoided in rainy season. I'd say, avoid it ven when it is not raining as the infrastructure really sucks.  The rooms were huge but very poorly maintained and with lizards and mosquitoes. There was no hot water which is really essential in such hill stations.  The only positive i can remember is the natural beauty around the place and also the home-cooked style meal we had in the night.",vivekharshna,/Profile/vivekharshna,"Singapore, Singapore",20

But take my word for this it’s a great place for bachelor party (u can bring all your pleasures with u except family here). And please don’t think that u can go there just to inspect the place. Once u reach on the road to this Jungle resort u will get the wisdom that turning back is no more a wise option because if u will try to do so u can end up going back to your respected Gods. And once u reach this place u will feel that u lack the courage of going back and u need time to regain the strength and courage to go back and hit the road. And this is when u decide to stay there.

After reaching the main circle its a steep down drive with sharp turns with shops and people around, but that was just a beginning. It was a rainy season and experienced many landslide areas but nothing was worse than the road ahead. The 2 km drive was the worst, road was narrow and steep down.
