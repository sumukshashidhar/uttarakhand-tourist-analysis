Location is good but GMVN is doing fraud by offering these huts for booking. You can suggest this huts to your enemy for taking revenge. Not even worth paying Rs 200 for these tortureous stay.

In that cold night it was my survival instinct that caused me to use the quilt.

Prefer this place anytime to other hotels at Gandhi chowk that are located in noisy environment. Also, the food is nice and can be customised as per your need. Just let the cook there know what and how you want your meal. Would like to specially thanks Mr. Anup Anthwal who is the manager there.

Can view the Sunset by walking 500mtr or watch the sunrise from tip-n-top or from your room.  Service is not bad but tricky. If you tell them upfront what kind of food you like and what all you like they will serve. In my case they even bought something from the market. The trick is to tell them upfront. That's why we didn't liked the food first day but when we told them how we like they have prepared it same way and it was good.

pauri-garhwal,This rest house has everything going for it except the upkeep. The rooms are spacious and have basic amenities including hot water and clean linen. Cleanliness needs to improve and food options are very limited. Good value for money.,ADS,/Profile/wanderdas,,30
pauri-garhwal,"The rest-house was located within walking distance from the main market, the rooms were well ventilated, spacious and surrounded by greenery. All the places of tourist interests were also located within walking distance from the rest-house. We were a group of 4 and stayed at 2 economy grade rooms which was a value for money; however the wash room as well as the furniture in the room were a bit dirty. We did not eat in the hotel as there were timings for which we were not able to adhere to. However just 10 mins down to the market, is the Tipsy café, which served delicious steamy meals at very reasonable rates. We had all our meals at this café for the entire duration of our stay.

pauri-garhwal,"The location of the resthouse is good that it is in walking distance to all sites, the staff is nice and helpful, food is also fine, rooms are spacious and clean but the furniture/infrastructure is not maintained and hence the feeling of a government resthouse is there, be it the chairs in the garden or the garden itself, no care is being taken off. These things could be improved so that a perfect location and good food can be really enjoyed.Hope officials do listen and act before the place go in shambles. Cost wise the place is fine but I think a little maintenance would really help the place.",m0hit123,/Profile/m0hit123,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30

pauri-garhwal,"We planned to drive down to Lansdowne from Delhi, but dropped the plan after knowing the road condition from Delhi to Kotdwar. We took a train to Kotdwar and from there you get many options. We took a shared Sumo. Lansdowne is around 35 KM from Kotdwar and the hotel is approx 1.5 KM from the taxi stand. We had booked a family room (accommodates 4). We found the room size double than expected. We went in April end and was amused to find that the room did not have a fan or AC instead had blankets. After spending half an hour there we realized why it is so ;). The room lacked proper cleaning, and had issues with plumbing. Only one bathroom had a working Geyser out of the two. Toilets were not clean as desired and fittings were not repaired. It was better to not to use the cupboards",DKD,/Profile/Bihadi,"Downingtown, Pennsylvania",30
pauri-garhwal,"We had been planning to go for a ""weekend + long drive"" holiday and zeroed in on Lansdowne after some deliberation. We decided upon the GMVNL Tourist Rest House (TRH) on a whim. I have to say it was the perfect choice. The TRH is located just a little out of the town square (and Lansdowne is tiny) yet is just a comfortable walk away. We personally checked out some other hotels and found them to be too expensive.  We took a basic twin accommodation room. There is adequate parking in front and a lovely ""terrace garden"" at the back. This is where we chose to have breakfast and lunch. Of course dinner was in the Dining Hall as it would get chilly. The room was spacious and hot water was available. Linen was clean and there were no strange odours anywhere in the room.
