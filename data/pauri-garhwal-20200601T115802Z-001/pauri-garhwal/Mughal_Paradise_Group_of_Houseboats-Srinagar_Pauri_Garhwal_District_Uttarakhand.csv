pauri-garhwal,booked 5 rooms for 3 nights and have a memorising stay in Mughal Paradise Houseboats. good clean houseboat with center location. easy to reach market. rooms are well furnished and spacious as same as pictures. our another friends group stayed in standard houseboats of Mughal Paradise and we stay in deluxe boats of Mughal paradise. there is little bit difference in standard and deluxe boats like room size and interior. but deluxxe boats are excellent. staff was cooperative and helpful. my stay there was memorising. In Srinagar hotels rooms are not so big in size so we decide to go in houseboats they have all modern amenities and approx room size was 14X14 including extra bed.owner was humble and helpful. we definately come back in summers with big group of 80 paxes approx.,forthempire4u,/Profile/forthempire4u,"New Delhi, India",50

Food in houseboat was tasty and hygienic. One small issue is hot water comes late rest all are good. Service was good and on time. Hotel in pahalgam was not good enough and gulmarg hotel was average some members of our family was not happy to stay in pahalgam but houseboat stay makes our trip fantastic and memorable. Mughal paradise group is recommended to all. Once again thanks to all team.,Prakash V,/Profile/vermaprakash085,"Pune, India",50
