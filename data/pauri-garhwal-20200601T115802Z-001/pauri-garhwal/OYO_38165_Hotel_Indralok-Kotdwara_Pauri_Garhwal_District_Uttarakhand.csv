pauri-garhwal,"I had been to Hotel Indralok last weekend and was totally disappointed with my stay. I opted for an A/C room. The bathroom taps were broken and leaking. There was no hot water. The money they charged was more than a regular budget hotel in a small town. Indralok was also understaffed. Service was not prompt. Towel and soap was provided to me only when I insisted for it. The stairs were steep and unsafe without any hand railing. So overall, I was left with a bad experience. Central location was the only plus point which I can recall.",Veejo_Mumbai,/Profile/Veejo_Mumbai,"Bengaluru, India",20
pauri-garhwal,"Rooms are dirty, not managed, gyser was not working. Room services was also not upto the mark. Main door lock and bathroom door was not lockable.  Location of hotel is at main Devi road. No lift and internet available.  Airconditioners were ok ok..dish connectivity was ok ok.  If u do not have any choice of stay at Kotdwar..then u can select this hotel to stay.  ",madhuvarsha,/Profile/madhuvarsha,"New Delhi, India",10
