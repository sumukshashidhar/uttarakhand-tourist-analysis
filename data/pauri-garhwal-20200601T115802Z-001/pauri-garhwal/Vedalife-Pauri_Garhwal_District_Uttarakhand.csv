pauri-garhwal,I recently stayed st Vedalife for a week long meditation retreat with about 25 people. I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better stay. I was really able to switch off and be present.   The 360 views of the mountains are stunning. Lovely clean and spacious rooms. Great Indian buffet style food with plenty of variety. And the most lovely and accommodating staff you could hope for. They were so eager to please and really made our stay.  Tip: You need your own wifi and depending on your provider it is likely to be patchy at best. But if you‚Äôre planning to stay for retreat that‚Äôs a good thing in my opinion. :),Kate M,/Profile/Keito11,"Melbourne, Australia",50
