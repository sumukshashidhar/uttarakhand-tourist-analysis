pauri-garhwal,"I have been travelling in the mountains of Kumaon and Garhwal for over thirty years. During those travels I had almost always stayed in the state operated Tourist Rest Houses known as Tourist Reception Centers (TRC) .   I had passed through Gairsain quite frequently in the past.It was a sleepy little  nondescript  township before Uttarakhand was carved out of the State of Uttar Pradesh. Today it happens to be the proposed future permanent capital of Uttarakhand  with  Uttarakhand  Legislative Assembly at Bhararisain , a picturesque location 14 kilometers from Gairsain.  There was no TRC in Gairsain for several years but when Uttarakhand came in to being  it finally saw a TRC  operated by the Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam .   I have since stayed there and had not found it any",tjjohn,/Profile/tjjohn,"Meerut, India",50

pauri-garhwal,"Gaisain GMVN is located 49 kms from Karnprayag on Ranikhet/ Dwarahat / Adibadrinath Road. Its 175 kms from Badrinath. One of the best managed properties of GMVN. The building is new with two floors. Rooms are big and very well maintained. Stayed here with parents for one night on the way to Dunagiri Temple from Badrinath. Nice garden, amazing service and awesome food. Its just 20 kms from historical Adi Badrinath Temple. Very strongly recommended.",Kaustubh J,/Profile/60kaustubhj,"Zug, Switzerland",40
