pauri-garhwal,"We stayed for 3 days at Hotel Devlok during our visit to Uttarakhand.The hospitality and service of staff was very good. The breakfast offered was very nice. Above all, the management made very attempt to make us feel like a guest and not a customer. Location of the property is extremely good with a green mountain view and a nice garden around. Rooms are adorned with beautiful paintings and are very cozy and clean. This is the kind of place I look for after a hectic travel.",mansi s,/Profile/965mansis,"Mumbai, India",40
pauri-garhwal,"During our trip to Garhwal Himalayas we stayed at Hotel Devlok for a week in Srinagar Garhwal. Rooms have rich ambience and very clean and comfortable. The staff is well behaved and food is too good.The whole hotel campus has been beautifully maintained. Mr. A.S. Aswal, the owner of the hotel helped us plan our itinerary and suggested several ‘must visit’ places in Garhwal like Dharidevi temple, Kilkileshwar, Tehri Dam, Devprayag, Valley of flowers, etc. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay  at the hotel. Only hotel in Srinagar Garhwal to add value to your money.",Maverick0210,/Profile/Maverick0210,Bengaluru,50
pauri-garhwal,We stayed at Hotel Devlok while going to badrinath and kedarnath. The staff was very courteous and friendly. The hotel is spread over a huge area surrounded with gardens so our kids didnt find any problem in playing around. Food is good and the rooms give a luxurious feel which is rare in hill stations. The best part which we liked about the hotel is the architecture. It gives more of a resort kind of feeling where you can roam around for a walk near the gardens and not just be restricted to your room only.,coolblue16,/Profile/coolblue16,"Chennai, India",50
pauri-garhwal,"We stayed at this place while returning from Badrinath. This is a budget hotel and provides value-for-money. Srinagar (Pauri Garhwal) gets very crowded during Badrinath / Hemkund Sahib Yatra season and this Hotel provides decent accommodation at reasonable rates.  Location: This Hotel is located at the end of Srinagar town (Pauri Garhwal). So while coming back from Badrinath, it comes before one enters the busy town area. Though Srinagar is not a big town, the location implies that one cannot walk down to the famed Kamleshwar Mahadev temple or to the river bed accessible from the middle of the town. However the good thing about this location is that it is quiet and peaceful. We could also hear noise of water - mostly it was of the Alaknanda river flowing.  Food: We took in-room",Yogesh,/Profile/Japakusum,"Maheshwar, India",40
