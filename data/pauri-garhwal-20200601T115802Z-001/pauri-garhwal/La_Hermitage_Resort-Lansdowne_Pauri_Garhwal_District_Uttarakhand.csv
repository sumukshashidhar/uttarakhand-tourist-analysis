pauri-garhwal,We visited for 3 days and loved the calmness and closeness to nature. Away from the hustle of the town / daily routine it offers perfect setting to rejuvenate your self.   We had a great time with children. They also spend some good time away from the gadgets and tv exploring nature / birds / trekking/ sounds of the river/ mountain village.  A prefect getaway,Sanket,/Profile/Skheria,,40

pauri-garhwal,"La Hermitage Resort is a beautiful property not very far (~ 8-9 kms) from Vatanvasa Gate of Kalagarh Tiger Reserve (Corbett) which is the area lesser explored. We were very comfortable during our 3N stay there - the food cooked was very tasty & homely and staff took extra efforts in giving us what we wanted with timely service. Room service was also good. The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. Very good value for money.

pauri-garhwal,"So, Me and my husband did a lot of research before booking and we were glad once we reached the resort. The resort itself gives you mix and match of everything you need from a hectic city life. The ride from the pick point to the resort is not even adventurous but also you get to see how skillful the drivers are to drive on such routes. The Staff and Rajendar(Manager) is one of the best people we have met ever..They help and guide you not because its part of their job but they actually would put an effort for you to experience the best of Hills, Forest and Rivers around.  MY MAIN REASON for writing this review is because of the manager who arranged car fuel for us as we were kind off short on that and trust me arranging that for us was not a easy task because of the routes.

pauri-garhwal,"Location: The resort is located near Kalagarh Tiger Reserve and is quite far from Lansdowne Cantt. It is perched on top of a hill. If solitude is what you are looking for, this is a great place to stay. If you want to explore ‚ÄòLansdowne‚Äô as we know it, this is not the place for you. I was looking for the former and this place didn‚Äôt disappoint.  Rooms: The rooms are spacious. There is always the possibility of insects crawling up your bed in hill resorts and we found a scorpion in the bathroom! Nevertheless the rooms were well maintained with 24x7 power and water supply.   The resort: It is located on top of a hill and the journey from the parking up to the resort is an adventure in itself.

pauri-garhwal,"The setting of LaHermitage resort is very nice! It is literally on the edge of a jungle (Beni forest - part of Corbett) which is both a pro or con for the property.   You can enjoy extremely peaceful stay, river/ village walk, services of very nice staff at the resort. But beware it is a lonely place with a real threat of wild animals especially in evening. In fact the resort is in a place Silwar which is over 50 KMs away from main place Lansdowne (a let down for us when we found out after we reached).   Resort is at top of a hill and access to main road is a challenge even if you have your own vehicle. Resort will pick guests from a parking area at foot of hill and for every small or big need guest will have to request for a drop off at parking area which btw is 3 -4 kms away",sumitch0pra,/Profile/sumitch0pra,"New Delhi, India",30

This place is completely disconnected from any shop/ amenities that may be needed.   don't expect the services to be good as you may keep calling them and they would not listen, though the staff is courteous.  The rooms stink because of the bad maintenance of the toilet.

Instead, you get out of the car, climb the steps and enter the room. On the phone it was confirmed that there is a balcony in the room but we arrived to discover it was a lie.
