pauri-garhwal,"Kotdwara is a small place and though some hill stations are nearby not many tourists come here. By those standards this hotel is good. The rooms are very nice with cottage style rooms, spacious bathroom and enough lights. The view from the hotel is also nice, giving a sneak peak of the Himalayas that a traveler is going to encounter if he is going further into the Himalayas.   However, there are not many facilities as the hotel is short on staff. There are not many dishes that they serve and they take a lot of time to serve those. So be advised.",PankajSaxena,/Profile/PankajSaxena,"Gwalior, India",40
