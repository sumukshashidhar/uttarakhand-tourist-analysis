pauri-garhwal,"Although we did not stay at this property I feel it can be a useful resource in summer days if you happen to know this place. This is a small place with just 9 rooms on each floor but its location in Deriyakhal is very good, just on the road side and before the toll barrier. It is very close to Blue Pine and Green Palms hotels. The ground floor is reserved for restaurant. There is in-house kitchen and restaurant doubles as dining area. Rooms are properly furnished and face the road; however the balcony is very narrow. Parking is like any other hotel in Lansdowne, on the roadside. Care-taker Mr. Choudhary is an interesting person to interact with.",WanderingSAM555,/Profile/WanderingSAM555,"Bareilly, India",40
