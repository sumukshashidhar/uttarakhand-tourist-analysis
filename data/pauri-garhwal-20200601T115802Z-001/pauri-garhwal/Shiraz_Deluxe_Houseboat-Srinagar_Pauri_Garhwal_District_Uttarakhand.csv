pauri-garhwal,"We had a memorable experience here. Our houseboat attendant was too much conscious about us. We cooked, we did almost everything possible here. It's a life time experience. Every tourist should stay here once. Wonderful view from every corner. Luxurious stay with antique furniture and fixture.",arijitds34,/Profile/arijitds34,"Kolkata, India",50
pauri-garhwal,Although we stayed there for just one night but i feel we should have prolonged our stay as it was so aesthetic and beautiful that one would want to stay for a longer time. The people were so nice an caring that you would always think of going there again and again.,RajaRathor,/Profile/RajaRathor,"Pune, India",50

pauri-garhwal,"Me and my husband had put up a very hastily planned trip to Kashmir, results being obvious, we were ending up with little information and sometimes with disastrous results, Mr Javid  of Shiraz  Houseboat, was a sudden find, on a day of frantic searching for houseboats while on the way to Pahalgam. He is very well recommended in TripAdvisor and deservedly so, as he has managed to uphold consistent standards, and its his personal value system which reflects in the spirit of the people and the place he manages. We had a really nice time at the Shiraz Houseboats and would like to highly recommend him, because Kashmir has too many options, and too many tourists its difficult to find people like him, he simplifies with integrity, as he would say Insallah hope to visit again soon",Monu C,/Profile/monuc777,"Rishikesh, India",50
pauri-garhwal,"i stayed for four nights alone on my trip to kashmir, houseboat owner Shabroz Sheikh bhai helped me a lot, he guided me where to go and what to do, I was arrived at ghat no 07 at 11:pm and Shabroz Sheikh bhai came himself to pick me fro ghat no 07, the houseboat is well maintained and arrenged by it is very closed to meena bazaar(floating market), food was awesome like home made food, i feel very safe and comfortable at hb golden crest  Room Tip: Choose Deluxe class",ajaykumarmumbai3,/Profile/ajaykumarmumbai3,"Mumbai, India",50
