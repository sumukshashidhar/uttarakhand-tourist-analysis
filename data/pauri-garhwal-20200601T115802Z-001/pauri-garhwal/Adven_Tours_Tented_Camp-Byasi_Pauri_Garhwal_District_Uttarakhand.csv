pauri-garhwal,"Me and my other four friends arrived in rishikesh and found that all those famous camping areas were fully occupied. We were hopeless and didn't know what else to do. Then with the help of one of our friends, we got the location of this camp. We didn't have any hope but to our surprise, it was  a mind blowing resort to stay in. Its completely isolated from those busy and noisy area and situated in the middle of a completely peaceful and serene area. Nothing can beat its location. Situated just near the Ganga river and having the white sand, it will give you a beach kind of atmosphere.  Also the staff was very cooperative. They never hesitated to bring anything which we wanted from the market. Ultimately is was just unforgettable experience.",karthikmvs,/Profile/karthikmvs,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",50
pauri-garhwal,We went river rafting for the first time with Adven Tour. They have camp next to the river ganges where we stayed. In the evening the organised camp fire which was nice as we had gone there during early winter month. The guide who took us for rafting had good knowledge and was an expert. He really made our day!  We loved rafting with Adven tours so much that we went again and they were eager as always to ensure that our stay was a comfortable one. If you love adventure sports the go with Adven tours...,BobbyMehta,/Profile/BobbyMehta,"Mumbai, India",40
