pauri-garhwal,"The rooms are well maintained, hot water, tv connection, good house keeping, professionally trained room/bell boys.  Local food in breakfast, great menu in Lunch / Dinner Buffets.  Dreamy placement of the hotel, mountains, flowing river, clouds etc are a perfect outing for complete unwinding from a city life.Excellent place to stay with good food and ambience. The rooms and other facilities are nicely maintained. The riverside open area is amzing during evening. Mornings are quite pleasant due to Ganga river",Sakshi U,/Profile/SakshiU14,,50
