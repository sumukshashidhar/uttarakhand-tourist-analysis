pauri-garhwal,This hotel is right next to the Gumkhal market in Uttarakhand. We had to make an unscheduled stop overnight due to torrential rains and this hotel is the most accessible in the area. The rooms are strictly functional but the valley view is beautiful and you can get mesmerized by the clouds floating by. The food and service are better than average.,zazen_mumbai,/Profile/zazen_mumbai,"Mumbai, India",40
pauri-garhwal,The location of the hotel is very good.  Located in Gumkhal 12 kms from lansdowne. Over all its a very quiet place.  The rooms are spacious and the common balcony offer amazing views of the valley.  The rooms amenities are very basic and overall cleanliness is very good. The hotel staff is very helpful. Food is tasty and everytime they cook fresh food on order basis.  You can also request them to cook any of your fav dish on demand.  they also arrange for bonfire.  If you are looking to stay at a budget place with decent amenities and  cleanliness away from the crowds of hte maintown (and with amazing views) then this is d rigth place. DOnot miss Tarakeshwar Mahadevtemple (50 kms from this hotel) and Bhairav Garhi (6kms) when you are in Gumkhal or Lansdowne.,varun b,/Profile/varunb443,,50
pauri-garhwal,"One of the few budget accommodations available in the Lansdowne area, and probably the better one among those. It is located 12 kms away from main Lansdowne, in the village of Gumkhaal. There are two categories of available rooms, with the superior category rooms being 4 in number and on the 2nd floor, which is the top floor of the property. The superior rooms are about 64 sq ft, and open into a deck which provides an unhindered view of the valley, the hills and the forests. The attached toilets are clean. The cable tv has all the popular english channels. Food served is decent. The young boy who manages the place is quick and courteous.",Vijay Badhani,/Profile/vijaybadhani,"New Delhi, India",30
