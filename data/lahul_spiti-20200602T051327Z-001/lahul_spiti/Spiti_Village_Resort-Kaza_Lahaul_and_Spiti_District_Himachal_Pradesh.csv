My wish list is NOW-to have a house there. No no-i think ill settle for frequent visits to this resort. Virgin territory, no hustle bustle. No pahar ganj. Its still Golflinks at its best. A pleasing to the eye Mud resort,so soothing, smells like bahist(heaven again). The landscape during the day is a virtual feast for the eyes and during the night a virtual feast for the senses. One feels so close to the Almighty. The Dry moutains reminded me of the Nubra valley albeit that was a poor country cousin to this vast expanse. One can be lucky to spot some wild life in the open. The calming Buddhist culture is such a soothing experience.",soodvipin,/Profile/soodvipin,"Nagpur, India",50
