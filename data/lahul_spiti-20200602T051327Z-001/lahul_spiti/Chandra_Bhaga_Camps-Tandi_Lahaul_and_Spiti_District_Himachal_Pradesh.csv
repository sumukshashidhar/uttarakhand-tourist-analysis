lahul_spiti,Vikram is one of the best hosts I've come across. He makes sure you have everything necessary to help you feel comfortable. We went around the village on walks and even visited the nearby monasteries together. The location is just ideal with the Chandra and Bhaga rivers confluence located just in front of you. Brilliant place!,Avantika C,/Profile/AvantikaC11,,50
lahul_spiti,"Chandra Bhaga Camps hosted by Vicky Bhaiya and his family is located right at the confluence of Chandra and Bhaga rivers in Lahaul with amazing hospitality, & homemade,organic food cooked by AuntyðŸ˜Š. You don't need to go anywhere else in Lahaul if you visit here, just sit at the camp, gaze the mighty Himalayas all around and watch how the mountains changes colours from day through night. It's breathtaking to say the least. Vicky bhaiya and his family are well aware of the local places to visit and will guide you to have a memorable experience in Lahaul. The people of Lahaul are extremely helpful and warm, visit this quaint valley to get mesmerized. ",Sanmitra M,/Profile/sanmitram2017,"Mumbai, India",50
