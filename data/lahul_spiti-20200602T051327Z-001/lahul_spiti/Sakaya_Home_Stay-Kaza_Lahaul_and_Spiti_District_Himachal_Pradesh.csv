lahul_spiti,Being in the hospitality field I can proudly say that this is an amazing place where the guest are welcome as family members. The owner Mr. Tshering is an amazing person with endless knowledge. We were so glad that you accommodated is for one night without any booking and ensure we had a lovely stay next day also. Your team is superb and made sure that we friends had a lovely stay in your Homestay. The food was so good and the service was top notch. Small details such as heated electric blanket is truly bliss in extreme winter season. Thanks you so much and definitely will be back to same place whenever I come to Kaza. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place and you wonâ€™t regret it.,Rohit J,/Profile/rohitj104,Maldives,50
lahul_spiti,"Sakya Homestay Kaza I stayed at Sakya Homestay along with my friends in July. The family it belonged to was wonderful. Very sweet and gentle people. Always willing to help you and please you. The house is really warm, beautifully arranged with great interiors. The food was great and cooked with care. All in all a very comfortable stay. Would love to return here.",Rijuta T,/Profile/rijutat2016,"Pondicherry, India",40
lahul_spiti,"Good, clean, well furnished rooms. We had two ensuite bedrooms on the first floor with one living room  attached to them. Meals are served on the ground floor in a dining room, spiti style, so sitting on the floor with low tables. Our kids (5 and 10) played a lot with 8 year old Karma Yursu (not sure of spelling!) as it was a weekend. Very good food, you can have a choice of dishes if you discuss with the cook a few hours before. Friendly, welcoming family. The best homestay out of the 5 we stayed at during our Spiti Valley trip",Eveline G,/Profile/EvelineG_13,"Dar es Salaam, Tanzania",50
lahul_spiti,we had a wonderful stay here for two days in march 2019. food is excellent and is very well equipped with everything that is needed for a winter sub zero temperature stay. Tschering  the owner is an amazing guy to interact with and learn about spiti and all thet one can do there. Ravi and Nandu are real assets in running this place. Didi who is in charge of the kitchen makes absolutely delicious food. if u happen to visit kaza and spiti please check this place out. you will not be disappointed.,Ulhas D,/Profile/ulhasd2016,"Mumbai, India",50
lahul_spiti,"When we visited Spiti second time, we knew this is going to be a different experience as it was a winter drive. It was an unplanned drive so we were mentally ready to face the challenges. While leaving from Kalpa towards Spiti, I just thought of enquiring regarding possibility of stay arrangements with Mr. Tsering of Sakya Abode. As expected the hotels had not opened and Mr. Tsering had been out of town. I requested him if staying arrangements can be made at his home stay and was glad he agreed. I knew its going to be a very interesting stay and association.  It was actually a home away from home and we felt we have been staying at our close relative's place. The room was kept neat n clean even during the hard winters there. Heater was kept before we arrived and we need not ask",Sarita_Athawale,/Profile/Sarita_Athawale,Pune,50
lahul_spiti,"Ok, so when we booked his place, we thought we were booking ourselves at the Sakya Abode hotel but the booking confirmation read home stay which we never imagined would be something different. On being turned away from the hotel, we were a bit disappointed but when we arrived into the hospitality of Mr. Sering and his wonderful family, we were delighted. This home stay with ""2 rooms and a living room"" forming a home setting along with a kitched, dining area and drawing room is superb. It is well furnished but what will steal your heart is the family's hospitality. You can use the kitchen if you like to cook but you would not want to as what the staff cooks is awesome. Such is the hospitality that when the cook realized while serving us breakfast that the other guests were",ms14_delhi,/Profile/ms14_delhi,"Mumbai, India",50
lahul_spiti,Yes it is. This is the best place to stay in Kaza if one really wants to get the feel of Tibetan culture. Great food and great hospitality. WOnderful location. Decorated rooms with Tibetan artifacts. Soft spoken people. Very helping nature. I wish I could visit it again.,shreyas w,/Profile/180shreyasw,"Mumbai, India",50
