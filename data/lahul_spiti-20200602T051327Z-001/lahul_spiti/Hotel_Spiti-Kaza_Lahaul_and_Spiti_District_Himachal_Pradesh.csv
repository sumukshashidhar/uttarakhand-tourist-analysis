lahul_spiti,"I have visited this hotel during my Kaza Trip (August,2019). I have identified some pros and cons of this hotel.  Pros: Rooms are good and equipped with basic amenities. View from the rooms are great and specially from the common roof top area.  Rooms tariff includes food charges (Buffet Breakfast & Buffet Dinner - Veg). Food quality is very good and offers good variety. They provides non veg food also (on demand).  Reception service is good and responds as early as possible.  Room bathrooms are in good conditions and equipped with Geyser.  Parking area is large enough and petrol pump is situated in walking distance.  Hotel staffs are very helpful.  Cons: Number of Charging points are less and some of the existing points are not working properly.  It was an awesome experience.",Sugata Pal,/Profile/Sugata2904,"Kolkata, India",50
lahul_spiti,"We stayed for 3 nights in this hotel and the experience was truly exceptional except on the last day when water stopped and we got a bit late for our start. The service was amazing everywhere, in rooms, bell desk, front desk, at the restaurant, etc. Just one observation for housekeeping would be to not arrange and keep all of the luggage in the racks when we are out because that muxes up the luggage of 3 different people in a room and it gets difficult after a long day to find our belongings from all the arranged things. The breakfast on all days was tasty and the rooms were peaceful so we were able to have a nice sleep on all nights. It also has a huge parking so we never had a problem in parking our motorcycles together. ",Murtaza A,/Profile/MurtazaA130,,40
lahul_spiti,We stayed here for 2 nights during our visit to Kaza. The rooms are not well maintained but the services of the hotel staffs are really good. The food was really good in taste.

lahul_spiti,Nice hotel in the middle of the desert. Well done hptdc .we went to kaza from manali via Chandra tal. Road condition is horrible but that is understandable as this place is covered by snow for six months. Hectic journey but comfortable stay. They give complimentary breakfast and dinner but veg ,Passenger791667,/Profile/Passenger791667,"Kolkata, India",40

lahul_spiti,"We were trying to get accommodation in ""Deyzor"" basis the reviews, however since it was full we ventured to  select this hotel. The hotel and its rooms are neat and clean but need maintenance (being a govt. run hotel). We booked 3 rooms 204 - 206 on the first floor. The staff was good. The food was average and quality could have been better  at that price. We only took meals in the hotel on the first day of stay, nex day we had out meals at ""Deyzor"" (Amazing food at an unbelievable price at such a remote location). Bathrooms were neat and clean (there was no electricity for more than a couple of hours hence no hot water). The rooms offer great views of the surrounding mountains and the Spiti river. Its at a 15 minute walk from the main market / Spiti monastery). Overall a good",Prasanjeet M,/Profile/prasanjeetm2016,"New Delhi, India",40
lahul_spiti,"Apart from that food was nice,staffs were polite,not value for money Rooms were smelly. If you'd like to stay for a night it would be a good decision, don't stay more than a night city centre is very far from the hotel",Rashmi C,/Profile/RashmiC155,,30
lahul_spiti,The hotel is not luxurious but nobody visits this place for luxury.. The surrounding are so breathtaking you'll forget everything else.. Night sky is so starry you can never forget It..There is no best time to visit this place.. Take at least 7days explore and experience Spiti.. I had an awesome stay in this hotel..,Akash S,/Profile/945akashs,,50
lahul_spiti,Hotel spiti was great choice while staying at Kaza. Great comfort with delicious 3/4 course dinner served near room. Hot cozy rooms with great scenic beauty around. Mountains really speak about nature. Awesome experience. ,nehaamit81,/Profile/nehaamit81,,50
lahul_spiti,We stay there for 3 days. Hotel location is excellent. Hotel rooms are basic but cleaned. Amenities are good. Hotel manager and others stuffs are good and friendly. You can get veg and non veg food there.,sumana086,/Profile/sumana086,"Bengaluru, India",40
lahul_spiti,"Having looked at a few hotel options before traveling to Spiti Valley, we had wanted to stay either at ""The Deyzor"" or ""Sakya Abode"". Unfortunately rooms were not available at either of these two places & we had to settle for the HPTDC run,The Spiti. Quite unbelievable that in a place like Kaza, hotel rooms would get booked out in advance but then we did travel during th peak summer holidays.  You dont travel to a place like Kaza to enjoy the luxurious stay of a hotel. In that respect The Spiti does not disappoint - a clean & decent hotel to rest in.The rooms are very clean & basic with clean linen & huge geysors.  Bookings preferably to be done in advance - either online or through the helpline no. Food served at dinner is hot though veg only.

lahul_spiti,"From the moment one enters, the building is crying for renovation, especially if you want to call it a hotel. The doors, carpets, furniture, almirahs, tables, everything feels like it has seen its best days in the past.. Rooms are okay in size, but bathrooms are small.. like most mountain places, one can only find basic necessities only in the room. Food was a mix of good and very good (maybe different chef at different times). Very helpful staff, though very limited in numbers.. Location is great.. parking is abundant..  we did face the trouble of very dirty water (due to sand).. and the hotel could not do anything about it.. because of this we even tried to change the hotel, but could not find stay in the one we wanted..",Gaurav,/Profile/AggarwalG,"New Delhi, India",40
lahul_spiti,"For 5 days what we paid was very nominal and got breakfast and dinner included in our package. Overall the space is good and in Kaza, thus making it easy to move around and get to places.  Booking however needs to be done online and in advance as there is a high demand for hptdc accommodations.   The rooms are spacious but not cleaned regularly. Windows have been built such that it's difficult to enjoy the beauty with square frames all over. Food does not have much variety but they do have specific meals to offer which are fine.   Tea and coffee served is not too great as the milk in kaza is mostly powdered so does it have the taste. But coffee is better than tea.   Geysers work well but the size of the bathrooms is enough for two buckets and a person to stand. If you are into",RoyIshan,/Profile/RoyIshan,"New Delhi, India",30
lahul_spiti,Visited June 2016. Dilapidated Building crying out for renovation and maintenance. Only open for six months with staff coming from Manali. Limited food menu. Worst bathrooms ever seen with no plumbing dark dingy smelly. Staff is the only saving grace who are very sweet and try to give best service from meagre resources provided to them. Five star rating for staff and nothing for infrastructure. ,Rateesh S,/Profile/rateeshs,"Chandigarh, India",20
lahul_spiti,The hotel has good infrastructure with good spacious rooms with good view but less on maintenance. The hotel is under staffed and services are not that prompt. One man is there who serves as manager / restaurant waiter / on call service boy and what else! Food is within the package and quite standard to have at this location. Feel like it is bit overpriced.

lahul_spiti,"We travelled to Kinnaur & Spiti in early-June 2015 and stayed at this hotel in Kaza for 2 nights. The hotel was in a nice location, with rooms overlooking the Spiti river. Unfortunately, we arrived only 1 day after the hotel had opened for the season and it was still running with minimum facilities. The rooms were not fully ready and we did not have electricity for a few hours on the 1st day. Conditions improved on the 2nd day though and I think it would be a pretty decent hotel when fully operational. The restaurant was good and the staff were polite and courteous.",Arindam C,/Profile/671arindamc,"Kolkata, India",30
lahul_spiti,As in all other places in Himachal the USP of this HPTDC property is also its fantastic location. Literally an abode just in the lap of the mighty mountains.

lahul_spiti,With all the modern facilities in the remote area. Hotel staff is very helpful. Food is good but menu is limited. Rooms are large and well maintained.Car parking available.

lahul_spiti,"I wonder why its referred to as ' Tourist Lodge' here, the hotel is known as ' The Spiti' in Kaza and that's what all signages leading up to the hotel and on the hotel block read. We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights while discovering Kaza and its surrounds on a recent road trip to Spiti. We were given a heads up on the hotel but the staff at Hotel Kinner Kailash at Kalpa. Since we had no reservations, we decided to check out other options on the way to the hotel. Amongst the ones available, we found this one to be the best option. It is located almost on the outskirts in Kaza in way to Manali and its rooms have an unobstructed view of the Spiti River (although strangely, the premium cottages within the property have no view of the river).

lahul_spiti,"Stayed in this govt. hotel from 1st october to 2nd october,2014. A good hotel in a very high altitude like Kaza. Rooms are big having basic facilities. Bathrooms are also ok with geyser though electricity problem makes it difficult to get hot water always. The behaviour of the hotel staff is very good and helpful. Food served is not up to the mark particularly for the bengali tourists. I recommend this hotel as a good place to stay in a remote area like Kaza.",201411pp,/Profile/201411pp,"Naihati, West Bengal, India",40
lahul_spiti,"We did online booking for this hotel and frankly was very skeptical about staying in this hotel. Hotel is nice, spacious and view from there marvellous. Being government property we can imagine that not highly maintained but staff and services very good. The tariff includes the Breakfast & dinner. Staff is vey hospitable. They will wait for you and serve the   hot food. Dinner very good. Location very good esp the view. Photo attached. Close to market.",Shadesbyanu,/Profile/Shadesbyanu,"New Delhi, India",30

lahul_spiti,"Terrible place to stay in, choose only if you have no other option.  We arrived there dead tired after a hard day's ride through non-existent roads and the rooms had no hot water, nor did the beds have any linen on them.  The lobby is full of peeling paint and the whole place looks like a shabbily kept and neglected government office.  The floors haven't been cleaned for ages, and the ""restaurant"" was just a large room with dirty tables and surly staff.  As for 'food', the less said the better.
