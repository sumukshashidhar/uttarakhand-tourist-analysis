lahul_spiti,"Jispa is one of the beautiful place to stay when you plan a road trip from Manali to leh.  We reached around 7 pm in hotel, as Manali- leh highway., there are no street light so we were not able to see the location in night time, but only we felt some river is flowing near-by. In morning, when we went out we were amazed by the beauty of location, mountain- river-clouds and in between the Ibex hotel. Service provided by the staff was excellent. They packed breakfast for un on our request. Also dinner which they served was very tasty (esp Non-veg food) . I would like to visit this place again.",richa5791,/Profile/richa5791,,40

lahul_spiti,Stayed overnight here on the way to Leh from Manali.   Excellent location right on the road with the river in front but the upkeep can be better. My room was full of flies in both the room and the bathroom.  Did not escalate as all I wanted was a place to keep my head and grab some grub.  Both requirements were met completely.  Plus point was the running hot water which in early October was heavenly!  Would I consider an extended stay there - probably not.

Location - right on the Manali Leh highway and you dont need to take any diversions off the route. It would be visible from half a km away. The area opposite the hotel is a river bed and serves a great place to have a walk and do some photography. We spent around a couple of hours at the river bed.

The manager said he will arrange for some tented",Soumyajit N,/Profile/nandy_soumyajit,"Kolkata, India",20
lahul_spiti,"Measured by european standards this place does not even fulfil the standard of an average Alpine hut/shelter. It is cold, draughty, not clean, hard beds, electricity and water limited to a few moments. The food thogh was not bad - bad no choice either - you eat what you get (vegetarian, naturally.....). It is probably one of  a very few possibilities to make an overnight halt on the long way from Manali to Leh/ladakh.",Tancred180,/Profile/Tancred180,"Brussels, Belgium",20
lahul_spiti,"Hotel located on Highway,Panoramic view with wonderful river sound 24hrs,delicious food,No room service,no intercoms ,bathrooms require up gradation , LCD/TV location needs proper placing as they r located left/right side of bed which is awkward & uncomfortable.",PremThakur,/Profile/PremThakur,manali,30
lahul_spiti,We were to stay at Ibex Hotel but got stuck because of a landslide few kms before jispa. We reached the hotel in the morning and spent only about an hour there to freshen up before we continued journey to Manali. We were pleasantly surprised to find the rooms very clean and spacious with LCD TV sets even in such a remote area. The Hotel staff was very co-operative and they packed breakfast for us on our request.  The best part of the hotel was its location and view from the rooms which was beautiful. We really missed spending more time there.,MonicaMatani,/Profile/MonicaMatani,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",40
lahul_spiti,Location is awesome...food is decent and rooms are clean...all you can ask for in these difficult landscapes. Staff is very helpful and you can get good travel information from them. Overall a good place to get your breath back when travelling on manali leh road.,abhijeetsingh148,/Profile/abhijeetsingh148,Delhi,40
lahul_spiti,"The hotel is well-situated on the Leh-Manali highway and, although not at the half-way point, a good place to break the journey in either direction (there are not many other options). The rooms are clean and have hot and cold running water and electricity; the restaurant provides reasonable food morning and evening and the staff are friendly. It's not five star but after a long trek it felt like it!",travelbsuisse,/Profile/travelbsuisse,"Neuchâtel, Switzerland",30
lahul_spiti,We were two couples travelling in Ladakh in August 2012 and had booked a package with a tour operator. We took the road from Manali to Leh and this place was our first stop over on the way. The rooms were clean and the food was fairly good. The staff are friendly. The hotel overlooks a river with mountains in the backdrop. The view is extremely scenic. Our room overlooked both the front and the back of the hotel and so we had excellent views. In the morning we walked down to the river bank and collected a few pebbles. This is a good place to relax and recharge the tired body before hitting the road again to Leh.,Smita K,/Profile/smitzzz,Mumbai,40
lahul_spiti,we had booked our stay at Ibex Jispa enroute Leh from Manali.  The rooms were comfortable with Hot water facility.. just what you need after a tiring journey from manali to Jispa.  The location is also very good.. just near the river side.. quite picturesque. we were alloted the lake facing rooms after convincing the front desk mgr..   The food is quite delicious with hot rotis being served on your table. basic North indian cuisine but tasty nonetheless.  its better to stay in a hotel in Jispa rather than a tents at such an altitude..,Shr_Mod,/Profile/Shr_Mod,"Mumbai, India",40
lahul_spiti,"En route M anali to Leh, you will find very few lodging options at Jispa.Ibex is one of those few. What I liked about the place were its food and location. For such a remote location, the food that was served was excellent. It's a fixed menu but there's a variety. It is located on the highway with the river flowing by just opposite to it and with an excellent view of the mountains. The amenities offered are very basic but you do get a TV connection. You can take a long walk to the nearby monastery or just cross the road and go sit by the river.",dukeEarth,/Profile/dukeEarth,"New Delhi, India",30
lahul_spiti,Stayed in August 2012 - nice place to stopover for a night after a very long day from Manali. Room was clean & comfortable enough (beds a bit hard though!) - bathroom was only ok but had plenty of hot water which was most welcome. Staff were friendly & the food was very good. Excellent views across the valley & of the river & just a short stroll to the river to sit & contemplate nature!,SCS123,/Profile/SCS123,"Manama, Bahrain",30
lahul_spiti,"This place is very scenic and located just opposite to the the Bagga River and rest covered with mountains,so its brezzy all the time.The rooms are okey but what disappointed was the Cleanlyness of the place.We could see a layer of dust on the bed and ciggert butts on the floor and wasnt happy type.They dont have room service too.So for a cup of tea,you have to come down to the restaurent on the ground floor.And for Rs.2400 with MAP plan,i think it was expensive.But if you are keen to stay in this scenic location then i would suggest you to go little down, i mean around 1km from Ibex hotel towards Darcha,you will find nice lodges and some tents on the riverbanks for Rs.800 or soo with food.Please dont forget to visit the river and do spend some time on the banks.As the Sun",DSMAndrews,/Profile/DSMAndrews,"Gurgaon, Haryana, India",30
lahul_spiti,"Experience the gushing river (Chilled water), rock mountains and snowfall.  Food is good.  Unforgettable experience was river side walk. Best place to relax.  As far as I know, only hotel in JISPA.  Worth a stay.  Rooms are clean.  And yes I traveled in July 2010.",Samata2k,/Profile/Samata2k,"Torrance, California",50
lahul_spiti,"This hotel is located in a very pictureque location right on the highway.   After a long, tedious drive the hotel is heaven sent.  I would recommend for anybody to stay here rather than in Sarchu, because the weather is much more hospitable here and your chances of suffering AMS is much more at Sarchu than in Jispa.  The room that we stayed in was in the second floor, was quite clean with running hotwater.  The restaurant served some chilled beer and a nice spread of buffet dinner.  After dinner you can walk along the picturesque highway which is sorrounded by majestic mountains.  The scenery is breathtaking.",Gopalakrishna H,/Profile/trekkerMangalore,"Mangalore, India",30
lahul_spiti,"The hotel is situated right next to the river and was the only one in all of Jispa at the time of writing this review. Fortunately, it did not allow its monopoly to affect its quality of rooms and service. Its a large property, with large rooms, bathrooms and comfortable beds. The staff are friendly and responsive, although the lack of a room service option was a bit of a bummer. However the cost of the room includes buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner (veg and non-veg options) and they will even provide you with a packed lunch in case you will be out during lunchtime. Very decent place to stay for about Rs. 2700 per night (including the food), and we would definitely like to go back again. If there is any room for improvement, its that they should provide room heaters (they",Sumanta,/Profile/neversaygbye,"Calcutta, India",40
lahul_spiti,"If you're travelling the Manali Leh highway you know there aren't many options. I just wanted to put other travelers' minds at ease - this hotel is perfectly comfortable and is probably the best option in Jispa / Sarchu. Your alternative is a tent camp. We weren't impressed by what looked like a vomit stain near the matress on the floor that they provided for our 3rd person, but no one's perfect. Hot water is not 24-hours and you might want to check that they switch it on when you arrive if you plan on cleaning up in the evening. The food is good, the tea is great, and the staff is really friendly.",ambermai,/Profile/ambermai,UK,20
