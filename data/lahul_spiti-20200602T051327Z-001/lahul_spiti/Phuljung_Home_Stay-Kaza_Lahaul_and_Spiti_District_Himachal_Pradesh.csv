lahul_spiti,"We were recommended the Phuljung Homestay by our wonderful driver Saleem. And it was a great experience. Firstly, the host Sonam & his family are very hospitable & helpful with whatever we wanted. The rooms are spacious and well maintained. The rooms have a beautiful view of the river surrounded by mountains.  The homestay is located away from the noise & crowd of Kaza, and yet not too far. This was ideal for us. The food was delicious and home cooked, just what we love. Overall, a wonderful stay at Phuljung and we highly recommend it.",Abhishek Ponia,/Profile/abhishekponia,"Mumbai, India",50

lahul_spiti,"We stayed there for 2 nights,07/10/2019 and 08/10/2019 while we were on our Spiti valley tour. The location of the home stay is fantastic. Its just beside the HPTDC hotel and offers a splendid view. The owner is a very kind hearted person. He made our stay superb. Even he allowed us to call at home from his personal mobile.",Ranjan1972,/Profile/Ranjan1972,"Kolkata, India",50
lahul_spiti,I reached Kaza a day too early. Mr. Giacho received me with much pleasure n immediately discussed plans for hiring a bike next day both for Chandrataal n local sightseeing. It turned out bike's r not rented for Chandrataal. He gave me one of his best roome overlooking the Spiti river. The sight was wow. A flat cold expanse with bright moon. He offered me dinner but I thought of eating out at the market. Ample hot water at such a forlorn place was a gift. Next morning he cooked breakfast. But the best part was he gave me his BSNL no. Mobile to me to b used as long as I stayed there. (Other connections don't work).,Sanndip Dey,/Profile/Sanndip,,50
lahul_spiti,"The place offers a splendid view of the kaza city as it is on the one end of the Kaza. The home stay is on the banks of river Spiti( totally dried with little water though). The owner (Julson, hope d spelling is correct) is a very helpful an nice guy. Made us feel at home. The food preparation is good. Do also try local food preparations.The interiors were tastefully decorated with wooden flooring, typical of dat area. Overall a nice experience to stay.",Attul Handoo,/Profile/attulh,"New Delhi, India",50
