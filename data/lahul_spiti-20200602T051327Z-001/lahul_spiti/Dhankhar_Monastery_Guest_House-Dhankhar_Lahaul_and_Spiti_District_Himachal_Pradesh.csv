lahul_spiti,I visited the Dhankhar Monastery in August 2019 and had a wonderful time. The monks are super friendly and happy to help in any way. Sitting in on Puja and talking with them on a personal level. The people from the village are equally as lovely and welcoming.   Definitely my favourite place to be in Spiti Valley. Both the old and new monasteries are beautiful and have breathtaking views over the valley. And the scenery is outstanding.  Accommodation at the monastery is great and the food really delicious. You can sit and enjoy on the balcony overlooking the village and valley.  I loved it so much that I'm returning this year üòÅ,Sarah H,/Profile/Numberonesarah,,50

Rooms are Nice, cosy, spacious and very traditional. So, good place to be if one wants to taste the local food and wants to experience local culture..",Karan Sachan,/Profile/KaranSachan,"Varanasi, India",50
