lahul_spiti,"We stayed in Kaza for 3 nights while visiting the Spiti Valley and the Kunphen Sakya suited us well. It is a simple hotel with reasonable standards. The sleeping rooms are in a 3 story building right next to the monastery. My room was a good size with king sized bed, arm chairs and a coffee table. There was somewhat worn carpet on the floor. The bedding was clean and warm. The room also contained a kettle and tea making supplies but no cup or teaspoon. There was also nowhere to hang any clothes - not even a hook on the door. The bathroom was fairly standard with an individual geyser with a surprisingly good capacity and a western toilet.   There was no TV. Connectivity is a major issue in Taza in general so it isn't likely that there would be a signal so a TV is unlikely to be",Jane E,/Profile/JaneE604,"New York City, New York",40

lahul_spiti,We had a very comfortable stay at such a beautiful place Kaza at such a great height. Neat and clean room and washroom. They had a cute and cosy restaurant serving delicious food. The hotel was just next to the monastery and in front of the World's highest petrol pump. This place is recommendable! ðŸ˜Š,Taniya B,/Profile/83taniyab,"New Delhi, India",50
lahul_spiti,"The hotel is located in New Kaza, at a walking distance of ~10 minutes from Old Kaza and the market.   The amenities of the hotel are quite good for the price. I was told that the rooms are generally available ~2200 Rs for online booking. I booked it on the spot and got the room for 1500/- per night. It would have been a better deal to get it around ~1000.  The bed room was cozy and comfortable. The bathroom offered hot water throughout the day. The only problem was there was just one charging point. Though the hotel mentions the availability of free WIFI via a sticker at the reception, the same is available only near reception and dining area and not near the rooms. The wifi speed was minimal that allowed only whatsapp messages to arrive and would not serve any other internet",vabhatia,/Profile/vabhatia,"New Delhi, India",40
lahul_spiti,"We stayed in Kaza for 4 days and was very satisfied with this hotel. It has simple but cosy bedroom with clean bathroom. There was no wifi in room but you can get it at the common area. Which also has reading section with lots of good books.   Plus value for this hotel as it share the sam compound with Sakya Monastery. Every morning we can hear the chanting and even can join the prayer.   This hotel is very accessible too. We took bus from Tabo and told the bus driver to drop us off at the Gas station, which apparently very near to the hotel.   The staff was very friendly and helpful. They gave the best service and the best food. The owener, Mr Tsering is really nice. He's originally from Spiti and likes to tell stories about people there. They also informed us about the",Farah A,/Profile/faraha75,"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia",40
lahul_spiti,"A beautiful and a simple hotel with all the necessities that can be availed at a remote place like Spiti. The food is just extra ordinary. Tseringji, Poonam and Dinesh took excellent care of us. Since me and my wife were on our honeymoon, they put up balloons in our room and got us a fabulous cake (something that we did not expect in Spiti). They also had planned our entire trip and made sure that we had the most beautiful trip of our lifetime. I would definitely love to go back and stay there for much longer.  P.S. Do try their special pancake.  Also during our time there, electricity was erratic since Spiti being so remote.",ShailN,/Profile/ShailN,"Mumbai, India",40
lahul_spiti,"It's good enough for a night's stay. Like most of the hotels in these areas, rooms are pretty ordinary and un kept. And bathrooms are usually a mess. So, don't expect much in terms of room comfort. Food is good enough, and so is staff. So, this is one plus point.  But don't expect the staff to serve you in early morning hours or late night hours as they don't seem to be used to it. The morning service begins after 7 to 10 in the night. Those are the normal working hours of their staff, beyond this you are asking for special favors.  Anyways, it's a okay place to stay on your journey with no problems as such.",Rudra_Pan,/Profile/Rudra_Pan,"Mumbai, India",30
lahul_spiti,The hotel is located next door of the Kunphen Monastery . You can literally listen to the bells and prayer from your room. It was very soothing. There is in house canteen and neat and clean cosy rooms.,HIMADRI666,/Profile/HIMADRI666,"Rudrapur, India",40
lahul_spiti,"Kunphen Sakya guest house is part of Sakya abode, run by Tsering Bodh who is a great host and also planned our Spiti trip with incredible spiti. The guest house is a small cozy place just next to the Monastery. Rooms are spacious and clean, you get hot water, good food and service at the cafe/restaurant. It felt like coming back home after our 3 day trip to nearby villages. The location of this place is just perfect. Thank you :)",rituspace,/Profile/rituspace,"Mysuru (Mysore), India",40
lahul_spiti,"My family stayed at Kunphen Sakya for 3 nights. Lovely location, 5minute walking from the local bazaar, It is a simple but well done hotel in a Monastery complex in Kaza. Our trip of SPITI valley was arranged by Tsering the owner of Kunphen Sakya, is a very pleasant gentleman. Room was decent size and clean. Our family was very well attended by the hotel staff. Restaurant was also clean and service was great. Food was tasty and they also accommodated our taste requirement few times. I was glad that we stayed in this place for our memorable trip of Spiti valley. I would recommend this place",CJain,/Profile/CJain,"Mumbai, India",40
lahul_spiti,"This is a fabulous location as it is the only hotel within the Monastery complex. You can soak in the most intimate views of the Monastery from the rooms or while chilling in the outdoor sitting area. On the opposite side are Kaza's iconic stupas and prayer wheels. The morning prayers gently fill the air and make for a really spiritually charged experience. The monks allow everyone to attend the prayers so staying there makes it very convenient.   The rooms are basic, as are all others in Kaza, but the new cafe is fantastic. Beautiful and cozy,  they have a hundred prefer flags hanging from the ceiling and sure made me feel very blessed. Do try their incredible Spitian menu with dishes you'll never find elsewhere (yes, there is more to it than momos and thukpa) . After a long",Bindiya_Murgai,/Profile/Bindiya_Murgai,Ketti,40
lahul_spiti,"Stayed in Kunphen Sakya in August 2015 on our trip to Kaza. This is a very nice hotel and is run by Tsering Bodh who also runs Sakya Abode locAted closeby. We had a great time here, the place was nice and so were the staff. Tsering is a really great host - will take care of your stay and has a host of knowledge regarding places to visit, routes to take etc. Do stay here or in Sakya Abode if in Kaza.",Gunigagan,/Profile/Gunigagan,,50
