lahul_spiti,"Located at the entry of the town, It has bright, large and clean rooms.  the family is very nice and they served us an excellent dinner. Good place to explore all the spiti valley. I advise to have 1 or 2 night here.",Tommaso G,/Profile/tommasog438,,50
lahul_spiti,A peaceful place to stay and calm yourself . Very less population makes it a quiet place and the view is just awesome. Superb view of snow mountains and  scenic beauty can be seen. But take at least 2-3 days of planned holiday for kaza and enjoy nearby areas,abhijain321,/Profile/abhijain321,,40
