lahul_spiti,We are extremely sorry about your experiences in our homestay Sridevi and Jamila. Due to our busy schedule we for the first time in 19 years gave our loving homestay on lease. Unfortunately we gave it on lease to a wrong person. But now we won't make the same mistake again and we are running it by ourselves from now. Sorry for the inconvenience.   -Amchi Norbu Gyaltsen.,drnorgyal66,/Profile/drnorgyal66,"Himachal Pradesh, India",50
lahul_spiti,We stayed there during the start and end of our trek.  The rooms are spacious and staff is courteous. And this sums up all the good thing about this homestay. There is no homestay like atmosphere. The place is not very clean especially the bathrooms.. Food is also not good.  Go there if you have no other option.,Sridevi W,/Profile/srideviw,,10
lahul_spiti,"Had a horrible experience here.  Yes, the rooms were good and price extremely affordable but does this qualify for a Homestay? Akshay is either high on weed or drunk but he doesn't shy away from preaching the ""way of life"" to others. Spending most of his time getting high at German bakery or a nearby pub he felt it was his duty to reprimand us when our group was conversing on some light topic during breakfast and not going out exploring Kaza. ( Mind you, this was our first day in Kaza and we planned to take the day easy as we still had to acclimatize to the high altitude) Not only that, he complained about us to us. He was never there in the homestay and his poor, hardworking staff received no instructions from him. Would I suggest this place to anyone? Unless you want to dope",Jamila K,/Profile/JamilaK81,,10
