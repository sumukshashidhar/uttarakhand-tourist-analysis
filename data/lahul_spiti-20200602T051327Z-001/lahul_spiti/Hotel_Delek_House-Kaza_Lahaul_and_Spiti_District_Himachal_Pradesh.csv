lahul_spiti,"Being a kaza hotel, its location was good with marvellous views. Rooms are big and clean. It is located at appropriate place where you will find hotel deyzor at walking distance - which is best place to eat in kaza (You can search here for stay also but as it is a no 1 hotel in kaza, many time people don't get stay on season dates) that is a advantage. Food we had not tried here except breakfast which was good and agreeable.",Manoj_Makwana,/Profile/Manoj_Makwana,"Bharuch, India",40
lahul_spiti,"If you want to feel like home in Kaza, this is the place you are looking for!! Rahul-ji is a wonderful host and a fantastic human being who helped us not only cozying in but also in getting a medical help for my friends. Being the group leader, I would have had not asked for anything more. The food is amazing, they say the best in kaza. Thank you so much for the wonderful stay :) ",Scenic791381,/Profile/Scenic791381,,50
lahul_spiti,"Have stayed four nights , the view room is very good. Room was warm and cozy. The service is average as we didn""t get any non-veg food from menu. They do not have laundry facility although promised they will on the first day. Good tasty veg food.  Was filled with bollywood shooting people who were noisy from 3:30 in the night. Had facility of hot water both drinking and in washroom.",Saibal S,/Profile/saibals2016,"New Delhi, India",30
lahul_spiti,"Decent hotel with proper amenities. Staff are helpful. Rooms have good views. Wifi, though advertised, was not available. Food was ok. Connectivity remains a problem at kaza though (no fault of the hotel). Location is good with short trips to market and walking distance to kaza monastery.",Indranath Banerjee,/Profile/Indranath03,"Kolkata, India",40
lahul_spiti,Had been with my family and friends for spiti drive. One of my friend recorded me about this place. We stayed there for couple of days. This is one of the most hostile places in kaza. Staff is very friendly the rooms are clean and cozy. They will help you in getting lot of information about the places around and the culture of this part of the world.  Highly recommended ....,DeodarCottage,/Profile/DeodarCottage,"Kotgarh, India",50
lahul_spiti,"I stayed at Delek House for one night in June, 2017 on our trip to Spiti Valley. The rooms had an exceptional view overlooking Spiti River & Mountains. The staffs were helpful. Overall experience was nice but put one thing in mind if you book hotel online, always call the hotel to confirm your booking. The reason is internet connectivity is very poor in Kaza. Many times they didn't get mail from booking site.",Fakhre A,/Profile/CAFakhreAlam,"Ranchi, India",40
lahul_spiti,"Delek House is a hotel run by an artist who hails from Mysore. Akshay, is a great host who can help you stroll around the market areas, bylanes of Kaza exploring the untouched beauty it is.   The rooms are neat and clean. The hotel meets hygiene standards well. The food served is just amazing. Nothing fancy, but the journey till Kaza is so tiring yet a scrumptious bowl of daal will fill you with joy once you reach here. I have no clue if they serve eggs or not while taking a stroll I asked him if is there a place we can have some boiled eggs. He laughed it off since Kaza is a place with less comfort and luxuries of our daily lives. But next morning on our breakfast table they did served us eggs. Small gestures always counts for a traveler like me.   The team makes sure you go",PoonamChakraborty,/Profile/PoonamChakraborty,"New Delhi, India",50
lahul_spiti,"Overall quality was awesome. Room was neat and clean. We visited in second week of august and this time around Kaza was at its best, and the view from the Hotel room was like Serenity at its best. Food options were wonderful.",escaes,/Profile/escaes,"Mumbai, India",40
lahul_spiti,"We stayed at Delek House for three nights in august 2017, before our trip to Spiti Valley. The room had an exceptional view, and the food was freshly prepared at every meal. The staff was kind. I would suggest it over any other place in the main street",lagiugiu,/Profile/lagiugiu,piacenza,40
lahul_spiti,"Run by an artist from Mysore,  this is a great place to stay and eat.  Every detail has been given attention to and Akshay will make sure he takes care of all your needs.    Located at the entrance and close by to the market ",nagakarthijk,/Profile/nagakarthijk,"Bengaluru, India",50
lahul_spiti,"It indeed was an amazing stay at Delek House for 2 nights recently. Comfortable clean rooms, wonderful food. Tried the Spanish Omelette in the morning one day and had their Buffet on one of the nights which was great. The ambiance is also cool. In addition to the Restaurant Area, there are other areas on every floor where you can sit and relax. Was nice to be around. Thanks Delek House, Cheers!",tan412,/Profile/tan412,"New Delhi, India",50
lahul_spiti,"I had went with my friends to this place (Delek House), I thoroughly enjoyed this place. People here were very helpful, especially Mr. Negi. We had a memorable time here and always remember this place when we talk about spiti. Couldn't have asked for a better service. I am surely going to come here again in the future. Great view from the room, you get to see the mountains and the mighty spiti river. Enjoyed the food as well. Not sure whether Mr Negi remembers me.. Jai Hind janab..

lahul_spiti,"hi, I had a booked two rooms.But on reaching there they informed me that all the rooms are booked. In spite of having the confirmed voucher, there was no accommodation for me. They told me that they will arrange some alternative accommodation which was about 4km outside the city. We were very tired so had to settle for that very ordinary accommodation.They are following this malpractice daily. They are showing the photo of hotel Delek and then offering some ordinary and cheap rooms for double the cost. This is cheating and I want action taken against them and I want my refund.",Navjot S,/Profile/navjots34,,10
lahul_spiti,"On my recent visit to Spiti, I did take some time to check out hotels in quieter New Kaza and the thing that struck me about this hotel was it's location firstly facing the mountains and thereby giving you an unobstructed beautiful view from your room. Wonderfully done up clean, cozy rooms and an equally awesome restaurant serving delicious food. I gave their buffet a try and it turned out to be the best food I had in Kaza.   Lastly a passionate, hospitable and friendly owner - Akshay who knows these mountains and loves Spiti and what he does and it shows in his hotel's service. Total support to him and would love to see this hotel reach new heights. I know where I'm staying on my next Spitian sojourn !",Tristan F,/Profile/471tristanf,"Mumbai, India",50
lahul_spiti,"It was amazing as Tshering arranged a great farewell party  for all the hoteliers and we were also invited which was super cool , had great fun , thank u so much fr a great time  ,  I would love to re visit kaza  and stay here . It is close to the monastry and also to the river bedside ..   Cheers    Pawan",pawan0782verma,/Profile/pawan0782verma,"Shimla, India",50
lahul_spiti,"We stayed at Delek house for a couple of days during The Himalayan Crossing race. Both Tsering and Dinesh Negi are exceptionally warm people. They not only worked with us for the foot race logistics across the Spiti Valley but on the days we stayed with him at Delek house, we were treated to good food, on foot exploration of Kaza, stories about the highest Asian village Komic and all the goodness of the Spiti Valley's hospitality. They made things possible to ensure we had everything on request for food and other amenities. A clear and good place to stay while in Spiti Valley.",simmsimm,/Profile/simmsimm,India,50
lahul_spiti,"Dear Travelers, Delek house is the best hotel and restaurant in Kaza. The rooms are large and well appointed with warm , comfortable beds. The bathrooms are modern with hot water and running water. Room service is excellent and the food homemade and finger licking good! The view of the surrounding mountains with river Spiti from the large windows is breathtaking! And Tserin Negi, who has done it all, is a gem of a person. Very polite, very honest and very helpful, its a blessing to be in the company of such an angel in such remoteness. I've given five stars but could've given more had there been an option.",Amitraghat,/Profile/Amitraghat,,50
