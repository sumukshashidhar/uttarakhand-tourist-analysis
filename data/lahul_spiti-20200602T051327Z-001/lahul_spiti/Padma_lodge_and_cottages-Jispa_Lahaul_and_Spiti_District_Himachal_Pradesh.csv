lahul_spiti,"C'est un camp de tante ni mieux ni moins bien que les 3 autres utilisé pour notre parcours au Ladakh. Nous étions 14 en moto Je n'y ai pas mal mangé, la tente état assez grande les lit assez confortable .Le matin il pleuvait le sol de la tente était tout mouillé et les affaires aussi. La douche était chaude il y avait une chaudière extérieur qui marchait au bois ,quelqu'un l'a allumé lorsque nous sommes arrivés et une demi heure après nous avions de l'eau chaude.",christophe h,/Profile/christopheh348,bauvin,30
lahul_spiti,This is located on the river banks of Baga. One side green mountain and other side is the river and lot of trees are surrounding the place. It has fixed structure as well as tents. Rooms are very cozy and beds are nice and soft. Food is good. I like the place.,Sumit S,/Profile/sumit824,"Mumbai, India",50

lahul_spiti,"Stayed here durimg our 500cc Royal Enfield mobike Leh to Delhi trip, courtesy ""Venture on Wheels' tour company, run by Anji and Asheesh Mehra. The Lodge was clean and we also managed to get some hot water. Staff were helpful and the meals above average. I loved the breakfast venue, where you could sit in a narrow strip next to a bubbling brook. The site also had tents incase the rooms were full.",Anil276,/Profile/Anil276,"Perth, Australia",40
lahul_spiti,We had booked this hotel for overnight stay at jispa for our Road trip to leh..and it was a great experience .. after a tiring journey due to 8hours traffic in Rohtang pass all that we needed was a comfortable place with good rooms and a hot water bath.. this place is worth staying and the staff was very helpful and courteous .. recommended for families as well as friends ,ADICool,/Profile/ADICool,"Mumbai, India",40
lahul_spiti,Very good experience overall. The location is awesome with the property based just near a small rivulet.. and grazing field for cattle.. (you get feel of living near grasslands n pastures) and you can view snow peaked mountains too. The rooms are pretty  good. The food is just amazing.  Through out our entire leh Ladakh trip this place offered us the best food. The staff is friendly.,Avani S,/Profile/AvaniS92,,50
lahul_spiti,"Had a great stay at this place. We were actually booked for 1 night but stay got extended forcibly as Manali- Leh road got closed for 2 days. But never regretted. Had a v nice stay here. 1. Location_ Excellent . On the highway so that city maze and narrow lanes are avoided. V picturesque, at the foot of  rugged Hills. 2. Good spacious rooms. 3. Absolutely superb staff , especially Mr.Sagar who is always available to help. Very Patient nice young Man. 4. Very good sumptuous food. 5. Private secured parking, facilities for drivers.  I do have some suggestions though-  a) You must put a boiler for hot water in Bathrooms b) Heater in rooms.  Above are not too expensive and , to me a must, since temperatures there go v v cold.  Will sure recommend and visit again.  Once again special",eternal_traveller_12,/Profile/eternal_traveller_12,"Pune, India",40
