lahul_spiti,"The room was pretty spacious. Also it had a big window with a view of waterfall in the distance. Perfectly designed room direction. The food was really nice and simple. Not too much spices, just like home. And the owner helped in many small requests which is a big deal according to me.  Nice roads nearby the hotel to go jogging in the morning.",yash b,/Profile/909yashb,"Vadodara, India",50
lahul_spiti,Stayed overnight while driving down from Leh to Mumbai. What can I say.....for 1200 bucks /night you get a big comfortable double bedded room with attached bathroom having running hot and cold water plus excellent views. The owner was most helpful and even gave us some local incense gratis. Food was basic but freshly prepared and served hot. And yes...you get parking space inside the compound. All in all a great place. Highly recommended.,Rinchen W,/Profile/bobbywangdi,"Mumbai, India",40
