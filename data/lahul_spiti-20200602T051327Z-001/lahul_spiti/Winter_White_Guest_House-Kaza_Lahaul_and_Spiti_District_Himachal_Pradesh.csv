lahul_spiti,"Stay at winter white Kaza guest house (#spiti) was quite comfortable, I was solo with a travel group, allotted a room on 3rd floor and the view was just phenomenal. They food was also decent and the staff was helpful as we timely got anything that we wanted like hot water, tea and all. The roof was open and we were allowed to go so at night we went up there and the night sky was one of the best I've ever seen made some milkyway timelapses and all. Tip: try to get up early if you wanna get a bath as hot water runs out if you wake up late.",Vipul Sharma (Dorian thoughts),/Profile/vipulsharma_dorian,"New Delhi, India",40
lahul_spiti,"We went with high hopes to this hotel since it came highly recommended but post-stay were left extremely disappointed.  The attitude of the staff was lax, no soap and tissue in the bathrooms, Soaps were given when requested for twice. The afternoon food was served in the evening and the reason given was lack of adequate staff. All this was still bearable. What made things worse was no electricity through the night in -2 degree temperature.  We had to leave at six in the morning so requested for a morning alarm and packed breakfast -- none of which were provided. Not even a hot cup of tea. Would not recommend this place to anyone. .",Purnima Sharma,/Profile/929purnimas,"New Delhi, India",10
lahul_spiti,"stayed at this property on 16 September 2019. Good room, good bathroom with geyser fitted in bathroom.  The geyser did not function (electricity power was available), and we complained at the reception 3 times, but the problem was not solved, and we requested hot water in a bucket, but they said it was not possible.",Globe T,/Profile/globet710,"Mumbai, India",30

lahul_spiti,"Winter White is one of the best guest houses I've seen in Spiti. Andy, the owner is the nicest guy ever! Also his brother Ranjit, and Shiva the cook.

lahul_spiti,Best thing was owner and staff were too courteous and helpful. Even they served us 100% Jain Food as per our requirement and taste. Enjoyed different types of tea. one suggestion is to keep lift... They provide all the facilities and even wifi where u cannot even expect a network. ,ripen s,/Profile/ripens,"Morbi, India",50

lahul_spiti,"My stay at Winter White was a part of the package I took for Spiti Valley. Spiti being a place which is quite unexplored I was already prepared for not really high expectation for my stay, but this particular place truly lived upto my expectation. Me being allergic to dust they made sure to clean my room every day. The care taker was very prompt with any service one ask them be it baking a cake for someone's birthday to preparing special upvas food for me. Very hospitable staff, right place to stay in Kaza",Akanksha S,/Profile/AkankshaS160,"New Delhi, India",40
lahul_spiti,"Staff out there is very helpful , rooms are value for money , food as usual expensive like in all kaza due to tribal region. View from rooms are awesome . These guys can guide you well , they also have links in manali , chandetal so you can take help from them. ",ashish s,/Profile/ashishs3153,"Dharamsala, India",50
lahul_spiti,Traveled in a group.. rooms were decent lacking in cleanness.. size of rooms was ok.. lacked service quality.. staff was not very helpful.. food availability was limited and for limited time. guess this part is not visited by many so they have not come to quality stay n food part.. hope they will improve in near future..,Gaurav4,/Profile/Gaurav4,"New Delhi, India",30
