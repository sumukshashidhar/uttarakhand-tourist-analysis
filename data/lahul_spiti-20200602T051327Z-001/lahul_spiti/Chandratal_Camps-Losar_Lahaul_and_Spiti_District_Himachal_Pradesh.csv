lahul_spiti,He is a cheat. I went to many places with prior booking but have never seen such a dishonest person. We contacted him after reading very good reviews about his camp. He promised me to arrange a car with driver for the entire Spiti valley trip and also promised to book hotels for us. He demanded advance money from us 4 months prior to our trip and started sending me WhatsApp messages almost everyday saying it will be difficult for us to get accommodation if we delay. He seemed so active before he got the money from me via online transfer but once he got it he became absolutely silent. I kept on asking him repeatedly whether he had started the booking procedure or not. But he did not reply to any of my sms and did not pick up my call. One day after repeated attempts he picked up,Rituparna D,/Profile/RituparnaD55,,10
lahul_spiti,"We booked for mid August with Jamaica due to positive reviews. A token advance was paid. Later due to adverse weather conditions we were unable to reach Spiti on time. We spoke to Jamaica for cancellation; the guy responded on email that he will refund by 26th of August. I kept chasing him for the refund but after the first discussion he stopped taking calls, responding to whatsapp or emails. The guy is not a clean operator; at least should have clear communication that he has no intention of refunding the money. It feels dishonest and a cowardly behavior when you don't bother to speak to your customers. My only suggestion is choose wisely and be careful when you pay this guy any advance money.

lahul_spiti,"I don't have the option to give it negative rating, we visited Chandratal in June 2018 and booked tents for 7 people for 2 days in 6 months advance after reading the reviews and more importantly many other camps in that region are not available online.  About my experience it was very terrible we reached around 8-9 PM in the night and when our car got stuck in nullah for about 2 hrs one of us went to the camp and asked from help from the staff, to our surprise they were not at all helping and just standing and watching, they even don't have any tools/ropes. Later they just left us there and we were able to manage somehow to get out of that problem. When we reached at camp they just try to accommodate 3 people in tents which can only accommodate 2, after much argument they gave",Tribhuwan,/Profile/TribhuwanS8,,10
lahul_spiti,"This one of the most popular place to stay in Chandratal campsite and in per with Parasol camps. I visited this place in June'18 along with friends. The tents had good built quality and had attached bathrooms. The bed and toilets were reasonably clean but had major water crisis. the food was warm and taste great, though we didn't found the staffs to be of much help or friendly.  The walk to lake is nearly a hour and first part of drive/ walk is tough. But you can easily do it yourself without any guide.",Manik Roy,/Profile/Manik_loves_mountain,"Kolkata, India",40
lahul_spiti,"I am kind of surprised at reading positive reviews of people about Jamaica. We have had a terrible experience with him.  We had done a booking for 4 people with him for Spiti for August this year and duly paid him a token amount of Rs 20000 in June when we had finalised everything. About a month before the trip, we had to cancel because of some unforeseen circumstances.  We spoke to him about the matter and at first he said that he would refund a part of the money. Later when I called him again for an update, he said that he would refund the full amount and gave me a tentative date. And thus began a 4 month long period of chasing him for the refund. Everytime he would give some random date but the money was never returned.  Now he no more takes our calls. We have tried calling",Vipasha A,/Profile/VipashaAdlakha,"Navi Mumbai, India",10
lahul_spiti,"Thanks to the owners we felt warmly welcomed and comfortable ...the facilities, the rooms , bathrooms were good and so was the food....very nice people....the only problem is that this camp is located in. Lonely location as compared to the others ( others are all together .. one next to another) ...plus there is lighting at night in the other camps which was not available near ours ...this did not give us company to stay awake and watch the milky way...it was scary and no lighting ...etc...only negative in the camp...stay wise perfect..",soni23,/Profile/soni23,"Mumbai, India",40
lahul_spiti,"My broyfriend and I were in Kaza and from there we decided to go to Chandartal Lake. Before leaving a nice guy in Kaza recommended us to stay with Jamaica. (Thank you!) We arrived quite late after struggeling with the roads. Jamaicas Camp was the nearest to the lake. After going to the lake we arrived to his camp.  The facilities from his camp are really good. The tents are really comfortable, the bed and all the blankets he provides, plus a bathroom attached to the tent. Everything less expected in a place like this.  Dinner and breakfast were included and they were waaah! Chaai was super tasty and food was next level! :)  He and the staff there were nice, friendly people.  Thank you Jamaica for everything! we will meet the next in Goa for sure! ;)",Odyssey820595,/Profile/Odyssey820595,,50

Jamaica managed our transport, Accommodation, food and off course Camp at Chadrataal.  It was perfect choice. From drivers to Hotel everything was perfect.  We had excellent and comfortable stay at Green Height ( Shimala) , Hotel Apple Pi ( Sangala), Spitivally (Kaza), Mood Home Stay and Wild Rose( Manali). The camp at Chandrataal was superb and well equipped with all basic facilities. The man behind successful and memorable trip was Jamaica. More over Jamaica is Great Human being.

I started using all mediums (phone calls, whatsapp calls, whatsapp messages) with Jamaica effective mid of May to get my bookings done for their swiss camps with attached bathrooms. Jamaica was responsive to my queries whenever he had network and we agreed on 2 camps to be booked for me for the day of my visit.

lahul_spiti,"I've stayed with Jamaica at his camps on Chandratal on numerous occasions from 2013 to last year as well. Jamaica is a great host and ensures personally that each of his guest's stay is memorable. The only one at Chandratal to provide excellent meals (basmati rice and branded flour) and unlimited tea-coffee, he never lets you have a dull moment and quite often had accompanied guests on a visit to the lake on full moon nights.

lahul_spiti,This camping site is one the first few camps which started at Chandratal lake. The owner treats you like his own family and serves delicious food over stories of the lake. The chicken curry he served was out of the world.  Comfortable tents with comfortable bedding inside gives you sound sleep even if the temperature drops at night.
