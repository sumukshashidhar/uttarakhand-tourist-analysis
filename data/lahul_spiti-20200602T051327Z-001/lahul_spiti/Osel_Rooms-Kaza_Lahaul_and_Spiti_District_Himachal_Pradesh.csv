lahul_spiti,"This location also owns I believe the Sol Cafe nearby in Kaza. This cafe is based on an eco theme and one can rest there reading magazines and eating good cakes or other sweetmeats and drinking a variety of ""green"" hot drinks. The Osel rooms where we stayed were sadly a disappointment. Our room had a slight smelt of sewage which was a bit off putting. Food was served exceedingly slowly but was adequate. Breakfast took an age to be served despite being extremely simple fare. There were three ""cooks"" in the kitchen. Maybe it was getting to the end of the season but we felt it was a let down and have told our Indian tour company of our disappointment.",David S,/Profile/davidsI6297QS,"Romsey, United Kingdom",30
lahul_spiti,"Clean rooms with hot water, two minute walk from the main market and a restaraunt right below the rooms, what more a traveller can ask for.  Osel Rooms is run by Spiti Ecosphere, a social organisation working for sustainable development in the valley and responsible tourism as well. Please stay there and support them in their endeavour.

lahul_spiti,"The few things I really liked the place are,  - It's super close to the main market or I should say it's in the main market. - If you have to eat so just have to walk downstairs and you have ""Taste of Spiti"". - If you want to rent a bicycle you can do it from there only. - They have outdoor seating which I so enjoyed in the cold days.  I had a good experience with them hope you'll enjoy your stay too.",Aakash Ranison,/Profile/aakashranison,"Pondicherry, India",50

lahul_spiti,"I stayed at Osel rooms when I was in Kaza the first time, and I couldn't be more happy about the place! The hosts, Neema and Lobsang, are utterly friendly guys who are always willing to help you out or answer your questions! They know a lot about the area and the activities around Kaza. Besides that the place is tidy and clean, and because there's a solar heater they can provide you with hot water (witch isn't something to take for granted in Spiti Valley...) Next to the Osel Rooms is a place called Taste Of Spiti which is owned by the same social enterprise, where you can eat delicious organic and local dishes! I ate breakfast and dinner there almost every day of my stay. Altogether I would definitely recommend Osel Rooms!

lahul_spiti,"Bad experince, Rats in room,No hot water, No toilet rolls,No towels. Went as a volunteer - was charged Rs 600 plus per nite for stay to work as volunteer ,and was put in a room was shared with three people -including a guy. Bad service - Felt cheated on the name of Ngo. Paid 10 k for 15 days stay, and could not even stay for more than 4 day. No attention or concern by the owner / management. Money minded set up.

lahul_spiti,I stayed in Osel rooms recently and found it extremely comfortable. Thanks for the lovely stay. It is close to phenomenal views of Kaza which is just 5 minutes walk away and is conveniently close to the market. Must stay.,Upasana K,/Profile/UpasanaK33,,50

lahul_spiti,"I stayed here for 4 days in October. it is very conveniently located just off the main market yet only a 5 minute walk from the main center. The rooms are  exceptionally clean and get ample sunlight throughout the day. The bathrooms are clean and have running hot water which is a major plus. The staff is ever-helpful and courteous. Also, the food at the restaurant on the ground floor is really good, must try the local bread !! This place is buzzing with travellers and volunteers who work for Ecosphere, a social enterprise, run by Ishita. She knows the Spiti region very well and was very helpful in drawing up an itinerary for me. I can't thank Norbu and Chhering and the other staff members enough for making Spiti a memorable trip. Highly recommended and definitely coming back",sachink693,/Profile/sachink693,,50
lahul_spiti,"I stayed at Osel rooms for 3 weeks, and found them clean and comfortable with hot water throughout the day (a major luxury in Spiti!) . The staff is very friendly and ensure you have a great stay. It is located very close to the market and bus stand in Kaza, which made it very easy for me to travel around Spiti. Their restaurant, Taste of Spiti, is right below the rooms - you can have a satisfying meal or hot cup of tea at any point in the day. The best part about staying here is that the money you spend is directly used to fund the activities of Ecosphere, a social enterprise in Spiti. Also, it is a great place to meet fellow travellers and the volunteers at Ecosphere. Ishita, who runs this gives great advice on where and how to travel in Spiti, which makes it much easier to",mahathi a,/Profile/mahathia,,50
