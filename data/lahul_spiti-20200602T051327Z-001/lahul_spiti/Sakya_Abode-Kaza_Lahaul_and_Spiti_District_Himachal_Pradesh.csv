lahul_spiti,"We are two women who went on an almost impromptu trip to Spiti. If not for Tsering sir (owner of Sakya Abode), Lamaji (arranged cabs for us) and Varun (a regular traveler to Spiti who introduced us to all these wonderful people), our trip would not have been memorable. Tsering sir is a perfect gentleman.  The driver we hired through some other contact in Shimla turned out to be unprofessional and he was flouting basic driving rules. We had couple of instances where our driver drove after having bhaang. But things turned really worse when he actually got drunk when in Kaza. The wonderful folks at Sakya Abode immensely helped us at handling the situation. Tsering sir reprimanded the driver.

Washing was strung out on lines, people were sprawled on wrought-iron chairs, sunning themselves and reading. A large room doubles as the reception and restaurant, and acts as a common room for the guests. It has sofas covered with Tibetan rugs arranged around a large table stacked with coffee-table books. The place seems to be very popular with bikers and backpackers. In fact, we met someone who had been staying there for a month.   Their local dishes are delicious!

lahul_spiti,This is the most upscale and popular hotel in Kaza. It is popular due to publicity made by groups who trek in Spiti region and by some bloggers. However our experience was not so nice. We had to wait for more than a hour for check-in as they are under-staffed. Again they pay less attention to the comfort factor. Let me clarify the point. During our stay we were told that they serve dinner from 7-9 pm. But as a big group checked in they changed dinner time to 9pm without any intimation to other boarders. Moreover that group started smoking and drinking in common area and neither the Manager nor the Owner of the property restricted them. The scenario suddenly became intimidating for us. I would not recommend the place for a family trip. ,gkpi,/Profile/gkpi,KOLKATA,20

lahul_spiti,"Well, I have stayed with Snow Lion and Sakya Abode on 3 of my trips and it is one of the most amazing places to stay in Himalayas. Tsering by heart is gem of a person and the hospitality he offers is just too good to be real, I swear !! Besides having PLENTY of knowledge as a specialist  expert of the region of Spiti Valley, Tsering is a tremendous host I must say. He helped us in every aspect of my 4 trips I had to Spiti Valley is last few years.  The rooms especially in Sakya Abode were very cozy even in the winter months of March and I love the way dining has been setup too. A small setup for you is also available in terms of Internet Cafe in the dining room itself. Market is at a walking distance from the shortcuts but you would like to know them first :) ...

Good location - adjacent to the monastery and just opposite the petrol pump. The market is a 15 minute walk away – the trip to makes for a pleasant stroll through town.  Tsering, who owns and manages the place and his business partner Vishesh (they collectively go by the name ‘IncredibleSpiti’) are great resources for information and are really helpful - be sure to seek out their advice while finalizing your itinerary.  Kunphen enjoys a steady stream of travelers from different parts of the world so there’s always room for fun conversation.

Second, because its walls are not made of concrete, so its a lot warmer in the super cold weather of Spiti. Also, the ambience of the rooms and the living room will make you feel like home.   The moment I got inside the living room to check for the rooms, I was greeted by Mr. Tsering, the owner of the property. He was reading a book in the cosy and perfectly lit living room. It was offseason and the hotel was closed but he was really kind enough to not only give us accommodation but to offer us super healthy food.

Rooms and bathrooms are kept spotlessly clean, great food, makes you certainly feel at home. The Kaza Monastery situated next to it leaves you instantly hypnotized.

A minute walk from the monastery and 5 minutes form the market, it is very conveniently located. The rooms are clean and cozy, and the old Tibetan construction gives an earthy feeling to the place.

We then had someone come to our rooms and ask us if we had any laundry for washing. Laundry service in the middle of a desert? My jaw almost dropped! The cook Deepak asked us what we wanted to eat before each meal and even put together a fantastic thupka on popular demand.

The hotel is clean with friendly stuff around. They also have descent broadband connection for your, otherwise missing, Internet moments.

However, I have to say that I had a fairly decent time in Sakya Abode. We reached the place at night and entrance didn't look very welcoming - in fact it looked sidey. But once I entered the place, I was pleasantly surprised. The corridors were brightly let and decorated with a lot of Tibetan artifacts.
