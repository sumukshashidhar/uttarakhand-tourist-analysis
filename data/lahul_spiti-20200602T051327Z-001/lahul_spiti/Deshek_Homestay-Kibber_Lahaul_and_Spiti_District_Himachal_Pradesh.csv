lahul_spiti,"The homestay had truly a Spiti feel to it. The host Indu is just fantastic and made our stay even more memorable with her insights into the local way of Spitians. The view from the rooms is just great both in the mornings and evenings.  The food served was tasty and hygienic. A suggestion to the host is to offer Spiti local food to the guests if they prefer it over standard North Indian fare that most tourists like. That would add greatly to the experience of a homestay.  The rooms are bright and airy with heaters. The heaters are a blessing. The toilets could be better in terms of cleanliness though (don't expect showers and other modern facilities, it is not a hotel, and Indu made sure we got hot water whenever we wanted). The village is surrounded by wildlife and we bumped",sidshirur,/Profile/sidshirur,"Gonikoppal, India",50
