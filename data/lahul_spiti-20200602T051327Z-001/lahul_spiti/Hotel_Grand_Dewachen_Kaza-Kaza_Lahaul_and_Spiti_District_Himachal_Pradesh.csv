lahul_spiti,"You will be able to see the direct view of Key Monastery & surrounded by huge mountains.The hotel ambiance is awesome. Its really an unbelievable that you get this kind of hotel in remote place like spiti. Very nice interior with use of locally available wood, the antique looks. It is managed by very small team of staff, but you won;t get chance for complain. They also have provision of OXYGEN cylinders for an emergency use. The food is just awesome. 100% recommended.  Only factor which make you think is Price. :-)",Vijay L,/Profile/VijayL170,,50
lahul_spiti,"Mansi, one of those people who think they have all the authority in the world. First she confirms the booking for 2 camps over the phone, warmly providing all the details required and then, overnight, takes a U turn and declines the reservation. After having received the mail of a decline, in surprise, when you call her to ask as to what really happened, she says since this is her personal number, shoe shouldn't be reached out. Nice. Madam, this was the very number you took our reservation from in first place. Nevertheless, the worst that one can expect, she blocks you completely. The whole trip and planning goes in vain only because one manager here has an ego of the size of a mountain. You, madam, are the most unprofessional individual I have ever come across in my life!",vivektyagi20,/Profile/vivektyagi20,,10
lahul_spiti,"A 5 star hotel in the Spiti valley would be totally incongruous. The Grand Dewachan is exactly what is wanted when travelling, off the beaten track in this amazing location. It is more a hostel than a hotel and the interaction with the staff and other guests is what makes it a special experience. The rooms are rustic, but all the facilities function and the catering, while basic is in keeping with the entire experience. Will be back!",John S,/Profile/johnsW2545LK,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",30
lahul_spiti,"Visited this hotel with my family last year.   Hotel Grand Dewachen at Kaza is a royal luxury hotel made with local mud walls and ceilings retraining the Spitian tradition. Grand Dewachen is designed to amalgamate the traditional and the contemporary.  The retreat is ideally located and is reachable by road.  The retreat offers one of the most beautiful accommodation in Spiti with comfortable rooms with attached bathroom and running hot & cold water. Overlooking the mountains from afar, our rooms and balconies offer you breathtaking views of the valley and the Kye Monastery.   ",Arunverma,/Profile/Arunverma,"Amritsar, India",50
lahul_spiti,We spent two nights there before going on a trekking starting in Kibber. I absolutely loved the spacious room and the bed gave me two good sleeps (despite of the altitude I'm not used to). Also the food was a lot and super tasty and the service very attentive. This includes breakfast (lunch we had not there). All the hotel employees were exceptionally nice. The hotel is about 5 km from the village of Kaza away so it's quiet and very nice for a walk to the hills behind it. Even Bollywood stars stay over night there. We met a real one.,swiss_corinne,/Profile/swiss_corinne,"Bern, Switzerland",50
lahul_spiti,"We booked for 2 nights on 2nd and 3rd Oct and again for a night on 4th Oct17, during our one week program in Spiti Valley. Amidst all Tibetan looking buildings, this hotel only has a modern building. On our first stay, we stayed at room number 11 which was facing East and we had bright sunshine at 5:30 AM which affected our sleep, On our second visit, we stayed at room #8 and it was quite comfortable. We met the owner of this place on 4th Oct and he told us many stories about the hotel business in Spiti Valley. We stayed at his another property at Tabo and for one night at his tented property in Chandratal. The manager Sandeep was well informed person and he was telling adventurous stories of Snow Leopard safaris in this region in Feb- April time frame. The food was not good and",Qwelt,/Profile/Qwelt,"Chennai District, India",50
lahul_spiti,"We were told that our hotel was a bit out of town and, given the name, we envisioned something really nice in a charming location.  Instead, we were unpleasantly surprised to discover this big isolated building on a very ugly, barren  plain far from anything.  When we arrived at the hotel about  1 PM, we were met by two guys who looked like they had just been roused out of bed and greeted us in a way that made us feel anything but welcome. They were not professional or personal in any way. The hotel itself is large for the region and was clearly meant to be very modern and fancy, but it was already run-down and, for us, rather depressing.  There was a central space for sitting with a big skylight but no outside windows and there was no garden or anywhere pleasant to sit.  This",Victor F,/Profile/RBJoel,"Zichron Yaakov, Israel",10
lahul_spiti,"A plush property in middle of nowhere. Very nice rooms, beautiful building to stay with nothing surrounding it. Food was good too but the service team  was quite inexperienced. All seem to be newbies in the service industry.",Nimish Z,/Profile/nimish25,"Mumbai, India",40
lahul_spiti,"Kaza is a beautiful place and reaching Kaza is even more superb experience. Dewachen is really an Island surrounded by beautiful scenery. The place is very quite and the hospitality is very good, perhaps the best in that region. The food is good. The decor of the place is also nicely done. All the places to visit is also close by.",Katfour,/Profile/Katfour,New Delhi,40
lahul_spiti,"After the long drive from Naco to Kaza along the most treacherous roads in Himachal and a very bad stay in Naco..coming to The Grand Dewachen., in Rangrik village which is little ahead of Kaza was really like an Oasis for us. Warm welcome by staff especially Mahindra...immediate offer of Tea, coffee or whatever beverage we needed took off our tiredness. They happily made ginger lemon honey for us and offered cookies.  The luxurious rooms and the warm courtyard won our hearts.  Despite there being no electricity...We didn't even miss it. The hospitality of the staff is superb...happy to serve us tea coffee and even made garlic soup for us at no extra cost.  Food: in the middle of nowhere..and with no electricity we had no hope for good food but the cook and staff outdid",ParindaMerchant,/Profile/ParindaMerchant,"Mumbai, India",50
lahul_spiti,It is a beautiful property on the outskirts of kaza. The back ground is stark and beautiful. The owners had built the place with a lot of attention to details. Amazing buffet meals. The cook went out of the way to give us a treat. The owner was kind enough to take us around. He is an avid cyclist. Would recommend all to surely stay here.,navin_jaipur,/Profile/navin_jaipur,"Jaipur, India",50
lahul_spiti,We arrived at Grand Dewachain after a horrible night at one of the local kaza hotel. The stay here was amazing. Not many people locally recommend this cause they are a bit away from kaza. Slight expensive than the normal kaza hotels but worth every penny. Mahendar the Madawaska very helpful in guiding us. ,ec_13243,/Profile/ec_13243,"Ahmedabad, India",50
