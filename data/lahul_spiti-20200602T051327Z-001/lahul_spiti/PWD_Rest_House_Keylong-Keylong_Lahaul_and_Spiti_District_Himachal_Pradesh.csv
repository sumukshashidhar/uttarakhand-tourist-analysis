lahul_spiti,"Keylong is a approx 2 hours drive from Rohtang pass, administrative centre of Lahual & Spiti Valley. The weather is pleasantly cool and light woollen clothing during this time should be sufficient. At present, these are the only months in a year that Keylong is accessible, as the roads that connect to it are closed for the rest of the year due to heavy snowfall. Plans are underway to construct a tunnel through the Rohtang pass. Once completed, the tunnel would ensure that Keylong is accessible throughout the year while also reducing the time taken to travel to Keylong and making the journey much safer.  Driving to Keylong was an amazing experience. ",Rupali,/Profile/wanderwithrupali,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
lahul_spiti,"t was convenient to reach the hotel since we had our car for sight seeing. The spot was beautiful. Hotel staff had pleasant manners and they were hygienic and quick in service. The interiors and exteriors were excellent. Room was large, neat and clean with all the amenities required. Zero activities were present. From the hotel's window I could not see any view. Food we had from outside the hotel. Check-in and check-out was on time.I was with my family in this trip and I felt this hotel to be of value for cost. I would surely recommend this hotel to my friends.",AkashRoonwal,/Profile/AkashRoonwal,"Bengaluru, India",30
