lahul_spiti,"We found that we had left it too late to return to Manali from Leh and needed to stop in Sissu for the night. Well, what a chance find. The hotel was clean and comfortable and the rooms have great views. The staff are second to none and couldnâ€™t do enough for us. A chance find and we would certainly stay again.",scottstanton42,/Profile/scottstanton42,"Brisbane, Australia",40
