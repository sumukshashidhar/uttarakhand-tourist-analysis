lahul_spiti,"This a pleasant enough hotel in the small town of Keylong. I was given a room right on the street but was moved to a quieter room. Owners are lovely, food is good, great views from the back landing and there is a nice reading/meditation room. But beware the really hard mattresses",Margaret Carey,/Profile/Margaretlaurieton,,40
lahul_spiti,It was a great experience staying @Tashi. The entire staff was very friendly and have great customer focus values. I loved the stay and the ambience is truelu amazing. Also would like to mention that at such high altitude they are serving very good food.,m_vash81,/Profile/m_vash81,"Pune, India",50
lahul_spiti,"I was stuck in the worst snowstorm in Keylong since 1954. The snow blew out the electricity and phones and dropped the temperature to -7 degrees C.  The owner Mr Tashi, his son Mr. Tenzin and the staff made sure we had hot water, good food and safety, tailoring the menu to our likes, going through great risks shoveling snow to keep us safe, giving us internet and phone access to speak to our loved ones and finally arranging our safe passage from Keylong when the weather got better.  All this despite the fact that none of the guests could pay him since ATM's weren't functional and internet was too slow to make a payment. Mr Tashi even offered and also gave some guests money to make it to Manali.  Amazing.",Tourist820611,/Profile/Tourist820611,,50
lahul_spiti,"We decided to make Keylong our pit stop on our road trip from Manali to Leh and chose to spend the night at Hotel Tashi Delek.   We were given a warm welcome when we reached there and were given rooms in the new wing which were clean and spacious. They served us hot breakfast in their ethnically decorated low seating banquet room with a great view on the top floor. We were really happy with the hospitality and personalized service  of Mr. Tashi and his staff.  Food was simple, wholesome and tasty. Would highly recommend this place when in Keylong",Farida M,/Profile/Fairy70,"Mumbai, India",40
lahul_spiti,"We stayed at hotel Tashi Deleg for two days during our Keylong visit.  The hotel is situated in a prime location and our room was facing with a nice balcony from where we enjoyed the panoramic views of Keylong. Our room was in third floor of the hotel premises and the dining hall was in the ground floor. As there is no elevator so it was quite difficult to up and down more than once. The quality of food is awesome. They served us food according to our choice and each & every dishes was really praise worthy. Mr. Tashi, the owner of the hotel is a nice person and his son is also a kind heart-ed person. The staffs of the hotel are amicable and the hospitality is really impressive.",sanaser,/Profile/sanaser,Ludhiana,50
lahul_spiti,"I stayed here about 3 years ago when doing a tour in the region, and was delighted to hear that we would be staying again on this year's tour.  The room I had this time was superior to the one I had before, so that made the experience even better.  Great food.  Excellent friendly service.  Definitely recommended as the place to stay in Keylong.",Ken W,/Profile/KenW309,"Burgess Hill, United Kingdom",40
lahul_spiti,"Had a night stay here when I was on my way from Leh to Manali! The entire route was simply breath taking! We left Tso Moriri around 7.30 a.m. and reached the hotel via Sarchu and Baralach La pass, both of which are amazing, at the same time quite scary! This hotel has amazing hospitality and it's the best hotel to stay in Keylong! Attached herein is the morning view from my room! :-P",sagarmoondra,/Profile/sagarmoondra,,40
lahul_spiti,The Rooms are perfect and the restaurant is very spacious the food is truly awesome. long Region.Everything is easily accessible and located in the main Keylong Market. No need to worry because the Bus stand is approx 10 Minutes. Main Market is just along with the Hotel,Aditya Lal,/Profile/aadi17519,"Manali, India",50
lahul_spiti,A very good hotel at Keylong. Rooms have wooden flooring help to keep room warm in winter. Big and clean room. Restaurant cum Bar is very good. Just near to Keylong bus Stand. Situated on Keylong Mall road,amit8472016,/Profile/amit8472016,"New Delhi, India",40
lahul_spiti,"A reasonable hotel along the narrow street of Keylong centre town. Our delux room was in the new extension and overlooked the valley on one side and a neighbour below, sorting beans on the other side. Room is spacious with 21 m2 and a bathroom of 4.5 m2. A balcony runs along the valley-view side and serves several rooms. This hotel has actual bedsheets, which is not common for most accommodations in the region. Also: WiFi, TV, bedside tables with reading lamps and a ventilator.  In the morning you get woken up early by the sound of a hungry cow of the neighbours. Parking is available for about 8 cars. The restaurant provides Continental, Indian and Chinese food, so we had no problem getting our chili-free and curry-free dishes.  Adequate breakfast.  From here to the next",huys25,/Profile/huys25,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",30
lahul_spiti,The rooms were clean and basic. Bathroom was clean and had a working heater (yeaaaaaaaa...) Restuarant was good as was the service. Stayed one night was happy with the stay. Wifi signal is weak. There wont be much view from the rooms. But can get  good views from the roof terrance. Travelled with Royal moto touring group (who were awesome). Would stay again and recommend to others.,ARJUN V,/Profile/598arjunv,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",40
lahul_spiti,"A good place to stay in Keylong, where you will not get five star facilities any where. We had a room on the first floor in the newly built wing at the back. Our room was spacious, though sparsely furnished. The bathroom was also basic and had a drying up problem. There is no shower cubicle or bathtub, and no shampoo or moisturizer is provided. But everything is clean. A room heater was installed on our request. The room overlooks a garbage dump, but if you don't look down, and look straight or up, the view is breathtaking. The small restaurant is lovely and the food excellent. The manager is very knowledgeable about the local area and customs and he took us to the roof to point out the peak which is known as the Lady Of Keylong. The hotel is undergoing extension and renovation",Sumita62,/Profile/Sumita62,New Delhi,50
lahul_spiti,We stayed here for two nights on our way from Leh to Manali by bicycle. The service was excellent and we would like to have stayed for longer. We had a room overlooking the valley with a spectacular view to the surrounding mountains. The restaurant is great and the food some of the best we had on route. Highly recommended.,Ric H,/Profile/RicH991,"Southern Wales, United Kingdom",50
lahul_spiti,"Comfortable enough and convenient. Very good value for money. The wood panelled restaurant with lots of memorabilia had a cozy atmosphere and the food was very good. the service was very pleasant, luckily we made our own entertainment!",linglese,/Profile/linglese,"Fermo, Italy",40
lahul_spiti,"Again being a part of the Himalayan Rally, we had 2 nights here. The rooms aren't anything great to write about. Just big rooms, because this is an old hotel. The food in the restaurant was good. The service is also decent. Thats about it. But then, Keylong doesn't have a great many options. Have been to other places as well, all are the same.",Ashish B,/Profile/abudhia,"Ranchi, India",30
lahul_spiti,I spoke to the hotel for making a booking in June. However the staff sounded very rude as if they are already expecting a great rush in the season & hence least bothered about such a advance booking. No no from my end. I have not traveled but giving my experiecne for booking the same on phone. May be i am wrong about the staff as i had only telephonic discussion. Marking march 2015 as my travel date since it is not allowing me to post this review.,Jalwa84,/Profile/jalwa84,"Mumbai, India",10
lahul_spiti,"The Tashi Delek hotel is maybe the best in Keylong, a tiny village on the way to Leh. No frills but clean and comfortable. The manager is helpful and there's a good restaurant. Last but not least there is a big and safe parking for motorbikes.",Marco B,/Profile/34MarcoB,"Turin, Italy",40
lahul_spiti,"This is a fantastic family-owned-and-managed hotel in Keylong. An excellent restaurant with good food, and personalized attention from the owner and his wife, this hotel is well located too.  The room was clean, well-lit and very spacious. We stayed in the new wing.  An excellent view of the valley and the trails to the Gompas are available from the balcony. If you are self-driving, the place affords good parking facilities.  Located at the heart of the market place, a good wifi store across the road makes this a a great place to stay in and be connected despite being in the wilderness.  Butler bells in each room gives a touch of luxury!  Hot water with both solar and local geyser installations permits a hot water bath round the clock.",RoadwarriorS25,/Profile/RoadwarriorS25,"Mumbai, India",50
lahul_spiti,It is situated in the maon market in Keylong and has a good parking space. the rooms are pretty average. Definitely not value for money. The restaurant is ok but again the food costs more than it is worth.,palsd,/Profile/palsd,India,30
lahul_spiti,Rooms are in very sad condition and prices are quite high for what you get. The best I could negotiate was 1800 INR on the second top floor or 2500 on the top floor. Poor value for money given the threadbare carpets and unpleasant bathrooms. I decided to stay at the Dupchen Inn up on the main highway near the Chandera Bhaga hotel: newer and only 1200 INR for the room (although in terms of quality probably about the same.... There just seems to be no decent hotels available in Keylong). ,KGB777,/Profile/KGB777,"Singapore, Singapore",20
lahul_spiti,"Stayed for a night at Tashi Deleg Hotel in Keylong. It is conveniently located in the main street down Keylong Town. Has a big parking so if you have a vehicle you can heave a sigh of relief. The staff is polite and courteous. The rooms are clean and decore is average. We were given a room on the top floor and it was a five storey climb up to the room. The draw back with the room we had was that we were assaulted by the sound of the water tank filling up all night. The restaurant serves Indian, tibetan, Chinese and continental cuisine. The food is good and servingss ample. We ordered Aloo Paratha cooked in tandoor for breakfast and they came without any oil/butter and what is a paratha without oil and butter????  Definitely not value for money as the food was on the pricier side",psd2408,/Profile/psd2408,"Uttarkashi, India",40
lahul_spiti,"Stayed in this hotel for a night transit while travelling from Manali to Leh. Hotel rooms are spacious , clean & well lit. We didn't find the staff very friendly, they were trying to avoid room service. Food was just average.",Sribha,/Profile/Sribha,"San Jose, California",30

lahul_spiti,"You should just disregard the other reviews- they must be astroturfing. Hotel is at best modest- just the right tinge of mould and artistically spectacular stains on sheets and the restaurant's table cloths. The restaurant is a bit like home cooking- if in fact the home owners don't know hoe to cook, and are challenged to make even an omelette. The owner will proudly try and sell you the NEW and DELUXE rooms... At double the price. As noted in a previous review, the picture of a groomed and imposing stone building- it ain't this hotel. In short, keep driving, or consider sleeping in your car. ",BuffetBuster007,/Profile/buffetbuster007,"Geneva, Switzerland",20
lahul_spiti,Having stayed here on an Enfield motor cycle  tour it offered just what we needed.

The hotel is on the main road and offers great views from its corridor common to all rooms and our Room 401. Interior & furniture is great and comfortable.

lahul_spiti,"We happened to stay here through our escorted group tour package conducted by a reputed Mumbai Tour operator. The hotel is on the Manali road and offers great views from its corridor common to all rooms. Interior & furniture is not so great. It offers basic needs - hot water, carpets, electricity and good food. Decor and hygiene level is average. Mineral water is sold little expensive. Staircase of the building has high risers thus making it tiring. Do not expect luxury. Just acceptable for a 1N stay as a transit accommodation.",APatki,/Profile/APatki,"Mumbai, India",30
lahul_spiti,"Firstly, the pictures posted on this review are NOT of the Tasji Delek Hotel in Keylong, Himachal Pradesh, India - there appears to be confusion with a hotel of the same name in Sikkim. I was misled by the reviews here, and am posting pictures of what the hotel in KEELING looks like.  Now my review - rooms are FILTHY. We cannot comprehend any of the so called good reviews here which misled us, and led to the worst hotel experience of our lives. Are they talking about the same Hotel Tashi Delek in Keylong???? Please read my review, see the pictures and judge for yourself.  The toilet had excreta (poop and urine) lying around. When this disgrace was pointed out to Mr. Tashi he became defensive and argumentative and accused us of creating this atrocity.

It is basic transit hotel with hotel water,dining room etc. Some of the photos posted with red colour suites are misleading as those belong to Tashi Delek in Gangtok.

lahul_spiti,"Hotel Tashi Deleg is the best hotel in Keylong, a  place which is off the beaten track (on the Manali - Leh route). The hotel is very basic, but the rooms are clean, the bathrooms have hot water, there is a small TV and the service is simple and good. Although the food was not great (nothing local available, all north Indian Punjabi food!!), with some incidences of stale bread during breakfast, it is a decent place to stay. At Rs. 800 for a ensuite room, it may be cheaper than outside, but may be the highest charging hotel in this small town (village, really).",cajithk,/Profile/cajithk,"Kochi (Cochin), India",30

Water pressure is fine and hot water tank is a good size but the hot water flow from the tank is very weak. No phone, heat, or A/C. TV works. I had a corner room which let in a lot of light during the day and with ample space for seating and for placing luggage. Meals were good.",Paul K,/Profile/go2places,California,30
