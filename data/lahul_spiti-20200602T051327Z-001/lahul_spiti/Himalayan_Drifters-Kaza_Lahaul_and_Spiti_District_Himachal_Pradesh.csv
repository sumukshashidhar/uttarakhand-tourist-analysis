lahul_spiti,"The place has decent rooms and amenities.The cook was good too.The biggest disappointment was behaviour of the caretaker(Vipin) who was very rude from the beginning of the trip. When we had to checkout he created bills with random figures.He  even was adding charges for salt and sugar consumed (ridiculous). He never told earlier what is chargeable extra and in the end added up things none charges for. On questioning this unethical behaviour,he started shouting and was abusive. Worst hospitality ever experienced. So please beware before going there. Entire Spiti stay,this was the worst experience because of this one person named Vipin.",PS venture,/Profile/Sukreet25,,20
