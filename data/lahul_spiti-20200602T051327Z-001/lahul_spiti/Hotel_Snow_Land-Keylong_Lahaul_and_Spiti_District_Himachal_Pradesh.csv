lahul_spiti,"It's absolutely disgusting. Actually, it's the worst place I stayed in, in two+ months in India. The place looked like it hadn't been cleaned in 15 years. Loads of bugs in the room.   Also, it was very noisy, with a room service bell that you can hear everywhere in the rooms downstairs.  Just. Don't. Book. Here.",Rinke B,/Profile/654rinkeb,,10
lahul_spiti,"There's not many places to stay in this pitstop town and if you happen to arrive late afternoon you might end up having to stay here. That should be the only reason. The facilities are old and unkept, and cleaning is not exactly in their vocabulary. Some rooms have weird noises that disturb your sleep and you'll be happy when it's 6am and you can catch a bus out of here.  ",Dania,/Profile/dandu89,"San Onofre, Colombia",20

lahul_spiti,"The room was very noisy,the restaurant is located above the rooms and as a result we couldn't sleep till 1 am. We asked for a laundry and the final price for 1 laudry was 1650rupies. There are much better places where to stay in keylong.",ele0n0rad,/Profile/ele0n0rad,Italy,10
lahul_spiti,"Stayed 5 days in Hotel Snowland in Keylong on the way through to Leh. Room prices range 500rp-1000rp, nicer big rooms 800rp. During our stay we ate at the associated restaurant which was excellent food and priced with affordable prices - this was good as it kept the overall cost during our stay in Keylong low. The hotel has free wifi which you can use - works best in restaurant or near foyer. The management are friendly and helpful with arranging anything that you may need or recommending local sights. We were especially thankful that the hotel let us store our luggage for 15days or so while we were in Leh which let us travel much lighter, on returning everything was accounted for and well looked after. Would recommend this hotel for anyone stopping through",—————,/Profile/X512UBsebastians,"Brisbane, Australia",50
lahul_spiti,"Had to stay for a night as the the hotel of my first choice had no vacancy and they had a tie up with this one. Not a pleasant experience at all! Room was run down, Staff limited and looked overworked.Bathroom was in  terrible condition..in fact decided to skip a bath and wait for the other hotel.Had two meals...dinner and breakfast..both I must say were bad.To add to the discomfort were the people in the adjoining room...loud,uncouth to say the least. But to the credit of the Manager, he did speak to them.Overall, was glad to leave early next morning for a trip to Baralacha La and explore other areas of Keylong!",voayger10,/Profile/voayger10,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",20
lahul_spiti,"Interesting little village set on a steep hillside in a steep valley. Hotel looks ok on arrival... rooms not to bad on first sight - but the beds were worse than concrete! We raided all the other rooms to grab quilts to try and create a mattress..... Friendly, helpful manager tried to assist. Restaurant pleasant but food a bit avarage.",Bob M,/Profile/KIWIBOB,Wellington,20
lahul_spiti,"I knew the Hotel was going to be basic but I had been a bit spoilt previously on my way from Amristar, Dharamsharla and Manali with better Hotels. The room was very dark, there were no lights when I arrived, and I did have a 2"" centipede thingy in the wash basin that kept trying to get out to me. The shower arrangement was ancient although it is not uncommon in India, water was nice and hot. TV unwatchable!! Breakfast was ok, baked beans on toast for me, and the staff were very friendly. I wouldn't choose this Hotel again, but it is useful if travelling through. Village very primitive  but quite quaint, can't say the locals were that friendly.Good views from the rooms.",jools011,/Profile/jools011,"Pulborough, United Kingdom",20
lahul_spiti,"* Room was spacious with basic amenities like hot water / TV / room service. * Good view of mountains from the room I have checked-in.  * They have a small restaurent next to the parking space, food was ok. I have ordered roti & aloo jeera. * Hotel staff were very friendly incl Mr. Nawang who is the owner of the hotel. * I have paid Rs. 900 for a night halt from evening 1800hrs to next day morning 0700hrs incl dinner & breakfast.  I suggest that, this is one of the best hotel to stay if you are looking for a night halt.",Pavan Kumar P,/Profile/125pavankumarp,"Tampa, Florida",40
lahul_spiti,"The room looked old, tired and dirty. The linens and bathroom was also dirty. There was hot water and tv. No smoke detectors or any kind of safety information in the hotel.  The staff was friendly and helpful. ",HegeNF,/Profile/HegeNF,,20
lahul_spiti,"We were driving from Manali to Leh and due to a severe traffic jam ( 6 hours ) on Rohtang La we decided to stay in Keylong instead of Jispa. We found Hotel snowland by chance, as we could not get rooms in Hotel Chandrabhaga (HPTDC).   The hotel is situated inside the town, next to the DC's residence. The drive to the hotel is a little winding and narrow. The hotel may have around 30 rooms in three floors. There are no lifts but the enthusiastic hotel staff carries it up. The place seems to be popular with the Leh_manali trippers since a motor cycle group of twenty riders from Bangalore was also there.  The rooms are basic but with all the amenities ( hot water, good toilets ) and warm bedding.  But the best part was the restaurant - It was excellent - We had asked for local",ShyamSG,/Profile/ShyamSG,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",30
