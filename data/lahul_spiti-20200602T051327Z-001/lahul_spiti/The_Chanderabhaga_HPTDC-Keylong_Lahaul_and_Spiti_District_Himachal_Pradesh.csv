I stayed here overnight and accommodation was provided by HPTDC bus from Manali to Leh.  I upgraded from doromitory to deluxe room so don't have to stay with 4 people. I had to pay 900 rupees extra for this.  Also clerk or administrator did not provided me receipt and when I asked him for reciept he said you don't need it.!!  I again asked him for receipt and he eventually provided me.!!  So now you understand which it required maintenance.  Bad quality matteress and linen. Even towel was dirty.   Room Carpet was very bad. Even TV was not working.  Provided food which was OK.",kenpat123,/Profile/kenpat123,"sanfrancisco,ca",20
lahul_spiti,"The hotel is huge, but room amenities were not as expected. First thing that disappointed me was slim windows that obstruct a great view outside, even after getting a room at the third floor.  Secondly they do not have dedicated chef to prepare on the go anything if you don't reach in time for lunch. Sadly we were a little late and a lot hungry. The buffet dinner wasn't bad, hot soup was definitely what we wanted on a cold night.

lahul_spiti,The hotel is located in Kaylong on Manali - Leh highway. It would be a perfect stop for travellers going to Leh from Manali. During the peak tourist season you may not get a room; so I would suggest you to book it in advance. The hotel is moderately priced. We were 4 guys so we did go for a room with 2 double beds. The room had great views from 2 sides. Be careful while opening the windows as the room can get really chill in cold weather. If you are on economical trip; you may also want to opt for dormitory.  The food here is amazing. We were dying to get good north Indian food as we did not get any during our entire journey /duration of 12 days. The food was finger inking good and we enjoyed every meal we had there. Rooms were spacious and comfortable with regular supply of Hot,Saurabh G,/Profile/saurabhg947,"New Delhi, India",40
lahul_spiti,"The hotel is located on the main road in Keylong town and you will have a good view of the hills from the hotel room. Further, if you walk down a bit towards the city side, you may see the Keylong Lady - an image created on the hills by the reflection of the Sun during sunset on a clear day. We had a glace of the same. The room (family room) we occupied was big and the arrangements were good but it requires proper cleaning and maintenance. I am not sure if the quilts and warm blankets are washed on regular basis or not. The staff are very nice. The hotel is mainly used by Tourism Dept. for overnight stay of passengers travelling on the bus from Leh to Manali.

lahul_spiti,"We stayed here as part of the Manali - Leh HPTDC package. The rooms included in our package were behind the main building and were offered on sharing basis. So we decided to upgrade to the room in the main building by paying 850 rupees for a couple.   The hotel building looks great from outside. But its just about average from the inside. The bedroom feels damp, the lights are too dull, the blankets are not changed and a TV that does not work. But you do get most of the things that you need. A welcome tea, Anytime hot water, A good bed, private bathroom and amazing views of Keylong and the mountains from the room.  The food was not really good and there's no menu to chose what you want.   Overall, its a very average hotel.

The lack of maintenance is clear from the minute you drive into the parking lot and walk up the steps.   We were greeted by a very unfriendly man on the desk, who proceeded to tell us that even though they had rooms available he could get us a room without a booking.  He was about as helpful as a dead toad telling us yes they had rooms available but he wouldn't help us because we didn't have a booking and offered no other information.

The rooms were big but gloomy. Maintenance was very much lacking. The toilet was just okay.     A heater was provided which hardly did its job. So after sunset, the room became cold and depressing.     The staff, especially the manager was friendly and helpful. Food was buffet but we found the food to be very good.

lahul_spiti,"Only positive about this hotel is the location. Food: Bad with limited choices. Also, don't know if they have special love for the bowls for food. One has to repeatedly ask for bowls to put dal, etc in.  Service: Decent, but since there is only buffet option, difficult to comment.  Room: All kind of insects can be found in the hotel. I understand that it is open only for 5 months, but dirty rooms cannot be an excuse for anything. My friends room was full of spiders and my toilet has all kind of bugs appearing suddenly at nite.  Stay only if you have no other option. Probably the only HPTDC hotel that I have been disappointed in after being to many of them.",VJ81,/Profile/VJ81,Gurgaon,20

I personally find staff of the hotel including manager mr Bhatia very warm and hospitable in nature. The hotel also provide complementary breakfast and dinner for its guests and believe me, food was awesome.

lahul_spiti,"A family of 4, we stayed for one night at the Chandrabhaga Hotel, en route to Leh. Like most State Tourist Authority run hotels in Himachal Pradesh, it is large and very institutional in layout and decor. We chose it primarily in order to catch the de-luxe bus from Manali on to Leh which overnights here and leaves at 4 am. Our family suite was adequate, but not luxurious. The rooms were clean, but rather run-down and tired looking; there was  junk piled up in the corridors and public rooms, and the whole hotel is in urgent need of a comprehensive re-decoration.

We had two options: Rs 1600 only the bus fare and Rs 2200 includes bus fare and tented accommodation + dinner + breakfast at a hotel of HPTDC at Keylong. As the first time traveller on that route, we decided to take the latter option.  When we arrived there, we found that the tents have 5 beds and need to be shared with other passengers like a dormitory. There was no toilet near the tents. The toilet near the dinning hall was bad. No shower facility. They allocated us to use only one toilet on a room for shower and other use. One toilet for around 10 people. Some of the sheets and beds are very dirty.

The dinner and breakfast was also decent. When we checked in at 5PM, the hotel was almost empty but by night, it was half occupied with lots of tourists, specially foreigners.

Rarely have I come across such a person working in a Govt property who makes it a point to talk to guests and readily provide help as well as information.

The buffet dinner was nice and allowed us to chat with other passengers on the HPTDC bus, but the packed breakfast was oily and not nutritious.

The fact that it is not inside the town does mean that one requires a vehicle to get around and there is not much to do if one is not in the mood for taking out the vehicle. Staff are very helpful and responsive, although the food could have been better. The only negatives are that they do not have power backup, and also that the cost is a bit steep at Rs. 1600+tax for a double room - this includes breakfast and dinner (veg).
