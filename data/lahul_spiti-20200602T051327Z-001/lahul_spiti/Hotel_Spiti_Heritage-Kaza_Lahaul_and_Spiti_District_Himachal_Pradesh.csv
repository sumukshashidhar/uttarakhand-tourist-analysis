lahul_spiti,"worst hospitality, worst cleanliness and worst food in our twelve-day Spiti-Kinnaur trip. We booked this place because we thought the views will be great and it will be close to the river. But sadly, the place was dirty, and unclean. The TV did not work properly (not that I ever thought I would watch that, but the world cup was going on and everything else was so pathetic). The reception was clueless and rude at the same time. They took more than an hour to check us in, and then gave a small room, inspite of having paid for the highest category of rooms. We had to stay because we had already paid for the rooms. It was a RIP OFF.
