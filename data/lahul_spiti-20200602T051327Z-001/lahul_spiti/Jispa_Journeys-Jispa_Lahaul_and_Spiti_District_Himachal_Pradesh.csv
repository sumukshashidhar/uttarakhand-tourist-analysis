lahul_spiti,The tents aren't clean and lack basic things like a wash basin. The location is great and the food is tasty as well. The service however is lagging. There is scope for huge improvements. Cleanliness inside the tents is an issue here as most tents were dirty and the washrooms filthy.,parashmitra,/Profile/parashmitra,"Mumbai, India",30
lahul_spiti,Jispa Journeys is located off the highway (therefore no noise and dust). The camp has picturesque surroundings; one could take a stroll towards the river in the evening to explore dandelions and weathered rock formations. The staff is friendly and the food is decent!,LovishTekwani,/Profile/LovishTekwani,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",50

lahul_spiti,"We took a halt at Jispa while on our way from Manali to Leh. It was one of the best camps we stayed during our journey. The camp takes care of the basic necessities. What makes it the apt place to stay is that it it located right near the river surrounded by snow clad mountains. Perfect place to sit, be with yourself and read a book. The night view of the camp is simply stunning. Place is highly recommended for all those who plan to take a halt or stay at Jispa.",Tejaldaftary,/Profile/Tejaldaftary,"Mumbai, India",40
lahul_spiti,"I visited the camps in July of 2011 with 5 of my friends. Though we got delayed by 1 day due to block at Rohtang, but the staff accommodated us with a smile. The camps are located right on the banks of river, which adds icing on the cake to their Hospitality. Overall the camps are neat & clean with availability of running water in Toilets. The owner Sherab is too Courteous to make your stay one of the best during the whole trip. A must visit place.

lahul_spiti,We just stayed at the Jispa Journeys camp with my six friends and we found it was really a Epitome of service and hospitality. We stayed one night in  Jispa Journey camp  but we saw the camp site on the banks of the river and we just decided to stay there. We felt the food was tastier and the kitchen was cleaner. The Camp Owner Mr Tenzin is  lovely and very helpful he organised buffet dinner with music in the mid night .The missed that night .Keep it up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Ashok V,/Profile/Hidimba,,50
lahul_spiti,"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY FOR DRIVERS. Driver was blind drunk. We had to re-organise (and re-pay for) our onward journey from Jispa. Manager and business owner refused to believe he was drunk, even though he was drinking in front of us all whilst sitting in the minibus, and we had to hitch hike on the road for a sober lift. Absolute disgrace.  On the first morning our driver from Jispa Journeys showed up an hour late smelling strongly of alcohol. The first hour or so of driving was awful until he sobered up. We stopped several times on the way, for no apparent reason (presumably because his hangover was terrible), making what should have been a 6 hour journey take 9.5 hours.   We stopped in Keylong (less than 30 minutes from the camp at Jispa), for over an hour to the annoyance of",rdm90,/Profile/rdm90,"London, United Kingdom",10
lahul_spiti,"We just stayed at the Jispa Journeys campsite and it was a spontaneous stopover. We stayed one night in Sarchu and were going to spend the next night in Keylong but we saw the campsite on the banks of the river and we just decided to stay. So glad we did. It cost half of what we payed for our campsite in Sarchu and I felt the food was tastier and the kitchen was cleaner. The guys that run the place were lovely and very helpful. They have a potato and green bean garden that they harvest every season. The site is run really well, the chai is spiced well and the location is peaceful and relaxing.  I would recommend this over a stay in Sarchu or Keylong.",Jen B,/Profile/JenBSF,"Ubud, Indonesia",40
lahul_spiti,"We read lot of things about JISPA journeys over internet. When we started our journey from Manali to LEH first we decided to stay at Sarchu but when we saw location of JISPA camp we decided to stay back at the camp instead for continuing journey to Sarchu.   Frankly speaking this campsite is awesome. It is situated on river bed hardly 15-20 meters walking distance surrounded by mountains & clouds.   Tents were clean and washroom is ok but good facility in the middle of nowhere. Dont expect any thing great so you need to adjust your expectation as compared to some city hotel.    Staying in tent, enjoying bonfire in the evening, having couple drink in cold outside it altogether different experience.  Overall great location, good service and best place to stay.",Nchaitanya,/Profile/Nchaitanya,"Madikeri, India",40
lahul_spiti,"Jispa journeys was picked for us as the place we will spend the night on our way from leh to Manali. The place was a bit confusing to find as we had to drive beyond the town of Jispa and another small village to get here.   This is a camp in the middle of nowhere and hence you MUST adjust your expectations accordingly. The tents were clean enough, rest room was alright. Since, we were three, they arranged another bed very quickly. The bed sheets and the lot was clean and kept us warm. There is one light bulb in the tent. We were told we will get hot water in the morning but we left way too early to try it out. The staff could be a bit more attentive (for example, One of them was pretty much always on the phone and when he actually spoke to us, he was asking for cigarettes...",Sheshagiri S,/Profile/sheshagiris2016,"Santa Clara, California",40
lahul_spiti,"While a lot of friends and tour operators suggested we halt at Keylong on our way from Manali to Leh, we really found that Keylong neither had the scenic beauty nor the great campsites that Jispa had. After staying here, we really wondered why anyone would recommend Keylong over Jispa.  And the campsite at Jispa Journeys is just beautiful. The location maybe a lil off the road, but nothing that your SUV cant take. It's very close to the river, and has stunning views of the mountains around. Each tent has an attached loo which is a luxury here.   Special mention to the the boys who run the place. They were really sweet and eager to help us with whatever we needed. If you feel that Manali-Sarchu is too brutal a journey for just a day (which it is), Jispa is the place to stop at!",SimChan,/Profile/SimChan,"Mumbai, India",40
lahul_spiti,"This is by far one of my most preferred stays ever!  We were to reach this place in the morning by late noon and stay for the day and night before proceeding to Tso Moriri. But, as nature would have it, we got stuck in a landslide (another story altogether) and only reached Jispa on the next morning at 9 (it was the day we were supposed to depart for Leh). The owners.staff amazing. They were the best staff I've known, Although our stay had lapsed, they let us stay for the day/rest as long as we wanted and proceed for our next stop. They provided us with lunch (we had only paid for breakfast) and it was good homemade lunch and offered us home brewed beer. Woww! Awesome hospitality.  Now, let me the come the location.

lahul_spiti,"Have stayed here twice in 2008 & 2010.  It was while going to leh, we stumbled upon these Jispa Tents & we decided that while returing we will definately stay here. Had we known about this tented accomodation, we wouldn't have spent the earlier night in a hotel in Keylong. It was quite nice with clean blankets & bed, which  we were quite concerned in the begining. I recall the options ranged from from Rs 800 to Rs 1300 (prices in 2009) depending upon the type of tent & facilites, including all meals thrown in.  It is far better option than the overpriced Ibex at Jispa & offers a far better view & even better than some of the Swiss Cottage tents in Sarchu. The best thing is all tents are brand new & run the travel enthusiast, not typical business oriented people.  In my typical",ashagl,/Profile/ashagl,Surat,40
