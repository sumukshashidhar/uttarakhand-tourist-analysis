lahul_spiti,"Due to heavy rain and snowfall stayed longer than expected, 6 nights in total.  After 1 night somewhere else we found this place. Just renovated, clean rooms, warm shower.  Most important is the staff! They are super helpful and make this place awesome. Nothing is more relaxing than a having a drink in the sun and whaching the beautiful view on their rooftop!  Thanks Kay Cee!  Greets from Holland ;)    ",M1KEV,/Profile/M1KEV,"Murter, Croatia",50

lahul_spiti,The location is very nice. The cleanliness of the hotel is also excellent. The staff and management is the most reliable and trusted and always ready to help you for any inconvenience. It will be memorable for you if you stay there. The food is also very nice and prepared as per the requirement of the guest. Better choose the rooms at first floor or second floor.,kschouhan,/Profile/kschouhan,"Jaipur, India",40
lahul_spiti,"The best thing about this property is the personal attention provided by the owner - Jamaica. Every guest is made to feel special. :)  If you are looking for a budget accommodation with nice, cosy, clean rooms, and good food, this is the place to be. Very friendly owner and courteous staff. We spent 4 nights here and the staff and owner kind of became a family! Nothing to complain about.  The rooftop provides a good place to capture the clear night sky in the backdrop of the Kaza Monastry.",Neeraj Sinha,/Profile/NeerajSinha,"Mumbai, India",50
lahul_spiti,"A new property, the owner takes a personal interest in your comfort.  Basic but clean rooms, with hardworking, dedicated staffs. The rooms also have geysers,  and the carpets are clean (read: less smelly)  Nice view of the Spiti valley from the rooftop...",Biplav,/Profile/Biplav,"New Delhi, India",40
