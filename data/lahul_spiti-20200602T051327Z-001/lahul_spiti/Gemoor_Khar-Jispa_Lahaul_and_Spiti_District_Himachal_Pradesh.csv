lahul_spiti,"Ladakh is the real Paradise on the earth! And if you wanna visit it truly, you have to drive/ride by road. If you directly Fly to Leh and try to enjoy it, it’s like directly having children without.. :-)) Further, I feel, in comparison driving via Manali is more challenging but that is why, it’s more scenic and adventurous. So, when we drove from Manali to Jispa, we were looking for a place for just a Night halt and when I saw the page of Gemoor Khar and I booked it with lots of questions in my mind. As, looking at the photos it definitely looks the best property in Jispa. But, it doesn’t have those many votes/write ups etc. But, when we actually arrived there, we got all the answers. Its a property owned by one of the Ex rulers of that region and has heritage value! The owners",AvadhootGupte,/Profile/AvadhootGupte,"Mumbai, India",50
lahul_spiti,"I stayed here for 3 night & 4 days with my family of 10 members and its home away from home. Marvelous place to stay if you want peace of mind. Food was awesome. Hosts are really good. Got the opportunity to spent time with owners of this Home stay and i cant explain how down to earth they are. Scenic beauty, river, passes what all u need. If get an opportunity in life to visit Ladakh, will definitely & undoubtedly stay at Gemoor Khar",Kamal Kumar,/Profile/kamal2318,,50
lahul_spiti,"For exploring Lahaul we stayed 4 days at Gemoor Khar and were very pleased of our choice. Valley is a destination itself, and this is a perfect guesthouse where to enjoy hospitality after hiking. People there are very kind and happy to share ideas of sightseeing around. This is a place with story, family owns it in many generations. In the well designed dining room description and pictures on the walls are telling this history,  there is also a small library.The stuff are very helpful, tasty meals made from locally grown vegetables. Our room was new, very clean and fresh.",Maija,/Profile/Maija3,"Jurmala, Latvia",50

lahul_spiti,"We stayed at Gemoor Khar on our road trip to Leh. We are so glad we found Gemoor Khar as it was a wonderful start to our Ladakh road trip. Gemoor is a beautiful village just short of Jispa. The guesthouse has the most beautiful views and is right on the main road so very convenient stop. The staff are so helpful and so warm. The rooms are huge, spotless with clean white linen. There’s a hot water kettle with tea and coffee etc in the room. The views are amazing and sitting in their garden sipping tea and soaking in the views were the highlight. The food is simple home cooked and in a communal sort of dining room with low Ladakhi tables... we loved it. We got a chance to interact with the owners who are a lovely classy couple full of warmth and ready to share local information",JahrePollux,/Profile/JahrePollux,"Chandigarh, India",50
lahul_spiti,"The drive between Leh and Manali is amazing, but it isn't easy. By the time you reach Jispa you are quite exhausted, and what a surprise to find this great place, to get such a kind welcome, and a very good meal.  We stayed in a fully renovated part, the rooms were new, with all the comforts required. The owner was very kind and generous and the meals were great. What else can you ask for after a long and adventurous drive? Quite positive this is one of the best places to stay on your journey.",Dan G,/Profile/dangR5652NJ,"Tel Aviv, Israel",50
lahul_spiti,This is a heritage property located approximately 2-3 KM from Jispa. This property has two parts. One part is old (Heritage) which was once owned by the Diwan of Lahaul region and family still owns it. This family has a legacy of 2-3 generations of army officers. This building has kitchen and dining hall on the ground floor and food is served here only. Dining hall is very beautifully decorated with a lot of family photos and has a small library to choose a book if you love to read. This building has the best view of the river which you can enjoy from the small lawn outside but no rooms here. First floor of this building is still reserved for the family which still comes here sometimes and resides.  Second part of the property is a newer one which is built recently for the,Prashant Kumar,/Profile/prashantk0505,"Noida, India",40
