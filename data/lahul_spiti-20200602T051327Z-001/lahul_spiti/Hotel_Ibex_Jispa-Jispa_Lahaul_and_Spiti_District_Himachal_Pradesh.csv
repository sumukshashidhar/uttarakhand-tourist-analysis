lahul_spiti,"Good Stopover while travelling from Manali to Leh.  It is around 5 hours from Manali, rooms are clean. The hotel is right on the Highway overlooking the river offering a very good valley view  This place being a hotel is quite warm and  is better stop compared Sarachu Camps. Also at 3300m, helps you in acclaimatizing with high altitude. You can also take 5 mins walk down to the river to get better view of the valley The Hotel serves buffet dinner having both veg and non-veg items and in breakfast it serves Corn flakes, bread, omelette and alu paranthe with tea or coffee. The food is very tastey and hygienic. It is value for money.",CHANDRA N,/Profile/297chandran,"New Delhi, India",40
lahul_spiti,It seems one of the first hotel that came up in the Jispa region. It is located right on the road connecting Leh to Manali and should not difficult to locate. The property is also quite close to the flowing river. You can take a nice stroll in the area during the evening. It is pretty old styled with wood being used in ample quantity for interiors. Its not about wood being used but how the wood is being used. Remember the decor we used to see in hotels in 90's. The bathroom is also old styled with white square shaped tiles. Hence I would suggest this hotel to go for a major facelift by renovation.  The stay is however comfortable. Hot water was available 24x7 during our stay in July. The breakfast and dinner is served with quite a lot of options to choose from. It was also the,vabhatia,/Profile/vabhatia,"New Delhi, India",40

lahul_spiti,"A simple hotel where you can relax, recover and then rejuvenate for the onward journey to Leh!! The river flows right infront while the hill range is right behind you... a laid back town with a few hundred souls living there ... service is excellent and in that atmosphere, beleive me, everything tastes good!!",Prashanth A,/Profile/prashantha100,"Diu, India",50
lahul_spiti,Stayed here for a night. Preferable over sarchu as suggested by the driver as the climate doesn't suit for most of the people. It was worth it. Ibex hotel is a nice place. Hospitality is good. Rooms are neat and  clean at a reasonable price. If you are staying insist for a river view room in any floor. You get a very nice view of the Chandra river. We spent a lot of time on the banks of Chandra River. Nice 2 km walk would give you a great sigh of relief after travelling for the whole day in the steep mountains.,Srinivas R,/Profile/389srinivask,"Visakhapatnam (Vizag), India",40
lahul_spiti,"On our road trip from manali to Leh, after crossing Keylong, we took a night halt at Jispa instead of driving upto Sarchu. Jispa is a beautiful valley around 6 hours from Manali with the scenic chandra river flowing through it. The Ibex Hotel, situated right on the highway, is a good property overlooking the valley and river. The rooms were adequate and clean. The food was served hot and was quite edible, considering you can't expect much in such remote areas of ladakh. We spent a lovely afternoon walking down the road to the monastery and the river. The stark mountains of Ladakh in this area are spell binding and offers unlimited photo ops.",Priya_Manore,/Profile/Priya_Manore,"Kullu, India",40
lahul_spiti,Its a decent place to stay while on your journey from manali to leh. Nothing fancy about the place. Has all the basic amenities that one needs. Only drawback is there is no regular supply of hot water to the rooms which would be helpful in such cold climate. Otherwise the food was good and the staff were also friendly and helpful. A good place to acclimatize to the high altitude also.,Pratheek Sargod,/Profile/pratheeksargod,"Chikmagalur, India",30
lahul_spiti,"stayed for a couple of nights here in summer 2011 and found it to be satisfactory, especially given where you are.   The manager was friendly and very flexible [ we decide to extend for antoher night at 6 in the morning- not a problem] .   A reliable stop enroute to Leh, and perfect as far as altitude and acclimatisation is concerned.",aierlan,/Profile/aierlan,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",30
lahul_spiti,"Stayed at the hotel jispa in may 2010 , as part of a 20+ motorbike touring group , having struggled to get over the Rotang pass , it was a relief to arrive at the hotel , everyone was cold , wet etc. The rooms were allocated quickly , and off we went in to the COLDEST room , l have every been in. There is NO heating in this hotel at all , and we had to sleep fully clothed under the blankets to keep warm at night. The staff would not supply any heaters ... Our biking gear wasstill wet and cold when we set off 2 days later. Food was average but the same every night  and was cold by the time you got back to the table.",merdalf,/Profile/merdalf,"Herne Bay, United Kingdom",10
lahul_spiti,"Good Stopover while travelling from Manali to Sarchu. If you are not in hurry to get to Sarchu in 1 day then this is a good stop place.  It is around 5-6 hours from Manali, rooms are clean, offer good valley view and food is served warm. This place is better stop compared to Keylong for the views it offers. Also at 3300m, helps you in acclaimatizing with high altitude. You can also take 5 mins walk down to the river to get better view of the valley",godbolem,/Profile/godbolem,Bangalore,40
