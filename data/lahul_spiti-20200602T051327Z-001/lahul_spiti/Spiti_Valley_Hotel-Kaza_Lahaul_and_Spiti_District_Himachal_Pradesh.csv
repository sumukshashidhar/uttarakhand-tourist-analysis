lahul_spiti,"The owner is nice but the caretaker (who clears dictates what goes around in the hotel is a sexist and arrogant man who clearly does not deserve to be in the service industry. My experience in Kaza was ruined because of this person, who clearly did not have the decency to even apologise for his misbehaviour. There was no water in the bathroom of our hotel room and when we asked what the problem was, we were accused of keeping the water running and I was yelled at by this guy for speaking, ‘despite being a girl’. The guy was drunk and misspoke for a while. Mind you, this was going on in the late evening. We had to lock ourselves in the room to avoid further conflict in the middle of the night. Awful experience. Feel free to contact me if you would like to see the video of the",AJain,/Profile/JainAni10,,10
lahul_spiti,"The hotel was good. the location was good, rooms were good, but the staff was really rude. Food was not that great too, it was just that they were charging high and on top of it realising us that we are on their mercy. ",tusharkhandelwal,/Profile/tusharkhandelwal,"New Delhi, India",20
lahul_spiti,At the time of check in hotel owner was out of town and his cell was out of network and only he knows that we had booking. But still hotel co assistant allow us to check in. Superb hospitality they had provided.They had provided breakfast of our choices with no extra charges.They had guided us well for local sight seeing which saved our huge time.I must say if any body planning for kaza go for spiti valley hotel.,shantnu,/Profile/shaan2708,,50
lahul_spiti,"I stayed in this hotel for a couple nights with my wife. The hotel is on the main road towards the back end of the town just before the petrol pump and the monastery.  Considering the rest of the hotels in Kaza, i found this one to be decent. The rooms were spacious and the service was good. Having heating in the rooms would be nice but they were able to provide this at an additional cost. The food was good but limited options. One of the few hotels to provide wifi but very slow.",Ankush Rawat,/Profile/rawankush,,40

lahul_spiti,"I had already read about this hotel and planned to stay there during my visit to Kaza-. Firstly I had to go to the hotel and check at the reception 3 times before someone could assist and then the guy who was a little plump amwith some beard asked me to leave the hotel in Hindi when I asked him what facilities does the hotel provide.He had no reason to be rude to someone who very nicely asked him about the hotel and then when I countered him ,he forced me to leave the hotel and intimidated me. He didn't even have the balls to give his name. Yo the owners of this hotel,as good or as bad as you may be,this kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable...It leaves a bad taste and you loose business as we were 4 of us who wanted to stay there for a night and it ends up in Us writing",bishal R,/Profile/bishalR41,,10

lahul_spiti,Value for money. Proper service. Meet the expectations. Resort is facing the mountains. Totally getting a feel that we were almost in midst of dessert. For me its enough as expected . Although it was nice stay with them,Deepan1976,/Profile/Deepan1976,"Pune, India",50
lahul_spiti,"The town of Kaza is a small place....we were a bit disappointed to be at Kaza after having seen such beautiful places like dhankar, lhalung, mud village. The hotel is just beside the new monastery...the balcony offers a great view of the karakoram ranges, with snow capped peaks and the valley in between(though the snow was a bit less this year). Food is good, but a bit oily.....no local food/tea is available, even on request. You can stay for 1night at Kaza......more than that will be a bit boring.(no markets like that of leh). It is better to stay longer at Mud, or one of the village homestays near Kaza (Langza, Ke,kibber)",Natnayas,/Profile/natnayas,"Haldia, India",40
lahul_spiti,"We spent two nights here in October 2017 during our trip to Chandratal.   To be very honest, this is a small hotel without much worth mentioning. The rooms were quite small, but that seems justified considering the low rate. The food and service was actually better that we had expected.",Indranil b,/Profile/IBhattacharjee,"Kolkata, India",40
lahul_spiti,"We had a 3-night stay in Kaza and this is the place that we choose. BUt after the first night, we were really disappointed with the services and the behavior of the staff. The guy who is in charge of the things behaves like he has let you stay for free. The quality of the food was nice but when you have such cold behavior and bad service nothings makes you comfortable. We were told that the breakfast timings are up to 10:30. On the first day, we were late and we were told that everything is on time here. But where the dinner timing was up to 9:30, when we went for dinner around 9:00 after full day trekking and trips we told that you have to wait as their prioritized guests are currently having dinner. This kind of behavior is really not expected from a renowned property.",Ranak G,/Profile/ranakg,"Bangalore District, India",20

Located on the main road and opposite the monastery, rooms have balconies which allows you to soak in the views while sipping hot tea. Jamaica is an experienced person and has wealth of info - he is very helpful and has the right answers to all the things. This place is highly recommended!",BunnyPunia,/Profile/BunnyPunia,"New Delhi, India",50
lahul_spiti,I stayed at the Spiti Valley after ending a long trekking in Ladakh - Spiti. Rooms are spacious and reasonably clean as well as the bathroom. Hot water available. Towels and soap provided but not toilet paper (upon request maybe). Wi-Fi in the rooms but very slow. The hotel is on the main road (not much traffic so it is still peaceful and quiet at night) and in easy walking distance (5-10 min) from the center of the village.,Anne L,/Profile/annel795,"Niort, France",40
lahul_spiti,The rooms are quite large as per Kaza standard. The rooms are spotlessly clean. location is awesome as it is bang opposite Kaza monastery.

lahul_spiti,"We got at this hotel via Travelspiti.com. A perfect choice for our trip trough the Himalayas to Kaza, Tabo and more. They are trustworthy and a great value.   We just visited the Spiti valley and it was an amazing experience. Our guide was extremely professional and spoke great English. He showed us the most amazing places and had a ton of valuable information about the area to share with us. And he always made sure we had everything we needed!  All perfectly arranged by Jamaica. We had a tight schedule, but he arranged everything and made sure we saw everything we wanted!  The hotel was great, clean! And if you needed anything they were always very helpful!

lahul_spiti,"The rooms were basic and clean.  The restaurant food was very good.  Staff was over worked and extended, so service was terribly slow.  The hotel manager tried to scare us about our future trip to manali and kept trying to convince that we break up our journey and spend the next night at a hotel he had mid way.  We didn't pay any attention to this and we arrived at Manali safely.
