lahul_spiti,"Rooms were good, the view from the room was good, the location of the hotel was good but the staff was really pathetic. All the associates served us really in a poor way. They didn't even provide toiletries and towels to us and the food served at the restaurant was also not up to the point. We faced a problem with one of our bikes in the morning and none of the staff members were accommodating, instead they were whining about getting us checked out so that they can get the rooms back for other guests. Value for money is totally zero at this hotel. Not at all recommended. ",Murtaza A,/Profile/MurtazaA130,,30
lahul_spiti,"Dhankar village is at 3890 mtr and one can visit the same while travelling from Tabo to Kaza. Kaza is 22km from Dhankar. Dhankar earlier used to be capital of Spiti.   The village also has Dhankar Gompa at top most point. There is a new Gompa also constructed near the village entrance. Total population is around 300. It is said that due to strategic height advantage, Dhankar was made capital of Spiti.   Trekking enthusiasts can visit Dhankar Lake atop west side of the village - steep trek takes about 1-1/2 hr. View is Spiti river is awesome atop Dhankar Gompa.",Shailesh Dheman,/Profile/SHAILESHDHEMAN,"New Delhi, India",40
lahul_spiti,"We stayed overnight at Dhankar heights. The rooms were comfortable, spacious and seemed new. We had running water and geyser for hot water. Food was good and service was excellent. The view from the balcony and restaurant is lovely. Would recommend it to families and couples for the comfort and service offered. ",Jy0,/Profile/Jy0,"Bengaluru, India",40
