lahul_spiti,The Dewachen Retreat is a somewhat simple but adequate hotel where I stayed one night on my way through the Spiti Valley. I had a smallish room with big bed that was actually twin beds pushed together. The matching bedding and curtains were a nice touch and the wooden floor was warm underfoot. There were also a couple of canvas “directors” chairs and small coffee table. There was no TV in the individual rooms but there was one in the dining room. My room was at the back of the building away from the road and shared a balcony with the room next door. It was a simple matter to carry one of the light canvas chairs outside for the quiet village and mountain views while sipping an early morning cup of coffee.  The bathroom was small but complete with an individual geyser. There was,Jane E,/Profile/JaneE604,"New York City, New York",40
lahul_spiti,"This place offered us the best stay in the entire Spiti valley. We were welcomed with such hospitality, and warmth, that this place and the people will always remain in our hearts. The rooms are well appointed, with a nice balcony at the rear overlooking the Tabo monastery. The caves were simply across the narrow road infront of the retreat. Though on the main road, we loved our stay here, as the place was calm and awesome. We would surely love to go back here and stay longer the next time. The service was EXCELLENT. The dinner was fantastic, and so was the breakfast. Mr. Kedar Chettry was a great chef, and his cousin (sorry I forgot the name) Mr. Chetri took good care of us. They also asked us to stop by on the day of our return from Kaza, for a cup of tea, which we did. Thanks",Sumana D,/Profile/396sumanad,"Guwahati, India",50
lahul_spiti,Tabo is a beautiful serene quiet place and is very very small. This hotel is bang on the main road and is walking distance to the Tabo monastery and the caves. Staff is helpful and alert. Food is average. Rooms are ok and on the smaller side and bathroom was big and clean. The room had a balcony overlooking the Tabo monastery and wheat fields. However the balcony is shared and all rooms open into the same balcony so lack privacy. Would recommend the management consider building a basic partition to ensure privacy and no disturbance to anyone. ,Shital M,/Profile/ShitalM_12,,40

lahul_spiti,Stayed here for a night on our way to Kaza. This is a little place overlooking the mountains and the oldest monastery in the area. The hotel is very functional but the service was great. We reached in pretty late at night due to a landslide that delayed the traffic but the guys were waiting for us in the main entry to the village.They got us warm food and tea. Breakfast was on order and pretty decent. The also got us nice packed lunch for our onward journey to Kaza.

lahul_spiti,"When we arrived at Dewachen Retreat, Tabo, it looked like somebody's house. It had a massive, carved wooden front door that gave it a pagoda-like look. The door opened into a lounge-cum-dining area with a wooden ceiling and graceful, wooden furniture. We called out, and a staff member came out of the kitchen to check us in. Four bedrooms lined the corridor at the back of the house, with a balcony running along the outside. The balcony overlooked fields and apple orchards, with the Tabo monastery visible less than a kilometre away. The food served was local cuisine and delicious!  This is a good place to halt if you don't want to drive to Kaza in a single journey.

But it’s very comfortable n clean n cozy , with basic provision of hot water n soap n shampoo n towels. The rooms are decent size n well furnished. From the back of the hotel rooms we can see the Tabo Monastery. The front overlooks the mountain with 33 caves. The caves were used by the panda as during Mahabharata time.

It's a place I could sit for hours.  The hotel itself was OK. The room was small, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom and shower were fine.  The service was strange.  We were the only guests in the hotel and were met by two young guys who were very friendly, but not terribly helpful and certainly not professional.  We had ordered dinner in advance and they were told we are vegetarians, but they prepared chicken. Breakfast was not good, perhaps the worst breakfast we had on this trip to Himachal Pradesh.

Rooms were small, but cheerful in bright colours and well-insulated against the cold, with very clean furnishings. Pretty, embroidered cane slippers were provided for guests, as well as rubber ones for use in the bathroom. Towels and soap were also provided.   Meals were good and clean drinking water was available. The hotel also has an open terrace for sky-watching or astrophotography.

It is a fairly good property with clean rooms and washrooms. However the rooms are too small compared to its price.  Food was average and buffet dinner was served. No of items were limited.

Dewachen Retreat is located right next to monastery and you can view the monastery and the Himalayan ranges surrounding it from the back balcony of the retreat. If you step out in front you see caves.  Retreat is simple compared to its comparative hotels elsewhere, but in this Himalayan village what they provide is luxury. Hot water in your taps, freshly prepared food to help you combat high altitude and a view on both sides. The owner is an authority on Tabo and you can ask him any questions. They can arrange a knowledgable guide to take you around the village.

We experienced the kindness of strangers that helped us out throughout our trip in Spiti when the owner, Rajinderji lent us a  local SIM card that eventually ended up saving our life. The food at there was delicious and the bed linen clean. The hotel is convenient located near the Tabo Monastery and other local eateries. Even though electricity is a problem in Spiti, a solar lamp that is installed in each room proves to be adequate.   The Bad's:  The bathrooms were not cleaner than the hotels that charged much lesser than Dewachen. The hotel also fails to provide toiletries or clean towels.  At first, Dewachen seems to be a luxury in a resource-less surrounding, and one is willing to pay heavily for that",Aashna_Jain,/Profile/Aashna_Jain,"Surat, India",30

However enjoying stark landscapes of Spiti valley and splendid views of barren ochre hills with snow icing on them is going to cost you the following:  1. Though the best one in the area, since electricity is erratic and this resort does not have a genset, you can imagine what sorts of problems can crop up.  2. Be ready for no lights in rooms, no cooked food.  3. No charging for your cellphones, camera batteries etc.  4. Many food items on the menu may not be available.  5. Options for vegan are terrible.

The 6 am visit to the 1000 year old Tabo monastery to join the Lamas in their prayers makes it worth a stay. Enroute to Kaza from Tabo is the jaw dropping beautiful Dhankar Monastery. The hotel itself is nothing much, go there with limited expectations but it is the best under the circumstances, power availability is a huge challenge and the generator works in the place which is a big saving grace.
