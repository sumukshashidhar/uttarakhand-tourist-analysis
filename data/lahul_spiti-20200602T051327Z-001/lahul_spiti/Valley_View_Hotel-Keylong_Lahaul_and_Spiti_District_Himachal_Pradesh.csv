lahul_spiti,Keylong is a halt for us coming from Leh to Manali. Recommended by a friend and we stayed here.   THe owner is very friendly. There is good parking. We had dinner and the food was good as well.   Rooms are basic but again value for money and it's only a night halt. ,ramchabi,/Profile/ramchabi,"Chennai, India",40

lahul_spiti,"Mostly people land up at Keylong for a night stay, On our road trip from Leh, we halted at Keyoing for a night and reached the hotel around 8 pm. The rooms are large and quite decent for the cost we paid. Bathrooms are decent and have running hot water. Food too is quite decent and nothing to complain about. View from the room is nice overlooking the valley. Since we left again early next morning did not have any complaints and would recommend this hotel to fellow travelers.",Avijitsen,/Profile/Avijitsen,"Mumbai, India",40
lahul_spiti,This is budget hotel near the main market with basic clear rooms and hot running water. The hotel is situated at a little height from the main road and gives an awsm view of surrounding mountains. There are no TV or Wifi at the hotel which was little let down.,Gaurav S,/Profile/sharma21069,pune,40
lahul_spiti,"Calm ,scenic place . Amazing view ,affordable rates,warm helpful staff,good food and good spacious clean rooms with warm water . I had stayed here in 2013 with another 4rider friends.This time I was on a solo ride and being a lady rider I knew which place to go. The owner  is an elderly person who is very helpful .by the end of the day this room had hot water, rugs to keep me warm in the cold environment and a nice room service that offered me clear chicken soup and cheese chicken sandwiches.  Highly recommend this place. The people here are honest and true.a  big Thank you for such a positive experience!",Enfieldmaniac,/Profile/enfieldmaniac,"Mumbai, India",50
