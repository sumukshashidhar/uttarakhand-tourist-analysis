lahul_spiti,Great pit stop en route to leh from Manali.. hotel is decent with good beds and food .. best is the river right opposite and the views one gets from there. Enfield workshop also available at this place,Nikenahar,/Profile/Nikenahar,"Amritsar, India",40
lahul_spiti,"If you are traveling to Leh and need a place to spend a day or two to acclimatize and to enjoy the beauty then this is my recommendation. I loved their food. Even though its a small village hotel the food was yummy. You get real countryside hospitality and the nature around the hotel is just awesome. Oh Yeah, I almost forgot the river in front of it. It most accessible at this place.",Zeena S,/Profile/ZeenaS21,"New Delhi, India",40

lahul_spiti,"Though Jispa is used by travelers going to Leh as a night halt we decided to stay for two days. Hotel Bhaga was very affordable and to our delight we found it very amicable and it suited our needs very well.  It is a small hotel run by Mr Dawa. The staff was very friendly. We traveled to Jispa with office colleagues and I had my one year old Kid. The hotel people were very helpful in providing the necessities of the baby in a very cold condition.  Our non-veg lovers in the party were a fan of Bhaga Hotels Chicken Masala to such an extent that it was ordered twice and we requested the cook for the recipe. There were apple trees in full bloom and trekking routes 360 degrees around the hotel.  The rooms were neat, though only a few of them had electric geyser. They depend on solar",Rooturaj,/Profile/Rooturaj,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",40
lahul_spiti,"Stayed in this hotel during my journey from manali to leh as a stopover for a night. Hotel is nice and staff is helpful. They have hot running water and attached bathrooms. Rates may depend on demand and season, one can get good deal if negotiated. Rooms are big  and clean. Food was good, and Bhaga river can be heard from the rooms. Overall it was a good experience.",bytegaurav,/Profile/bytegaurav,"Bengaluru, India",50
lahul_spiti,"The better known place down the street was full so we checked out the Bhaga view. The management was friendly, the rooms clean, the plumbing worked, the water was hot. Food was standard daal bhat sabzi, etc.  Prices were negotiable; other negotiated harder but that's the game so no hard feelings. We felt safe and welcome on our bicycle tour in early July.",viralimm,/Profile/viralimm,"Seattle, Washington",40
