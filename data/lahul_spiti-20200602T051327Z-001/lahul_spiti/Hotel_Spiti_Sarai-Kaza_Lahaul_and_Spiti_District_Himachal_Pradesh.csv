lahul_spiti,The hotel has an amazing location with breath taking views.  Rooms are great with decent bathrooms.  The food especially vegetarian is a total delight.  Great service.  However service not yet well equipped to manage guest rush at same time.  But then that's the case in most places in spiti as it's a very remote place at a very high altitude with limited resources unlike leh which is more developed.  I appreciate the best services provided under limited resources.  So would recommend it as a  great stay!!!,Mitali88,/Profile/Happiness826380,,50
lahul_spiti,"Any good hotel is good because of its staff and that's what is true for Spiti Sarai. A weirdly constructed hotel but ably managed by Vijay and his team who are more than happy to help in anyway that they can.  Some of the weird things,  washroom window opens to view outside and you can see people moving around and I am assuming they can also see inside, fixed menu for breakfast, rooms with unnecessary furniture (TV corner with no TV) and to top it off the owner has constructed an ugly looking pink colouredbuilding obstructing the view to Key Monastery of the original Spiti Sarai building. However, all these deficiencies have been compensated by Vijay who is ever smiling and always willing to help you.

lahul_spiti,"Location Wise its one of the Best. However, you need to go outside to enjoy a 360 Degree view of the Mountains, as the recent constructions at this property blocks the view from the Hotel. The Staff were friendly and the food was good.  But there was no TV in the room (Which would not have been necessary if the room had an outside view).  Also, they charged enormous amount for a room heater (which should be a basic facility in a cold place like this)   Overall, the place is good.

Besides, the management is in the process of constructing these UGLY buildings within the premises which not only obstructs the view but are an major EYE SORE. Infact, one wonders, why would one want to create such ugliness in such a beautiful place!!  This place is probably used by tourist's who are booked through Spiti Expeditions as the owners are the same. The management is probably more focused on enhancing their expedition facilities rather than on the hotel.  The staff are very few, well meaning youngsters from Bihar area, not trained or educated.

The bathrooms were clean, hot water was available and the warm blankets/ quilts were adequate to counter the cold weather in the night. The food and service at Spiti Sarai was of top order. The breakfast and dinner had a very good variety. The food was neither too spicy nor too bland. Special requests were considered well. For example, for the Chinese dinner, we needed chapathi for my father in law as he is not used to that food. It was promptly prepared. Also, milk was always provided for the baby on demand.

lahul_spiti,Pros: 1) The location is both good and bad. The good part is that it is away from the hustle and bustle of both Kaza and Rangrik and you have have a quite walk out to the Spiti Valley with some excellent views of Ki monastery. 2) The staff was courteous and the food was ready in time we had requested. 3) The rooms and bathrooms are quite spacious and reasonably clean. 4) Tariff is reasonable.  Cons: 1) The food was pretty average. 2) The rooms had heave tinted glasses and you cannot see anything outside. 3) The bad part of location is that it is hard to get to from both Kaza and Rangrik and you are stuck with eating the hotel food. 4) Room fixtures are pretty poor and most of the power/light outlets don't work.,rmanoj,/Profile/rmanoj,"Pune, India",30

The rooms in the top floor are warmer. We were at the top. One can get the view of key monnestry from room. The hotel stuff were good and friendly.
