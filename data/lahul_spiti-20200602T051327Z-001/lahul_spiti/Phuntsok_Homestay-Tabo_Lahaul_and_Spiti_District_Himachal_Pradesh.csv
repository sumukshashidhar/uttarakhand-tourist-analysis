lahul_spiti,"Phuntsok’s homestay was little away (150 m) from the main road, behind Siddharth Hotel. This ensured complete serenity and provided beautiful apple orchard to look at when you open your windows. The rooms were spacious, clean. Bathroom was clean. Phuntshok’s two young children were another attraction for us. Especially, we enjoyed company of younger son Tenzin. He would open up his treasure house if you play with him. Phuntsok was a great host! As he learnt that I was interested in night sky photography he took us to the helipad for the same. He had vast knowledge on the local history. I highly recommend this ‘value for money’ place at Tabo.",kunal,/Profile/mandal_kunal,"Kolkata, India",50
