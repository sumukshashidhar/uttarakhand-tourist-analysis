They advised us on the do's and dont's(very important to get this right or your while trip is over before it starts). Food was decent knowing that the location and supplies are difficult to get.  The place overall along with the arrangements is good. Food-3.5/5 Stay-4/5 Location -4.5/5  Tip: 1.Do ask for hot water bags during night. It helps a lot. 2.stop at Sarchu.

lahul_spiti,We were travelling from leh to manali and had to take a stop over for the night at the gold drop camp. We reached in the evening on 9th july and left after breakfast the next day. Have to say its one of the best camps in sarchu. Neat and clean tents with good bathrooms. The camp lies between all the mountains so it gets freezing cold in the nights. One should be equipped with thermals. Thanks to mr vijay for being very helpful to us as we were a group of 5 family members. He did everything to make our stay comfortable. Very helpful staff too. In such cold weather to get yummy hot vegetarian food for dinner and breakfast was just great.  Would definately recommend this camp to all. It was packed with people.  Keep it up👌👌👌👌 ,Renuaan,/Profile/renuaan,,40

lahul_spiti,"You need the right attitude when you stay at Goldrop camp.  The tents are comfortable, but basic.  They go to great lengths to make your stay comfortable in this inhospitable and desolate area.   Though sheets and blankets are provided, I was more comfortable using my own  sleep-sack and  disposable pillowcase.  The staff will bring a hot water bottle at night to put in your bed; and also deliver warm washing water in the morning.  These services are on request and there may be a slight  extra charge (not sure about this - our guide arranged it).  The buffet breakfast is good and they will do eggs to order.     It is interesting to talk to other people staying at the camp - where are they going, what have they seen,etc.  This valley has several camps.

Believe me the way tents look at the pictures, they are exactly the same, but one thing that cannot be seen in the pictures is the hospitality they offer.Hospitality is outstanding, the way they treat you is superb.

lahul_spiti,The location of Sarchu is such that it is in a valley and thus temperatures dip like anything in night but this is where Goldrop Camps saves you ...

lahul_spiti,"We'd recently been to Goldrop Adventure Camps in Sarchu when we were doing a roadtrip to Leh. Since Goldrop was our travel partner who arranged our accomodations right from Manali to Leh, staying at their own camp in Sarchu was but obvious.  We started our day from the town of Jispa. Sarchu is like 90 odd kms from there. so the driving part is very less and you will not get tired. Why I am mentioning this may sound a bit surprising but read on. Note - Jispa is the last town where you would get a phone signal so if you're doing it like us, please make sure you call your loved ones because you then wouldnt get any phone network till you reach Leh.

Having said that, if your itinerary requires you to stop over in Sarchu, this is the perfect place to stay. The location is amazing in the midst of the beautiful mountains. The isolated expanse of this place is surreal. The accommodation is as good as it gets in a place like this. The tents are nice and comfortable with an attached bathroom with a flush and toilet paper.

lahul_spiti,"Staying at Sarchu is a horrible horrible experience. Please don't do it unless you absolutely need to. It's not called the vomit junction for nothing and if you do do it, spend enough time acclimatization and still be prepared to experience troubles.  Having said that, the night sky that we saw at Sarchu will be remembered by all of us for our entire lives. We saw the milky way with our naked eye for the first time in our lives and it's an experience that isnt' forgotten easily.   The accommodation itself is spectacular considering the altitude and the remoteness. We get all the basic facilities including attached restrooms.

The tents themselves have beds with warm quilts and blankets and an attached toilet with running cold water. Sometimes the smell from the toilet can get one uneasy. The food is simple but decent with nice, friendly staff. At night hot water bags are given to the guests.

It was just at the base of the mountains and across the roads you will see vast area of plain land which is ideal for photography. What's more awesome is that at the end of plain land you have river flowing down the valley. You also see long stretch of straight road which is also amazing for a few clicks.  The only thing that could have been better was the food and hence I am giving a four star.  All in all it was an amazing experience.

Having spent 4 months backpacking India, I have stayed in many guesthouses. My accommodation at Goldrop was cleaner, more comfortable & more private than anywhere else I have stayed during my trip, which blew me away considering I was staying in a tent! Goldrop Camp is a brilliant set up & I did not expect such spacious & comfortable tents. The staff are willing to go above and beyond to ensure you have a great stay.

Just when you start feeling the mountain sickness is going to take its toll, up comes a local remedy and the equipment like oxygen - to help you make it through. The food is cooked fresh and served warm almost on demand.

They committed to provide water in buckets but everyone was sleeping till late delaying our check out and onward journey.

The temperature which we witnessed along with cold winds was simply terrible. No other destination in JK or HP was so bad as Sarchu but everything comes with a cost. The canyon in sarchu was mind blowing. It's surrounded with mountains and a plain plateau along with canyon makes it one of the best place.

We were in the Goldrop camp (the one with the red tents - allegedly the best....). Well, if you are 25 and have good experiences as a boy scout, then you will find this camp acceptable. If you are 61 years like me, then not, because: 1. You sleep on terribly hard beds; 2. It is ice cold during night; 3. The ""running"" water in your tent is just dropping; 4.
