lahul_spiti,The staff was very friendly and had all info about the area nearby. The rooms wee neat and clean and quite spacious. We took a family room with terrace. My cousin got sick at night and had to be taken to hospital in kaza. The staff was very helpful in that. The food was ok but has a great view to the mountains and cliffs.,Jai G,/Profile/JaiGosar,"Mumbai, India",40
