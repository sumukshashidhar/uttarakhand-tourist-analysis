lahul_spiti,"The hotel was good. the location was good, rooms were good, but the staff was really rude. Food was not that great too, it was just that they were charging high and on top of it realising us that we are on their mercy. ",tusharkhandelwal,/Profile/tusharkhandelwal,"New Delhi, India",20
lahul_spiti,"Conveniently located near the thousand year old monastery, Siddharth is a very good hotel, considering the remoteness of Tabo in Spiti Valley of interior Himachal... stayed for a night only on way to Kaza... very clean, new linens and good food... despite being a off-season for tourists, the staff took good care for us... also got a very good deal in rent with very few occupants in the hotel.",Pradip K,/Profile/PradipK93,"Navi Mumbai, India",50
lahul_spiti,"They managed to take very good care of us despite being opened a month ago. The hotel has been renovated and it is really good. Rooms were clean, with great views and food was amazing. Staff was cooperative. Amazing location, just at a walking distance from tabo monastery. ",Scenic791381,/Profile/Scenic791381,,50
lahul_spiti,"This hotel provides all the basic amenities, along with cleanliness. Given its such a small village, I didn't expect such kind of conditions of the rooms.  Well Maintained!! Also, don't do online booking as the rates are completely absurd. Expect around 1400-1800 for a twin sharing basis room.",Vishal Maru,/Profile/iViisshhh,"Mumbai, India",50
lahul_spiti,"The Siddhartha guesthouse is a stone's throw away from the monastery. It has a terrace which is great for watching stars & constellations. Our rooms were spacious, airy & comfortable. The bathrooms were clean. The staff is minimal & non-intrusive. We only had breakfast here which was a staple affair of bread, cereals, paratha etc. There was no non vegetarian food which made us step out for our other meals. There was also no power backup.",Let's Go Sightseeing,/Profile/LetsGoSightseeing,"Noida, India",30
lahul_spiti,"The hotel is just beside the Tabo monastery. The rooms are big, warm and clean. There is a terrace in the 1st floor which is amazing. We were there on a full moon night and it was magnificent! The food is good understanding that the place is quite cut off from the big towns.",Sayantani Chatterjee,/Profile/SayantaniC,"Hyderabad, India",50
lahul_spiti,Pros: 1) The hotel is located very close to the Tabo Monastery and it is just a few minutes walk to get there. 2) The rooms and bath rooms are clean and spacious. The hotel is one of the better ones in the town. 3) The view from the terrace is very good.  4) Tariff is reasonable. 5) The food was excellent was served on time. 6) The staff was quite courteous.  Cons: 1) Tabo is quite bad when it comes to power cuts. There is generally no power supply till 6 pm and even after that it is quite unstable. The hotel should have had a backup of some sort.,rmanoj,/Profile/rmanoj,"Pune, India",40
lahul_spiti,"The hotel is located close to the temple complex of Tabo and staff is friendly. However, we had a really dirty room (the bedsheets were horrible) and it was noisy due to cars arriving and leaving directly in front of our room.",3silvia,/Profile/3silvia,"Zurich, Switzerland",30
lahul_spiti,"hotel siddharth in tabo is the ideal kind of a budget stay. the rooms are clean and minimal. the windows open to apple orchards.best thing about the hotel is the terrace infront of the rooms on the 1st floor. you can sit there and spend a lot of time , while viewing the enclosing mountains all around. also the hotel is only about 5 mins walk from the tabo monastery. we had dinner here, and the food was really amazing. the bathroom was big and clean. helpful staff boys, and has a parking area too. room costed me Rs. 1000 for double bed room, advance booking. dinner was Rs. 700 for 6.",dwaipayandas,/Profile/dwaipayandas,"Kolkata, India",40
lahul_spiti,"Review is based on only one night solo stay. Location is perfect just couple of minute walk from monastery. On the way from main gate of Tabo to monastery its on right hand side 100-150 meters before monastery. I stayed in a room on ground floor, Rooms are clean and bed is comfortable. Staff is very helpful, cook was from bihar so on my  demand he prepared alu bhujia (bhihari dish) and it was awesome.",Anchal M,/Profile/anchalm2013,"Pune, India",40
lahul_spiti,"Perfect location - 3 minutes from monastery complex. New, clean, light colours, comfortable rooms ( beds specially). Nice atmosphere - we (group of 8 people) feld very freely. Hotel location allows to participate in early puja at the new monastery without a big sacrifice (puja starts at 6.00 am). Highly recommended - evening tea at the roof terracce...",Sapcia,/Profile/Sapcia,"Warsaw, Poland",50
lahul_spiti,"The Hotel is quite close to the Tabo Monastery. The rooms are fresh, basic but neat and clean. The washrooms are spacious and upkept.  The rooms on the first floor open to a Terrace and the view from there is pretty good. The staff is courteous but services may be a bit delayed since the staff prepares everything fresh. Tabo is well located for a trip from Kinnaur tom Spiti or Vice versa since it cuts down the travel by almost 50KM.  The approach lane is a bit narrow but the Hotel is drive-in",aman_malhotra,/Profile/aman_malhotra,"Bangkok, Thailand",40
lahul_spiti,"A hotel with basic amenities. Roof top Rooms are having good ventilation with attached terrace.  In case of Power Cut, management provides Battery Lamps.  Food and B/f is OK. Overall good location and with best service.",Sarathi Tours,/Profile/DattarajK,"Mumbai, India",40
