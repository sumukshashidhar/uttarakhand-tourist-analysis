On arriving here after a 12 hour journey, I suffered massive altitude sickness and also motion sickness. I had lost lot of fluid due to vomiting. By 10 pm my condition had worsened. This is when the owner who stays next to the hotel asked his manager to take his personal car and take me to a government hospital. His timely intervention helped my to enjoy rest of my trip.  The rooms were spacious and clean. Housekeeping was timely. Food was also decent. Everything was nearby and reachable by a short walk.

Though the rooms were neat and clean I felt that few corners needed mire cleaning and also room, specially doors do need some good maintenance. No T.V. was there in the room but as such never felt the need of a t.v.   Staff was very much co-operative and food was quite good. On our request they made one night dinner with local food which tasted quite good. The staff was knowledgeable and you can get tips from them as to what to see etc.  Wifi was there but very very slow and the problem got compounded due to frequent power failures though the Hotel had Power back up.

There was major problem of electricity in Kaza and the generators also run infrequently so, we were not able to get hot water for bath here. Main market was walking distance away from the hotel.

My friend and I had taken the super deadly Manali to Kaza route which offers stunning views but is akin to driving on a river bed. So we reached the hotel exhausted, hungry and disoriented at 11.30 pm at which time the manager Mr. Basheer personally received us and ensured that we ate dinner and provided whatever we asked for. The next day unfortunately my friend was down with AMS and the owner of the hotel personally drove us to the hospital and made sure she was treated and well taken care of.

Tasty homely food on request 5. Down to earth, knowledgeable and friendly owner (Tsering Bodh) 6. Unending hospitality  Good experiences: 1. We were a group of 5 and we had booked two rooms for 3 nights. On reaching Kaza, we were told very politely that we had rooms available, so we are providing you 3 rooms instead of 2 at the same price as earlier decided for all 3 nights! This is something which delights a customer instantly.  2. The staff helped us with warm water whenever there was no electricity.  Not-so-positives: 1. Frequent power cuts: Not their fault.

The staff are also cordial and helpful. Mr. Tsering went out of his way to help us arrange for ILP's for my friends who were from UK. He went to the SDM office and made sure we got the Permits as we were on a tight schedule and couldn't afford to lose time. The restaurant cum lounge area of the hotel is quite homely.

The staff was helpful and forthcoming in spite of the whole place being occupied by the rally crowd and all the ongoing action.   You can visit the Pin Valley from here. The drive to Ki Monastery is beautiful up the winding roads. At dusk, you may chance upon a mountain fox flaunting its bushy tail near the monastery, or rather a mountain fox may chance upon you.

They ensured we had the most comfortable stay both in terms of warmth n home cooked food. Hotel is situated at the best location .. You have an open view to the Hikkim on one side n all of Kaza town on the other and from your balcony you can surely have a spiritual high as the window opens to the Monastery. We stayed there for a night as we were crossing to Lohsar n then Chandertal but a night stay was enough to experience the local culture.

Usually, I travel using local transport wherever I go, but local transport being as it were in Kaza/Spiti (only real option is to hire cabs to move around, and that's expensive, esp for a backpacker), Tsering (enough good things have been said here about him by other reviewers, yet he deserves a special mention, and not just because of the warmth and good vibes he exudes) and Ravi, who was looking after Snow Lion helped me hook up with other travelers and thus share costs, make bookings and give general travel advice, all of which was extremely helpful.

Turns out to be a really good option. The place is a little secluded but the hotel itself is really well maintained and clean. The owner is friendly and he takes time to get to know you. He is quite the adventure buff and can guide travellers as well. The only issue I had was that we had to go to Sakya Abode for food (I can't recall why). The pleasant stay for three guys (single shared room) cost us 1300/- for two nights. Not bad eh?  PS: Lahaul Spiti is beautiful in  September. Very little tourist traffic.
