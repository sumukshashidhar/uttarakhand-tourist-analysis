lahul_spiti,We stayed here during our journey from Manali to Leh. It is located in Gemur village which is just 4 kms before Jispa. We had a great time here. The tents are facing the river and mountain. The owner was fantastic and staff were very helpful.,Tanmay Pal,/Profile/TanmayPal,"Pune, India",50
lahul_spiti,"Talking about this camp site, It's surrounded by beautiful mountains and river such that you feel like you are nearest to the nature, at there we feel like home although we are too far from our home. We feel like, we are not a their customers but their valuable guest.  Thanks a lot Padmaji and his family for your incredible support. It's not fair if I'm not mention Tenzin here, He worked there and helped us a lot. Highly recommended!üòä",Nilesh Patel,/Profile/_nilesh_090,,50
lahul_spiti,"We, a group of five bikers stayed here while going to Manali. We, accidentally discovered this place. We started the ride from Leh at 6.30 and reached Gemur in 12 hours, before rains and darkness forced us to call it a day. We spotted this tented accommodation and immediately checked-in. Very Neat and clean tents, hot water and delicious food took no time to replenish us. But something more memorable was waiting to be unfolded when we woke up to the misty mountains and the river flowing beneath. I would like to remember Gemur Holidays as a perfect blend of Comfortable Stay, Great Location and just the right amount of professionalism and hospitality to compliment this.",Pankaj Dalal,/Profile/pankajdalal_78,,50

lahul_spiti,"In June, 2017, three of us, enroute to Leh from Patiala, on bikes, booked a 2+1 tent for overnight stay at this property. The view from the location, itself, took away half of our fatigue. The rest was taken care of by Mr Padma Thilley's (the owner) hospitality. The tents are clean and well kept and all essentials are provided. Evening campfire followed by a tasty dinner (included in the price) further made our stay memorable. Watching sunrise and eating a hearty breakfast in such lovely environs gave us memories for life. Highly recommended for a stopover for all fellow travellers. Safe ridings.",hakunamatatad2k,/Profile/hakunamatatad2k,"Chandigarh, India",50

lahul_spiti,A great place to stay in serene beauty of nature. I love this place. We were four people and booked two camps here. Quality of tents and cleanliness is really appreciable. Food is also good which was cooked by our chef Ustadji. We felt like home when owner allowed us in the kitchen to prepare our own tea to satisfy our taste buds. These tents are owned by Padma thillay who is really helpful and supportive . He has made our stay really comfortable and memorable. Tents are good enough  and really warm in. Such a Cold place. They do have hot water facility which is normally provided in morning but you can request warm water for drinking at any time.2 pair of sleepers and 2 towels are also provided in the tent . Overall good place to stay and nice experience here. Best part of this,Shasank S,/Profile/shanky20,"Harl≈´r, India",50
lahul_spiti,"These are swiss cottages and are located far away from any villages. There is nobody around here which makes it an ideal place for a nature lover to stay at. The river flows right next to the camp.   The owner is a very nice and helpful person. He will cater to all your needs. The food was also pretty tasty. You can ask him about river crossing and hiking and he will help you plan those activities out.   We first had our doubts about staying in a tent in such a cold environment, but the tent is of good quality and provides some insulation. The bedding and quilts are more than enough to keep you warm.",Angad Singh,/Profile/angad2102,"Hong Kong, China",50
lahul_spiti,We had a stay here while we were going to Leh . Great place to stay with all the amenities and that lovely view of mountains and river üòç .
