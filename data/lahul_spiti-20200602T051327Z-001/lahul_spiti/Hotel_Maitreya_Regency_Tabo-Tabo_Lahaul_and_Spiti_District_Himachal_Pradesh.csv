lahul_spiti,I was surprised to find such a good hotel at a remote place like Tabo. Hotel has clean comfortable rooms with lot of blankets to take care of cold weather. Staff was very helpful. Tabo is a small place so the main attraction Monastery was just at walking distance and we visited twice during our stay.,DilipPune,/Profile/DilipPune,PUNE,50

lahul_spiti,"Maitreya is definitely one of the cleaner places in Tabo, however, their amenities are very basic and we were there for a whole night without any electricity. The hot water ran out and they had very basic electrical backups. The food is extremely basic too. It is good in terms of its location, for being placed very close to the stupa.",Urvashi Singh,/Profile/urvashisretreat,"Manali, India",40
lahul_spiti,"Stayed for one night while travelling from Kalpa to Kaza. There are very few non home-stay options at Tabo & this is one of the better ones like Dewachen’s.   Good large rooms with clean bathrooms. Tea-coffee maker is provided in the rooms. No wifi -as is the case in entire Spiti region hotels. Buffet breakfast/dinner is available with MAP option. Sweet dish is offered only if you ask for it.  King size bed in room but with damaged mattress - couldn’t sleep. As this was peak season, no room change option was available. Stray dogs are aplenty near the hotel because of couple of eateries around & continuous barking added to the woes.   Though Kalpa-Kaza can be done in one day with 7-8 hours drive, which is about 200 km but night stay at Tabo is inevitable & makes sense for the",Shailesh Dheman,/Profile/SHAILESHDHEMAN,"New Delhi, India",30
lahul_spiti,"Tabo wasn't our scheduled stop but because of delays due to landslides and terrain (which is taxing and a normal in SPITI) we decided to stay over at Tabo.   This is a great hotel, courteous staff, good food and rooms. We loved our surprise stay here.",Akanksha S,/Profile/akankshasingh18,"New Delhi, India",50
lahul_spiti,Room + Food + Service + Location   : Very Good ... Especially in Place like tabo where the OPtions are very limited . the walk outside the Hotel is also very neat and closer to all the main monatries . Tabo being a lonely place it is a good idea to choose this Hotel since all vehicles entering Tabo have to pass from here .,Shrenikbjain,/Profile/Shrenikbjain,"Mumbai, India",50
lahul_spiti,"We stayed in this hotel during our Spiti holiday in Aug 2018. The hotel is amazing and offers many luxuries, which are non-existent in Spiti.   It’s the only hotel in Tabo and is spanking clean.   The food is very good. Both veg and non-veg are available. The common room / restaurant has a TV and very cosy sitting. There is an outdoor sitting as well.   The room is large and we were 3 in a room without any problem. The extra bed was actually a bed and not only a mattress. There was hot water in the shower.   The location is good as it’s only 2 mins walking to the monestary. Although the same can be said for any other home stay in Tabo.   The staff is excellent too and they went out of their way to fulfill our requests. The owner is very helpful and he helped us by informing",Akshay Varma,/Profile/Axi13,"Nashik, India",50
lahul_spiti,This is a quaint hotel located in Tabo.the location is very good. It is about 5minutes walking distance to go the Tabo Monastery. Rooms are big and spacious. Food also is decent. Would have given it 5stars if it wasn't for the fact that food was not very hot. Otherwise the place is perfect! Looking forward to going back there! ,Annapoorna Pai,/Profile/apai0308,"Bengaluru, India",40
lahul_spiti,This could easily be the best property in Tabo.. we had a wonderful stay.. the room was well maintained and beds comfortable. The people running the place went out of their way to make our stay comfortable. The food was the only let down.,ShivaniSR,/Profile/ShivaniSR,,40
