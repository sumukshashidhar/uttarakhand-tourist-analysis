lahul_spiti,"The property is small and while the view is gorgeous and the people hospitable, and it was a pleasant enough experience, it is not a place that was memorable. The rooms are fine--the old ones are better than the new ones--so definitely ask for one of those.",Sayoni B,/Profile/Sayoni,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
lahul_spiti,"We had a lovely stay at the Banjara Sangla Valley during Sept'13.   Reasons: 1) Very helpful and active owner and staff. 2) Very comfortable rooms. 3) Awesome Food, which is included in the price. 4) What an amazing property and location.  I have been staying at several Banajara properties. Met the owner - Ajay Sud at this location. and he was very nice person and host. His knowledge of the area is very good.   We took the river view rooms, which are new in construction. The tents however may be a touch choice. There are some rooms which are coming up in the new building. They are so good and well planned. Awesome property and well thought of.",Luv Sharma,/Profile/LuvSharma,"New Delhi, India",50
lahul_spiti,"We drove to Kaza from Kalpa. While the journey was an adventure in itself, As we were nearing Kaza, our heart was hoping, that the Retreat would be as endearing as the one we encountered in Thanedar. We reached Kaza at around 7.30. It was already dark, and quite cold. When we reached the Banjara retreat, we were checked in to our rooms swiftly. The room was quite spacious. But cold.. No heater or thermal blanket there. The Manager however was an enigma. At times, he would seem to be the friendliest person, and at times he would be a closed person. The staff however was decently friendly. At the time we were there, there was another group, one member was a part of the Banjara group . The manager was all attentive to them.  Since it was off season, no programs were arranged for us",Nikhilrao68,/Profile/Nikhilrao68,"Mumbai, India",30
lahul_spiti,"The Manager and staff are very unhelpful. The property is poorly constructed, the main door always open, even during dinner time with gusts of snow blowing in while you eat. There is no heating and barely any water or electricity. The place is neat and clean, but that is the only saving grace. Will never go back.",diglossia,/Profile/diglossia,"Mumbai, India",10
lahul_spiti,"We stayed here in June 13 after spending some time in Sangla and Kalpa. Given our excellent experience in both those places, we were hoping to finish the trip with something equally memorable. When we arrived here, I must say, we were underwhelmed. The location isn't that great and view from the room also is mediocre (with lot of construction going on around the hotel). But the staff more than made up for it through its hospitality and excellent food. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of food at the hotel. The Manager helped up with out itinerary for places around Kaza and even took trouble to accompany us to show us the local market. The rooms are pretty basic (no TV) but comfortable.  As we had to leave at 5 am on our return trip, we requested them to pack our",Indianpopcorn,/Profile/Indianpopcorn,"New Delhi, India",40
lahul_spiti,"When we took trip from Batal to Kaza, we never expected to be greeted with wonders of nature as was thrown on the road as if GOD personally lived in this heaven. We hoped to have a vehicle which can provide 360 degree view. We were all blessed. With this feeling of peace and freshness when we reached Banjara retreat; Kaza, it was further enhanced with warm and smiling staff greeting us, helping us to settle in our rooms. Rooms were clean, airy and spacious with good view. The whole retreat had personalized touch to it in spite of being professionally managed.  Food was par excellence. They took care of us like we were guest at their home and not hotel. This in fact is what we have been accustomed to by now having been to most of their properties in the past. They certainly know",kaushik_bhavsar,/Profile/kaushik_bhavsar,"Mumbai, India",50
lahul_spiti,"We stayed at the Banjara Retreat as part of a road trip with a friend skirting all of Himachal in a Toyota Fortuner. We stayed at the Hotel for two very memorable days. This was my first trip to Lahaul and what struck me was the similarity of this valley to Zanskar. This valley which was formed several thousand years ago by a giant glacier cutting its way thru and submerging all marine life.  That morning we had started from Cheri near Udaipur and literally drove across the breadth of Himachal crossing Gramphoo, Batal, Kumzum La and Lohsar. We reached Kaza by 10pm and stayed at Banjara Camp there. The next morning when we came downstairs for breakfast I was surprised to see a table covered with fossils of sea horses and other aquatic species that were found from the river basin",neville_1409,/Profile/neville_1409,Mumbai,50
lahul_spiti,"Way back in 1996, it was a challenge to get decent lunch at kaza, let alone a hotel. Cut to 2012, 8.30 at night (that's when we reached kaza), we had the pleasant staff of banjara kaza lay us a delicious buffet!   This was my 4th visit to kaza, between 1996 and 2012, and the first where I spent 3 nights at the banjara camps kaza retreat last summer, was traveling with family, we had 4 rooms. Having stayed at their properties in Sangla and Thanedar earlier, you begin to wonder how do they manage to keep the same (well almost) standard across their properties.They have a lovely bunch of guys working for them, always smiling, and helpful.   The manger gave us his personal sim card to use (airtel and vodafone don't work in kaza) because one of us was sick and staying back at the",BasedMountain,/Profile/BasedMountain,,40
lahul_spiti,We were pleased to find that the people over here were very friendly and nice. They were enthusiastic about our arrival and keen on us seeing places too !!!   I consider the fact that they were able to keep us happy in-spite of the the power shutdown [ we had no power the entire duration of our stay ] ... an achievement.  Mr. Om Prakash of this place is a very enthusiastic trekker himself and helped us decide which places to go considering our diesel situation. They also arranged for diesel at Batal ( after Chandratal camping ) but were unable to do so at Kaza itself.,Vdy B,/Profile/VdyB,Pune,50
lahul_spiti,"We arranged a room and went to a dirty unkempt hotel, the price had more than doubled from what we had been advised, the room had just been put up to 5500 rupees from 2000 rupees. That was over five times the rate of similar hotels in the area.",Mike B,/Profile/noresponses,"Bangkok, Thailand",20
lahul_spiti,"I have travelled to some of the most remote locations in the Indian Himalayas, Zanskar, Kinnaur, Pangi, Spiti, Nubra, have stayed at many places but I am yet to come to anyone who even remotely comes close to the experience that Banjara provides, in hospitality and looking after you, even in remote Spiti!! Hats off to you guys.  Went up last summer with the kids and family, three days of hard driving from Delhi via Chandigarh and Sangla, reached late evening. The retreat is super nice, loved the peace and quiet of the place and is rather luxurious by Spiti standards..:).  The kids had a blast with the staff, from playing cricket at all times of the day, getting Maggi and French fries at whim, to getting totally besotted with the river camp the Banjara team at SangLa set up for",SanjitBal,/Profile/SanjitBal,"Gurgaon, India",50
lahul_spiti,"I would suggest everybody to not to ever think of staying at the Banjara Retreat in Kaza. We had been there this July. While checking-in we were offered 2 optipns, one was the rooms with the buffet and the other was without buffet. So, we decided on the option without buffet. When we settled ourselves in the room and wanted to order for starters, the cook suggested to also order for the dinner at the same time (18:00hr). So, we ordered for the dinner. After an hour the cook came and told us that the half of the things that we had ordered are not available. So, we asked him to tell us that what all can he manage. After thinking for a while, he said that actually he can not manage anything and the only option for us is to have the buffet. We were so surprised by this. We asked him",samsheo,/Profile/samsheo,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",10
lahul_spiti,"Hotel Banjara is a nice place to stay , and Kaza is a awesome place, though we can call it  Cold Dessert , but views are breath taking, Hotel service , food and room was good enough.",neemanima,/Profile/neemanima,Delhi,30
lahul_spiti,"Another decent Banjara camp (see also Banjara Retreat, Kaza) with a good view of the ancient temple. Not as much traditional furniture as at Kaza but the room is organized well. Welcoming manager and staff but with the same huge caveat as at Kaza: no space heater offered in a debilitating climate. It brought to mind that vivid Ezra Pound line: ""If the hoar frost grip thy tent / Thou wilt give thanks when night is spent."" Overall hospitality grade is the same as the night temperature.",Paul K,/Profile/go2places,California,20
lahul_spiti,"Kaza is the main town and administrative capital of the district of Spiti. The retreat is in a new building which is well built and nicely designed. The room is comfortable during the day. Attractive and useful furniture. Sheets look and smell clean. Hot shower water with good pressure but tank is too small and even a quick shower ends with a cold water rinse. Electrical system and plumbing seem up to standard. Good view of mountain and snow. Quiet with the exception of barking dogs. No heat, no A/C, no telephone, no TV. Good meals. Very friendly manager and staff.   But, with all that said, the nights were miserably cold -- and by night I mean from the end of dinner to the beginning of breakfast, about 12 hours. The outside temperature was just a few degrees above freezing and",Paul K,/Profile/go2places,California,20
