lahul_spiti,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights once while onward and once while returning and though a small property, the rooms were well maintained. The staff were very courteous and friendly and I should mention that they serve some absolutely tasty food and serve hot,  Bathrooms could be better as it looked dull without lighting and not so clean. Would be nice if this could be made better.",rads2k,/Profile/rads2k,"Chennai, India",40
lahul_spiti,Looks from the outside as bad as it is inside! Dirty bedsheets and dishonest staff. We got cheated with the drinks in the evening. Rate included breakfast and they wanted to charge us extra for fried eggs. Would definitely NOT stay there again!!!,Bernd W,/Profile/141berndw,"Singapore, Singapore",10
lahul_spiti,"What do you expect when you are in a far flung town with bad road connectivity and no communication means? Spa,elevators,24 hrs hot water,jacuzzi,gardens.Well this hotel has nothing of this sort.Its bang for buck,staff is good,food is average and the reason to stay here is. 1.hptdc hotel had some bad reviews and it is bang opposite to it. 2.it is on the leh manali highway so you dont need to go inside the town which is a one way only and pretty tight. 3.Problem of parking is present in every hotel in keylong except dupchen and chandrabhaga.",amitjatt,/Profile/amitjatt,,50
lahul_spiti,"In this far flung land you dont have plenty of choice for stay , so we just selected this bcoz of its location on the leh-manali road. Though the balcony in the room offers good view to the valley but other things are basic. Bathroom had geyser and in the room we had bell to call the service. Food was pathetic and you wont get anything from 2 pm till 6 pm as the whole staff goes on siesta mode.  ",ShivendraJadon,/Profile/ShivendraJadon,"Udaipur, India",30
lahul_spiti,"We stayed at Dupchen Inn on Leh Manali Highway just opposite HPTDC Chandrabhaga, from 17 to 18 May 2016 for 1 night while on business trip, in room 206,207 and 208 The hotel had opened just few days before and we were first few customers to have checked-in. The property is decent place to stay en-route Leh from Manali and also has good view from the valley side rooms.  The hotel has Solar system for hot water which was functioning very well and all other basic amenities in the room were functional. We did not have any food at the place and as such I am not sure about the quality of food. It certainly is a decent place to stay with good amenities at a location which is high altitude at Keylong.",MilindKshirsagar,/Profile/MilindKshirsagar,"Mumbai, India",40
lahul_spiti,We stayed in this hotel on our way from Leh to Manali and hence was a transit hotel for us. The rooms are spacious and clean along with good food been served in the restaurant. The hotel is right on the road to Manali and very close to the main market and hence at a strategic location and also commands good views. All in all a good hotel.,Avidtraveller79,/Profile/Avidtraveller79,"New Delhi, India",40
lahul_spiti,"The Best Option one can find in Keylong. Neat and clean rooms and washrooms, Lovely view of the Valley, good food and Helpful staff. Hotel is near the Manali - Leh Highway and easily accessible unlike other Hotels in this area which are located in very crowded areas and are not easily accessible. It is walking distance from the Keylong Market.",risenshine360,/Profile/risenshine360,"Manali, India",50
lahul_spiti,"It's not that this place is bad. Surely not. Nice view , clean place. The problem is the inexperienced and inhuman staff hired. The last thing this place has in store for u is hospitality. It was just out of the blue me n my friend rented a room n the only thing we were doing was fighting with the caretaker over. Think before u get in. Trust me as a himachali myself, there is far more a hospitality in himachal than this. ",the_rubberneck,/Profile/the_rubberneck,"New Delhi, India",20
