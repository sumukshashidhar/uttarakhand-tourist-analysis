lahul_spiti,Pros:  Good beds and warm blankets.  Lighting and indoor toilet and sink. Reasonably priced compared to others on site.Helpful staff and away from dusty roads.  Good tents.  Cons:  No warm water (lucky there is water in this remote place) Food is fair (lucky there is food at all)  This is basic accommodation period.  You don't come here for the accommodation but for the scenery which is fantastic.,Victoriantraveller5,/Profile/Victoriantraveller5,Victoria BC,40

lahul_spiti,"We had booked and paid for this cam after searching online, but after our arrival at Moonlake Camps we were shifted to a very basic accommodation not far from the actual camp, which was nowhere up to our expectation. ",Kaj Winther P,/Profile/kajwintherp,,20
lahul_spiti,"Moon Lake Camps is the first camp you come across while going to Chandratal. It offers you Swiss tents with double bed and an attached bathroom (western toilet and basin), there is a dining tent spacious enough for 5-6 tables. The food is cooked in another tent and served hot. there is abundance of water at the camp. All this at an economical tariff. Advance booking recommended during peak seasons.",Sanmitra M,/Profile/sanmitram,,50
lahul_spiti,"I'm not much of a camping person but this fell more into the 'glamping' category. We spent a night here wherein the Swiss tents provided adequate warmth against the bone-chilling cold. Each tent can house two adults & is provided with cots, blankets & lanterns. Please don't expect electricity! Smaller tents serve as the toilets. It's a cold desert region; so please don't waste water. There's a common dining area; no room service. We feasted on rice, daal makhni, mixed vegetables, sewai, aloo paratha & pyaaz paratha. The food is simple but wholesome & delicious. The people who run the place do so in trying conditions. Every possible basic amenity has been made available. Hats off to them!",Let's Go Sightseeing,/Profile/LetsGoSightseeing,"Noida, India",50
