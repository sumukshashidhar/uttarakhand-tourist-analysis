lahul_spiti,"My friend and I stayed at Norling Home Stay from 20th to 24th February 2020. The stay was comfortable and hospitality outstanding.  The entire family was always attempting to make our stay comfortable in extreme cold (minus 5 to minus 20 degree centigrade!) by keeping our rooms warm through tandooor and serving hot meals, garlic soup and snacks whenever we requested for. Tsering, the owner has a ever smiling and helping demenour. I strongly recommend it for a comfortable and caring stay!!",Aloke Gupta,/Profile/AlokeG57,"Kibber, India",40

Located in the quiet village of Kibber, Norling homestay offers hygienic rooms, great food and an extremely hospitable host Tsering Norphel. He along his team strives continuously to make all his guests comfortable. We were impressed by the variety of options provided for dinner ranging from Chinese, Spiti-special to North Indian.

lahul_spiti,"We had travelled with a group of 7 people in March 2019. A very good place to visit at any time of the year. They have all the basic amenities (including luxury) even in the winters, which some of the home stays in Kibber do not provide. The food here is top notch. No complaints whatsoever. Will be taken care of you and will make feel like home away from home.   As they say a home stay should feel like ""Home"", this place will never disappoint you!",Akshay G,/Profile/akshay2708,,50

Really Appreciate the way his efforts to find out of the way to get us connected over the phone to our friends when no cellphones networks were working. We had the best food in all the home stays we stayed during our entire trip. Very Well maintained room and the best part was round the clock hot water flow.

It has a TV with a seating arrangement with dining table. It also has a terrace with mesmerising views. But the best part is that, The Host was very gracious and humble and great hositality.

The dining room has a tv with satellite tv that includes international news stations like CNN and BBC, movie channels with English such as HBO. The room was clean and had 24 hour solar hot water.

lahul_spiti,"Me and one of my friend were doing the entire spiti valley circuit. Enroute we stayed at kibber, the most beautiful place for us in our journey and we stayed at norling home stay. Lets just day if kibber is heaven then norling homestay is the care taker of itl  Its rooms are absolutely clean, the owner is very kind and hospitable.  The food is simple (home made food). Views from the hotel is ultra amazing. You can see the entire galaxy in the night at kibber  Just for info : i got to know that people book this through agents. Its a sincere request you book it on your own so that the entire portion goes to the owner. That is dere only source of income.  ",mohit m,/Profile/mohitm348,,50
lahul_spiti,"Tsering Norphel , the owner of the homestay keeps the homestay like a hotel. All the facilities and the amenities are top notch. Hospitality is the best and the food, most authentic food of spiti that i can say for sure. And this homestay is also popular among celebs, when we checked in Sunny deol was there in the homestay for his movie shooting.

We were a motorbike group of 10, one man having had an accident and they couldn't have been more attentive and helpful. There was plenty of hot water in the bathrooms, the rooms were spotless and the views across the village spectacular. If our tour passes through Kibber again, we will be staying there for certain.",kateoliver33,/Profile/kateoliver33,"Manali, India",50
lahul_spiti,"Amazing hospitality by Tschering (i hope i got his spelling right) We took 2 rooms. Rooms looks good, have great views and have all the basic amenities. There are no televisions in the room (you don't need one over here) but there is one in common dining area. The attached bathrooms have 24x7 hot running water, an amazing feat.  Breakfast can be ordered as per the menu, omelette and aloo paratha were nice. The lemon tea and honey ginger lemon tea were amazing for the cold weather. Coming to dinner, there is set dinner which is available in buffet style (you can take multiple servings). We had veg manchurian and veg fried rice, it tasted good (i took 2 servings of manchurian). Two persons in our group were sick and even after having set menu for dinner, Tschering offered to cook",Rohan J,/Profile/rohanj958,,50
lahul_spiti,"I visited kibber on 4th June,2018 with my family. We had booked 5 rooms in norling homestay in kibber. Due to our car breakdown we reached at late night. But Mr Tsering who runs the place was waiting with meal ready for all of us, even though because of poor connectivity we couldn't inform him. The rooms were very warm and comfortable and the view is to die for. Overall loved the hospitality of the hosts and the serenity and silence of the place.

lahul_spiti,"We were in Kibber during the 3rd week of Feb 2018 and stayed at the Norling Home Stay. A warm and cosy home stay, with an amazing group of folks taking care of every possible need.   We enjoyed our stay very much. Food was good and they ensured we had something different everyday. The toilet was a dry toilet given the weather and the issue of water freezing during winters. The rooms were very cosy and comfortable with a fire stove and a heater in place to keep you warm. We had a nice common place to seat together on the first floor where we could chit chat or have our breakfast, lunch and dinner. Norfel and his family hosted us and took care of us well. The only 2 areas of improvement are the frequent power cut issue and a dedicated place to wash, brush etc.   Pros  * Location *",RahulPratti,/Profile/RahulPratti,"Hyderabad, India",40
lahul_spiti,"I stayed at Norling home stay from 17th Feb to 22nd ( Five nights ) . We were a small group in the quest of the Snow leopard .  Firstly the location of Kibber at nearly 14200 feet and temperatures of nearly Minus 15 to 20 at night meant we needed good warmth. And thankfully ,i had an electric heater and an electric blanket beside a super thick sheep's wool and a blanket to keep me warm.   Tsering Norphel , the owner and his family cooked such delicious food and took care of our daily needs . The times when electricity would fail, they would rush in with the gas warmers or start a fire in the room stove ( Each room has a stove with the chimney ). Its common to heat up food / beverages on top of these room stoves. I stayed at the roof top level rooms . The views from the balcony",208racecourse,/Profile/208racecourse,"Coimbatore, India",40

lahul_spiti,Mr Tsering is an excellent host and his welcoming nature gives us an experience of true Spiti Valley. Rooms were very comfortable with hot running water 24/7. Their terrace has an amazing view of entire Kibber village including the Kanamo Peak. They arranged our trek to Kanamo in 2N/3D and it was an incredible experience with his Uncle who was the guide (Lama-Ji). I think I cannot think of staying anywhere else other than this. Overall a good experience,Canif,/Profile/Canif,Delhi,50
lahul_spiti,It was just one night stay for me in Norling Home stay. It was as comfortable as home is! Hosts were very nice and warm ( specially Kunzum). Rooms were cozy and kept clean.

One can enjoy sitting in common area to enjoy view or simply chit-chatting with other travellers.Would love to come back.,Kriti A,/Profile/Kritipatil,,50
lahul_spiti,"Tsering, the owner is a sweetheart. He helped us with everything we needed and all the questions we had related to a trek we had planned. His uncle Lama is a legend. Both of them made our summit (Kanamo Peak) possible. I would recommend his place over any other in Kibber. The place is way more than what we expected from a remote location like Kibber.

lahul_spiti,"I had a wonderful time staying with my friends in this homestay at Kibber for a day. The host was super polite and co-operative with helping us with rooms, hot water and fresh coffee to be sipped on the top of it's terrace. Situated on the highest part of the Kibber further adds to it's beauty. This specially works at night, as the clear skies paved way for beautiful starry skies which we could see right from our window. It was indeed memorable. And yes, their home cooked food. I can never forget those manchurians. Had like 5 of them that day.",Keval B,/Profile/KevalB12,,50
lahul_spiti,We stayed in Kibber for a night and it was quite a pleasant stay. The home owner made us feel comfortable. The highlight was the homegrown chinese food.

All in all a very decent place to stop at in Kibber.,Naushad Ali R,/Profile/naushadalir,,40
lahul_spiti,"At first, it felt like a hotel masquerading as a homestay. It was huge, with a large dining hall that can probably fit 50 people with ease. But once you meet the owner, you will agree this is a homestay. Wonderful people. And Food! Wow!!! The dinner was Veg Fried Rice with Manchurian (with Gravy). And honestly, I am sure I have not had such amazing home cooked food in a long long time. They also have their own greenhouse organic farm from which the ingredients for the food are sourced.   Also, the owner does walk the extra mile for you. I had to urgently call someone and since the village is out of coverage area, there was little chance that I could get BSNL network.

Mr Tsering made us comfortable at his house and assured us that he will be our man if anything is needed at his high altitude house . Local home cooked food , spacious rooms with right blend of culture and tradition were the highlight of our stay . Western style clean toilets with 24/7 running hot water added up on the over all comfort at this beautiful homestay . If you go to Kibber , Norling home stay should be your place !

lahul_spiti,Is there anything left to say :-). If you get the above at 4000 mts in a village what else do you want. The family is highly hospitable. Rooms Are clean. Take the top floor two rooms with attached bath and terrace just outside. The terrace is brilliant for star gazing . The Milky Way is right out front. Food is simple like home food but the hospitality the hosts show is just so amazing . Will Recommend my parents to stay there if they were travelling there so that sums up my review I guess.

lahul_spiti,"I reached Norling from Chicham at around lunch time. Three takeaways from Norling:  1. Tsering Norphel and his family are the warmest hosts. Not very different from any other part of Spiti actually, but Norphel is tremendously dedicated to making sure his guests are comfortable. He is transparent, honest, and kind.  2. The room I stayed in had a tandoor. It helped that this was non-peak season and I got the whole room to myself.  3. The view from the terrace made my entire trip worthwhile. I saw the Milky Way for the first time. The star filled sky is unbelievably beautiful  Norphel Tsering can be reached at norlinghomestay@gmail.com.

lahul_spiti,"This is by far the highest home stay at Kibber - a one time highest village in Spiti.  The Norling Home Stay is an extension of the Norling Guest House - both located in Kibber. The home stay boasts a few rooms on two floors, a restaurant and an open terrace overlooking the mountain range ahead.  The rooms on the ground floor have one common bathroom and no running hot water (this I believe will be fixed soon). Although I couldn't see the rooms on the top floor, I have heard that they are much better.   If you do ever plan to visit places as remote as these it is better if you leave the usual luxuries aside.
