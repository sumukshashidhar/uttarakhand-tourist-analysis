He leaves no stone unturned to provide whatever best one can in those conditions. His family took care of us by all means and provided the best support.

lahul_spiti,"We were lucky to stay at the Tara House Home Stay for a night during second week of October 2016. Remotely located in the village of Mudh in Pin Valley, Tara House Home Stay is a small little oasis of comfort and hospitality. The rooms were clean and comfortable and the bathrooms spic and span. The view from the rooms and the cute little roof was of a very tranquil valley with snow capped peaks and a gushing river. The place is run by a very sweet family and they feed you with fantastic home cooked food. Our booking was inclusive of breakfast and dinner and we ended up stuffing our self with the lovely meals that they cooked for us. To sum it up, this probably is the best place for putting up at Pin Valley.  (The attached photos are from the roof of the guest house)",Aishwerya R,/Profile/aishweryar,"Bengaluru, India",50
lahul_spiti,"I am traveling to Spiti for a long time but to Mud it was my first trip. Honestly speaking I was not expecting a great place in such a remote area of Pin Valley. But the moment I entered the home and then the room, I was like, wow..! After a long drive I was tired so fell asleep soon after the dinner. When I woke up I felt the sun light straight in my room. What a view it was outside the window. A vast land in front then a range of mountains.  In the breakfast they provided pizza type dish made with bread, and everything you cant expect in this remote place. My host Sonam was such a hard working and shy girl.  Mud is a very small village and Tara House Homestay is almost at the end of it, on the left hand side. Highly recommended..!",Vinod V,/Profile/VinodV246,,50

We were warmly greeted by Tensing, the owner's son, who spoke very good English and was eager to talk to us about this beautiful valley. The guest house had a rooftop deck with views looking directly down the valley, several rooms have the same view. The rooms were clean and solar powered hot water was a welcome amenity. A small dining room server great food. I would recommend this guest house to anyone looking to stay at a local house and enjoy the company of friendly staff.",Brian A,/Profile/X5927UWbriana,"Yangon (Rangoon), Myanmar",50
lahul_spiti,"Mudh village is probably the most remote place in Spiti that you can drive to. The village was not connected by road till 2003. Given this remoteness, modern amenities of this hotel was quite surprising.  Pros: 1) You find all the modern amenities offered by this hotel: western flush toilets, geysers, solar power back-up etc. 2) The hotel has the best view in town. The sunset/sunrise view of the Pin Valley here is to die for. 3) The owners are very helpful and courteous. 4) The food is excellent. 5) Tariff is very reasonable. 6) Rooms and bathrooms are very clean. 7) Bed is very comfortable and so are the warm blankets that they supply. 8) This is the best accommodation in the entire Pin Valley.  Cons: 1) Rooms and bathrooms are pretty small. But that is the best they could have",rmanoj,/Profile/rmanoj,"Pune, India",50

Throw in some peaceful Buddhist culture and the humble locals and this place is the perfect getaway. One of the most popular places to stay in Pin Valley is Mudh Village, the last village in the valley. Mudh is also the base village for two popular Himalayan Treks - Pin Parvati Pass to Parvati Valley and Pin Bhabha Pass to Kinnaur. Tara Guest House is a beautiful place to stay, with stunning views, very clean toilets and cozy, comfortable rooms. The food served here was excellent, especially the local cuisine.

You would think it couldn't accommodate more than 10 people, but come evening, it's abuzz with twice as many trekkers and travelers. Time just flies by chatting with people you've never met; sharing experiences and exchanging travel stories.

lahul_spiti,"There was something magical about Pin valley. Despite being at such heights in the midst of cold desert the valley was very colourful and scenic. I definitely recommend a nights stay atleast. And what better place to stay then to stay at Tara's. I personally met with the owner of the place and happen to have a long chat during breakfast and he was so passionate about his place and village ( of 200 ppl). Its by no means luxurious and is minimalistic with all necessary amenities. The food options were also good considering the remote location. The owner's daughter Dorje was a gem of a person. She used to cook, handle clients, make bills, all at one time. Special thanks to Mudh village and Mr. Tara for creating warm memories of the place.",Vivek P,/Profile/vivekp143,"Mumbai, India",50

The first reaction one of my friend had after seeing the property was that we should have stayed here for more than one night. Though the rooms were slightly small but they were really comfortable and cozy. One of Mr Tara's son, Kunzam, himself took personal care of each and every traveller. Food was quite basic but equally wholesome and tasty, we actually asked 3-4 times for 'rajma', it was really fantastic. I would also like to especially mention about the local drink 'Changh' which was made readily available to us. Thanks Kunzam for the same.
