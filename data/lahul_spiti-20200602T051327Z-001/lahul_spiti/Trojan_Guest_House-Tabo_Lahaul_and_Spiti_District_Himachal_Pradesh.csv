lahul_spiti,"We stayed here for one night (17th Sept'17), started from Kalpa and called it a day at Tabo, though we did not search for any other place (this is the first hotel on the Tabo - Kaza road. We booked 2 rooms (one with 2 king size beds - accommodates 4 and one room with 1 king size bed). The room with 2 king size bed offers good view of the Tabo monastery. The food was basic but good (had vegetarian food only), the evening snacks were good too. The manager / person managing the place was police and helpful. The rooms are basic, washrooms were clean with geyser (don't know if they have power backup as there was not power cut when we stayed here). Next day morning before departing to Kaza we had breakfast (parathas) which were extremely good (though there is little wrong that can go",Prasanjeet M,/Profile/prasanjeetm2016,"New Delhi, India",40
lahul_spiti,"We stayed here at the end of October and  loved our stay at this property. Initially I did not like the hotel from outside. But then when I entered into the rooms I absolutely loved it. We were 3 people and we got 3 double beds (which can accommodate 6 adults). They said geyser is not working in a double room, so they provided us one room with 2 almost king size double beds and another double bedded room. We were confused what to do with those big rooms. The four-bedded room was very cozy. View from the room was also very good. Tabo monastery was not far. Geyser was perfectly working fine in the rooms. The rooms were very well insulated, since we were warm inside the room when the temperature was around -15c at the end of October.  At night there was no electricity for sometime.",riadas,/Profile/riadas,"Pune, India",40

lahul_spiti,Small and comfortable place for a quick night halt and affordable. Food is good and service is also prompt. Just beside the main road and near to Tabo Monastry.

lahul_spiti,We had been there in last May. Good rooms as it is just stopover between kalpa to kaza. Bathroom is ok. Got jain meal. Also got hot water on request. Owner Mr. Rameshji is very cooperative & friendly. No power during over stay but provided led lights. Walking distance from monastery. ,shahsamip,/Profile/shahsamip,,40
lahul_spiti,I have stayed many times in this property and in the big family room. It has two bedrooms attached and both have 2 washrooms. It was earlier a Banjara property on lease. That is the reason why it is clean. Food is awesome. There are some instances like slow food serving and a bit messy rooms when manager or staff changes. Otherwise it is one of the best place to stay in Tabo along with the Monastery Guest house in Tabo which is mostly full.,Saurabh B,/Profile/saurabhbassi,"Shimla, India",40
lahul_spiti,"This is by far the best place to stay in Tabo. Nice clean guesthouse. Very good food. Remember these are small areas and you won't get to eat what you desire, but the typical Indian home made food served here is delicious. One vegetable dish, Dal, Rice, Roti, Salad, Parathas is more than enough for anyone in this part of the world. Worth every penny we paid. Cosy rooms with hot bath is what we needed after a long tiring day of driving and that's what precisely was on offer. They also have rooms for 4 adults.

lahul_spiti,"We reached this hotel on 3rd october from Kaza. On our arrival we had an awkward experience. We had prior booking from Kolkata though the manager informed us that there was no room available. He took us to a nearby homestay though it was devoid of any facilities. After repeated implorings the manager finally gave us a room which was quite moderate. Bathroom was ok though a bit shabby. The hotel is located at a 5 minutes walking distance from the Tabo Monastery,a place of great heritage with apple trees nearby and that is the main pros. The hotel boys are ready to help always. Apart from the initial horrible experience we had a decent stay at the hotel.",201411pp,/Profile/201411pp,"Naihati, West Bengal, India",30
lahul_spiti,We stayed here for a night during our halt in Tabo. Good property. We took pictures of the Milky Way from our room itself. The view was very good. Nice clean and neat place. Food was also good. We had local food Thukpa from their kitchen and was very good. ,AngelsOfMercy,/Profile/AngelsOfMercy,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",40
lahul_spiti,"It was June 2014, we were heading back from Kaza towards Nako... .. while on our way at around 4 p.m. we decided to halt and have rest at Tabo and visit the Tabo Monastery the next morning before leaving... After checking on with 3-4 rest houses nearby we zeroed in on Trojan Guest House, Tabo. The owner gave us a very warm welcome and good deal for the rooms too. took one Double sized room and a single one. Rooms were spacious, comfortable high mattress bedding, wel lit, and clean.  Hosts forthrightly told us that it would take a while to cock food and we may order in advance.  It being just 5 p.m. by then, we ordered... Veg Pakoras... and opened our bottles of Old Monk.

lahul_spiti,"We reached there at the end of the day, around 6:30 PM. The rooms were ok, but service was very bad. There was no hot water and the next day,also, the staff was very rude and said that they can't give hot water and if at all, we want to have a bath, it would be with cold water only. Also, the food was very ok and they were not co-operative at all. Also, they could not make Jain food and we had to make the food on our own in one of the dirtiest kitchen you could ever see.

lahul_spiti,"We arrived here in the dark- 8pm, with a power cut to boot. The owner was welcoming and showed us a clean spacious room. Then when we asked the price, he told us 2000/-. We were quite surprised because we knew from previous reviews and also having travelled extensively that these rates were not appropriate. Anyway, we bargained it down but it left a bad taste.   The only dinner options we were offered were dal, mixed vegetables, rice and roti- so we went ahead and ate the food- simple but hot. (No menu card available so you don't know the options available and what you will be charged- the owner is simply cooking something in his kitchen and serving it). Next morning we had to call out repeatedly for tea and were finally served by a disgruntled lad- and it was 7:15 am! (At all",narayanii,/Profile/narayanii,Kolkata,20
lahul_spiti,"Surprisingly this was too good. Mr. Lama Thakur, the owner of the property, gave us a very warm welcome. The food was too good, made by his wife, just like home.

lahul_spiti,"Despite reaching extremely late in the evening, the guest house personnel were so warm and welcoming that it felt at home in that remote locale as well. The rooms were spacious yet cozy. In some of the rooms there were two double beds. They served us hot food, although there wasn't any electricity for sometime while having dinner, it added to the mystic appeal of that place i guess, there was bright moon light outside, and candle light dinner inside the dinning area. Food was good and served in the common dinning hall. The Guest house is five minutes walking distance from the 1600 years old Tabo Monastery. The owner of the Guest House is extremely sweet, caring and helpful. At night one can sit outside and gaze at the moonlit sky for hours..Its indeed beautiful.

lahul_spiti,"We arrived late in the evening as there was a road block at Hurling which 17 kms from Tabo towards Nako. We did not have a booking - but there were rooms. We were shown a clean spacious room with a king bed with clean sheets, towels etc. The quilt and blankets were clean too. The geyser was functioning and the room smelt fine. We had a quick dinner - takes while to get it ready - so best is to decide the menu before you freshen up. The bed mattress was soft and firm and we enjoyed a good sleep. The guest house is on the main road towards Kaza and faces the mountains. The monastery is 5 minutes walk from the guesthouse. Food is good and the owners are very caring and friendly.

lahul_spiti,"Trojan Guest House was not our first destination upon reaching Tabo, India, high up in the Himalayas of Himachal Pradesh. The managers of the Hotel Mount View, Kalpa, where we stayed a few nights earlier, suggested a guest house for us near the monastery in Tabo. Unfortunately with the time of our travel being the same as the Bengali/Diwali tourist season all the rooms were full. We were met in the parking lot by a cheerful young man who had expected us the day before ,which, had it not been for my Inner Line Permit experience we would have arrived on schedule. Not to worry though...he jumped in the backseat and directed us to Trojan Guest House.   Located right on the main road you can’t miss this charming place.
