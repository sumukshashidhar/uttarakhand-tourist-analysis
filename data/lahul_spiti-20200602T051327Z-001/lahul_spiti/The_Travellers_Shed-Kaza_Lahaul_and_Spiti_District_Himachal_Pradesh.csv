lahul_spiti,"The Travellers Shed made my winter spiti (Feb 2020) the most amazing trip i ever had. This was my first trip with the travel group and i never imagined this would be my most memorable trip. From the beginning, Everything was well organized, They treated me like a friend. Met their amazing team Sahil, Arun and Shantanu before heading spiti. We had a comfortable Volvo bus till shimla. Amazing home stay, hotel, cozy warm rooms, live local music performance in tabo, delicious food, sightseeing, village and market walks. Special thanks to Arun shokeen, who treated me like his family member and organized every single small thing so properly. He was not just an organizer but an avid traveller himself. His love for the mountains are so deep, that he couldn't stop sharing his travel",SomaGhosh,/Profile/SomaGhosh,"New Delhi, India",50
lahul_spiti,"Terrible place. Dishonest staff.   On 11th July 2019 after a gruelling trek when I reached hotel they could not retrieve my advance payment done more than two months ago and did not give me a room in Traveller's Shed as they were overbooked. They put me  up in an alternate hotel of lower specification and did not refund any money for that night. Next day 12 July 2019 they did give me a room in travellers shed but service was slow (asked for a thermometer as my son was running fever and never heard from them) and there was no hot water in the pipes. To top it all and PLEASE NOTE THIS - the hotel charged me for tax amount while giving a ""cash memo"" i.e. kuchcha bill. Only when I raised issue and insisted on a GST bill did they give a proper bill. As they say BUYER BEWARE, if I",Dibyapran,/Profile/Dibyapran,,10
lahul_spiti,"Good contemporary rooms - suitable for bikers.  The staff and management is not so friendly. It was difficult to deal with them.  Amenities are poor - Eg. Drinking water in the room, Hot water for bath is not guaranteed, Wi-Fi does not work.",VikramVPrabhu,/Profile/VikramVPrabhu,"Bengaluru, India",20
lahul_spiti,"Just stumbled upon this place in Kaza while looking for accommodation options. Overall the entire place is done up very tastefully with personal attention to details. Feels like a piece of art rather than a hotel. Rooms are spacious and clean. Most have good views. Clean bathrooms with 24-hour hot water (solar). The common spaces are very well designed to promote interaction amongst fellow travellers. Food has options to satisfy any cravings, and is freshly prepared. Best initiative is they provide filtered drinking water. Mineral water in plastic bottles is not sold by them as the resulting pollution is a serious concern in the region.",Ring,/Profile/rinesh1,"Ahmedabad, India",50
