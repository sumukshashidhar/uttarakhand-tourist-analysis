True to Spiti tradition, the décor is predominantly Buddhist, the dining area large, airy and clean. The rooms are well appointed considering the remote-ness of the area.

Some nice music was also put on by the owner despite we two being the only guests on a early morning.

One 3 bed room was available for us which had a big balcony. The hotel is bang on the right side of the Tabo Kaza highway, opposite Tabo monastery. Spiti river is a 10 minute walk from the hotel. Food was freshly prepared but taste was not great. One point to be remembered: There are frequent power cuts in the entire Spiti region which may last for hours. This hotel has inverters which operate till night. However, inverter back up may not be available throughout the night.  I would rate this hotel very high given the budget and the location.",ArindamC_Kolkata,/Profile/ArindamC_Kolkata,"Kolkata, India",40

But what will bring you back to reality, and in the most amazing way, is the hospitality here.  Situated, right on the Tabo-Kaza road, this place can be easily mistaken for just another building.

Tow Dhey is located in the centre of the Tabo village and provides a gorgeous 180 degrees view from the room balconies. The rooms are well maintained, beautifully decorated and very cosy. We also enjoyed our meals here which were speciality Spiti cuisine! Plus the hot pakodas served with tea on our balcony were the best part of our stay!

Add a couple of delyas due to truck breakdown and we reached late afternoon. The stairs to the Tabo caves start right next to the hotel. After checking in and relaxing over tea, we stepped out to visit the caves and caught the beautiful sunset over the mountains. The slight elevation of the caves meant that you can watch over the town and relax as the light fades.  The room came with a balcony, a nice bed, two chairs, and a toilet. The toilet was very clean as of course was the room, decorated in typical spiti style with a lot of wood carvings. There is no TV in the rooms, not that we missed.

Located in the main road from Tabo to Dhankar, Tow Dhey is a new property located at very close proximity to Tabo Monastery (just 5 minutes walking distance). Even though another Property ""Dewachen Retreat"" is close to Tow Dhey, I would suggest travelers to opt for Tow Dhey as the same facilities can be availed at a price much less compared to Dewachen Retreat.
