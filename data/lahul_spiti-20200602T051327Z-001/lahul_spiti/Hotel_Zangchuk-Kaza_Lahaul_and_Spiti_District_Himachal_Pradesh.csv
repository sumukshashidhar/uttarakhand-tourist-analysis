lahul_spiti,"I have worked with this hotel so i stayed for a long time. Morning and evening view from room's balcony looks mesmerising. Rooms are small but neat and clean,we can't say that rooms are well furnished but what else can you expect in Himalayan Desert. Highly recommended ",Ravinder,/Profile/Its_ravinder,"McLeod Ganj, India",50

lahul_spiti,I visited spiti valley in august with my friends. We didnt booked hotels online so we searched for rooms by ourselves. Finally we got rooms at hotel zangchuk for 800/room. It was a good hotel with rooms with attached washrooms and with balconies and a nice view of mountains. Food was average but still it was better than other places those we tried in kaza. ,jeevannsingh,/Profile/jeevansingh007,,50
lahul_spiti,I stayed for 23 days in kaza and i tried 3 places to stay but i found out hotel zangchuk as a best option. At first i hesitated to stay their bcoz to be honest i didnt found good stuff about them on google but when i stayed i found all opposite. Rooms were spacious food was nice. Yes there was no wifi but still it was a good hotel with cheap rates. They didn't served food in the rooms for xyz reasons on a very cold evening. Staff was very healpful. Their were a huge parking space. With My room i got private balcony with a wonderful view of kaza city. According to me its a must visit place. ,Ravinder,/Profile/Its_ravinder,"McLeod Ganj, India",50
lahul_spiti,no doubt hotel is near by market area .... but you can get other better options in the same price .... staff was rude they directly say no on your face if they dont want to provide you something ..... you cant sleep in day time because construction work is going in and around the hotel .. food is avoidable (trust me not god at all) better you can explore kaza market and look for restaurants ... big thing is to attract customer they have written wifi on front gate but when you see closely there's also written No in small font :D,windofhope,/Profile/windofhope,"Sikkim, India",30
lahul_spiti,"Its filthy, no service, bad food, pathetic staff, no furniture in the room except a bed, terrible washrooms, no wifi, kitchen opens very late in the morning, no amenities...........you get much better rooms at a cheaper price!",namratawakhloo,/Profile/namratawakhloo,"New Delhi, India",10
lahul_spiti,"This is a budget property, centrally located at Kaza, with minimalistic facilities. We had booked a room downstairs but that was not much spacious for our family of 3. So they upgraded our stay to an actual triple bed room at the ground floor(which is actually the top floor of the hotel) and the room was spacious and up to the mark with one extra cot and fancy looking room accessories. Every room has an attached balcony from where you can have an overall view of almost entire Kaza village. The restaurant is also at the ground floor with limited choice of dishes. The food is not so delicious but just suitable for your taste buds and enough in quantity. The service was so so. You could hardly ever find someone at their front desk. But once you manage to find someone from inside",ayansg,/Profile/ayansg,"Howrah, India",30
lahul_spiti,"Upsides: cleanliness (both room itself, bedsheets and bathroom), central location, view from the room and balcony. Downsides: the room was almost bare, with not sufficient space even to hang clothes. In the afternoon the sun shines directly on balconies, so sitting down and enjoying the view is actually possible only after sunset. No laundry service (a general problem in Kaza - finally Hotel Deyzor saved us from trouble and did our laundry). We paid 1000 Rs for what was described as the best room, which would cost maybe 700-800 Rs in other places in Spiti or Kinnair. We tried the restaurant once but the food was far from impressive, so we ate at other places afterwards.",Jozin,/Profile/Jozin,Poland,30
