lahul_spiti,"I understand all the negative reviews of this place, but understand that they are coming from people that are looking for a standard hotel.  The facts are these:  1.  The rooms are spartan and actually they're not rooms, they're huts.  This means there are bugs in there with you and there will also be wind flowing through all day/night.   2.  Heating and AC are not options 3.  No TV 4.  Food is incredibly delicious... seriously, when we were there it was easily some of the best meals of my trip.  5.  You can do laundry... it will be by hand and air dried. 6.  The views are beautiful and well-worth the inconvenience of losing the amenities we've come to rely on.  If you can embrace adventure, then go!!",Rezanate,/Profile/rezanate,"Los Angeles, California",40
lahul_spiti,"Stayed at the Drilbu Retreat on 21.08.2018, while riding on Leh - Manali highway.  The location of the hotel is superb. You can view the confluence of two rivers Chandra and Bhaga, just below. By the side of the hotel Tubchiling Gompa is there.  The facilities met our needs - enough space for parking. Hot water was available. The food was good and served hot. Since this was the last night on our 10 day, motorcycle tour, the hotel made arrangements for campfire, and dinner out in the open.",VJ1974,/Profile/VJ892147,India,30
lahul_spiti,"These are VERY primitive meditation huts barely providing the basics.  They are located high above the hills next to a monastery and are retreat huts.  They comprise of basic bamboo walls and dirt floors with carpets.  There is one bare lightbulb with no electrical outlets to charge anything.  A simple asian bathroom with no hot water.  VERY firm cot sized beds, not even twin sized and harsh sheets.    Even worse than the location and the accommodations is the staff.  When we inquired about hot water and heaters for the cold nights they laughed and told us it was summer even though the temperatures will hovering around  2 celcius.    We asked about a refund policy and after being told to wait for 5 minutes we gave up after 30 minutes and found a great hotel in town.!

lahul_spiti,"Terrible cottage in the middle of a cabbage field. Stay away from here. Camps of Ladakh, the company taking care of the reservations of many camps around the area, pushed us in order to pre-book the service but it’s totally not necessary in this area. Due to weather conditions you are going to change plans rather frequently ant it’s definitely not a good idea booking in advance. Apart from the flexibility, you will avoid any bad surprise like the one we had at Drilbu Retreat.",Albe,/Profile/Albe839,"Milan, Italy",10
