lahul_spiti,"This hotel is fairly old and well-known. The rooms were quite good, and the food was also good. In fact, the staff even bought fresh fruit on our request. The staff were very helpful in that they immediately organised the rooms and food for our school group, even though we arrived late at night. There were just a few inconveniences, for example, hot water is only available at daytime. Otherwise, this is a good hotel located in a wonderful town.",Rohan S,/Profile/RohanS1707,,50
lahul_spiti,"Pros: The location is excellent.  Cons: Everything else. To begin with Ri-dzong Hotel is next to a very popular hotel. So they get a few of leftover bookings of that hotel.  There is no geyser, no room service, no solar power backup. For almost everything staff   says upfront no under excuse that owner said no to morning tea. Owner said no to room service. Owner said no to power before real dark night. Most of the staff is farm labor. They know nothing about hospitality and for trivial things they ask you question and humiliate you. For example since they don't have geyser, they do provide hot water by bucket in morning. Since they don't have intercom as well, you have to climb down two stairs, try to find out a staff - most of them never stay at reception. With lot of effort",Nitin Tripathi,/Profile/travelwithnitin,"Lucknow, India",10
