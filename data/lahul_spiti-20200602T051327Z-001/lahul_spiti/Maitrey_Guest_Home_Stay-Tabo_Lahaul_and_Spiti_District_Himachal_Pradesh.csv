lahul_spiti,"The restaurant of this GH is just awesome. They have wide range of cuisine to offer at reasonable price. One can have Indian, Continental, Spanish, Italian and Mexican delicacies under one roof here. We had Dal, Chawal and plain Sabzi at Dinner but the quantity and serving was very good. They provide freshly cooked food once order is placed. The kitchen is very next to the dining hall and clean. Next day morning we had Aloo paratha with achar, omelette and a glass full of black tea only at Rs.140 for two!   Please try any food there at least when you are in Tabo.",BongtravelR,/Profile/bongtravelR,"Kurseong, India",40

lahul_spiti,The rooms here are very good compared considering the location. The food they offered was very good and there were too many varieties which was beyond our expectations.

lahul_spiti,"Tabo is a delightful little village nestling in the rugged mountains of Spiti Valley. The peace emanating from the Tabo Monastery engulfs the village and you feel it the moment you alight from your vehicle. I would suggest spending a day here to experience the peace and serenity, so rare nowadays. I would also suggest spending the night at Maitreya Regency hotel located next to the monastery. It is a deluxe hotel with large clean rooms and good amenities. The Buddhist era decorations of the hotel go well with the surroundings. What came as a surprise was food ‚Äì really good and plentiful. And many a thanks to Dhaniram who looked after us very well.",Anil G,/Profile/280anilg,"Houston, Texas",40

lahul_spiti,"We loved our stay at Maitrey Guest Home Stay. We visited Tabo on July 31st, 2016. We booked the 1st floor corner room with windows on three sides of the room. We had a view of the Monastery on one side and the clear blue sky on the other. The service quality was very good, Dhaniram - the caretaker was very courteous and helpful.   There are a couple of new places opening up in Tabo but I believe, Maitrey has an upper hand given its location - right next to the monastery",vijaypillai_iceman,/Profile/vijaypillai_iceman,"Mumbai, India",50

lahul_spiti,"Maitreya guest house is located right next to the old and majestic monastery of Tabo. The food served is delicious and makes you feel instantly at home. The hosts are a couple with a ready smile and a helping hand. They are nice to talk to and if you are coming here on a road trip from Reckong Peo side, do take notes about the weather and terrain ahead from fellow travelers staying here.",shahneizer,/Profile/shahneizer,"New Delhi, India",40
