lahul_spiti,"A good hotel for a night hault, the rooms were clean and well managed staffs. The food too was well cooked. Jispa is on the way to Leh from Manali and a one stay is needed and this hotel is suggested to serve the purpose",Prameet P,/Profile/paulprameet,"New Delhi, India",40
lahul_spiti,"I visited the hotel on my way to leh. But due to heavy snowfall, all the roads were blocked and my stay at this hotel exte der for 4 days. The staff is really helpful and friendly. The electricity hardly comes and the generators work for 2 hours in the evening. The hotel is clean and the food is also decent. Would not mind staying again.",kunal chopra,/Profile/kunalc263,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
lahul_spiti,"It’s approachable, basic but clean. The food is good. They had a German Shepherd pup who was the highlight of our stay. They have a secure parking which is a huge advantage. If you are riding to Leh you probably want to leave early so please plan morning grub in advance they don’t have a 24x7 kitchen.

lahul_spiti,"Oh what a relief. This was was a tremendous relief after the stay in a tent  at Sarchu on my way from Leh along this high way. This hotel has good rooms with room heaters, hot water and a clean and reasonably good toilet facility. A good place to eat the food was ok nothing exotic. the place around is all green with trees and some apple trees full of apples. There is a river below to take a stroll around. Fresh air and for the first time i started getting BSNL mobile connection. For the last 48 hours i was cut off from the other world. But then the journey through the mountain roads were mesmerizing experience",Sojan Ipe,/Profile/SojanIpe,"Ernakulam, India",40
lahul_spiti,"I stayed for a night at Yak hotel , jispa while travelling down from Leh. I reached Jispa at around 9 in night and finalised this as was out of energy to search for hotels & negotiate at that point of time.  Its bang on highway as all other properties in Jispa are. A newly constructed hotel so rooms & linen was comparatively clean. price wise it was reasonable as they negotiated well. A very basic hotel and apt for a night halt.  Food was pathetic & expensive too. they dont have room service & even dont have intercoms in rooms, so for everything one has to go down to reception. parking was there in the premises for about 10 cars. No WiFi facility at hotel.  Overall a basic hotel, if one has time to go and search for hotels, compare 2 or 3 & then decide.",nynikhil,/Profile/nynikhil,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
lahul_spiti,"I only stayed here for a night but the service I received was so good that I had to put up a review. I was travelling by myself and so sick the day I stayed there. Seeing that I was very sick, Lal Singh took good care of me, made sure I had food to eat and water for inhalation. He was exceptional, even at time of dinner came to check on me to see I was going ok. I really appreciated someone looking after me like family in middle of nowhere. Staying there, such exceptional care and service, I have no words but thank you from the bottom of my heart. The room was clean and there was hot water and the food was delightful.",Leena V,/Profile/183leenav,"Brisbane, Australia",50
lahul_spiti,We were here on 7th of August on our way to Manali from Leh. We were the group of 4 couples. We were given 4 rooms on 2nd floor.  Good things :  1. Hotel rooms were good. 2. View from one side of hotel is good(You can see the river) 3. Food was good. One of the best parathas and tea we had on our trip. 4. Plenty of parking space.  Bad things :  1. Rooms were good but wasn't clean. 2. There was dust everywhere in the room. 3. Hotel staff is not at all helpful. They end up giving any random reason for random things. For example when we asked why TV isn't working we were told it's because of weather. 4. There is not intercom in the room. So every time you need something you'll have to personally go to reception. 5. As were very tired from our journey we had ordered tea at around,Rushikesh K,/Profile/RushikeshK_12,"Navi Mumbai, India",20
lahul_spiti,"It is perhaps the best place to stay in Jispa. Newly constructed, its junior staff lacks manners. Later the owner sorted it out. Overall a good hotel in a small place , which is a stop over on the Leh highway at reasonable height.",Rajm133,/Profile/Rajm133,"New Delhi, India",40
lahul_spiti,We stayed here for one night. Rooms are big and clean. Food is a bit expensive. We made an arrangement with the staff about the price of the room. In the morning the charged us an different (higher) price and they insist that we should pay that. With three man they told us to pay and they became very dominant. Not a nice experience in a country where we met almost everywhere honest and very nice people.,Silanny,/Profile/Silanny,,20
lahul_spiti,The hotel is on the highway and helps especially those who are tired after a good drive from Manali. The rooms are clean and the blankets are neat without any smell. The bathrooms have running hot water 24 hours. The staff are courteous and the owner is mostly there all time. The staff are very warm and forthcoming and eager to serve you. The food is decent and have both veg and non-veg. The restaurant is basic in layout and it is buffet for dinner. We did not have the breakfast as we left early in the morning so we really don't know much about it.,Sumanth C,/Profile/Sumzzup,"Bengaluru, India",50
lahul_spiti,"Good stay option in Jispa. Clean rooms, good food and nice staff. No wi-fi or mobile network in this area. No room service so you have to step out to reception. Location is good, next to river and the hotel is situated on main road. ",Megha S,/Profile/meghas_13,"Gurgaon, Haryana, India",40
