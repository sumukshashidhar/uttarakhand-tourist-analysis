Undoubtedly the best Hotel to stay in Kaza. we found everything to be perfect here, Owner of the hotel Mr. Karanbir himself is involved to make sure that the stay is comfortable and hassle free. Rooms are beautifully maintained matching to the local ambience. Restaurant offers great variety of food and drinks and is beautifully decorated and maintained.

lahul_spiti,"Believe me friends,  when I booked this hotel online, i was thinking that it's ""just another"" hotel, but when we reached there... it was most happening place in Kaza, amazing hotel(though simple), amazing and passionate owner Karan and his Australian wife. Do not surprise if you find some of the best international artist, painter or poet, from anywhere in the world, seating next to you. Friends seeing us believing. Karan and his team has put in lot of efforts to decorate this place, which is worth exploring. Don't stay anywhere else when you are in Kaza. Rooms are small but worth its price and food is yummy though bit costly. No substitute for Deyzor when you are in Kaza.",ajayshah67,/Profile/ajayshah67,"Mumbai (Bombay), India",50
lahul_spiti,"Deyzor has a life of its own. Each wall has an opinion and philosophy for you to reflect on. When I first walked in to this cafe, I fell in love with it. The all inclusive philosophy it wears openly, it is as if Deyzor has a heart and a soul, and a beautiful one at that. And then, I visited again and stayed here for a couple of weeks.  The love and passion with which this place is created is loud and clear with its beautiful decor, the countless cute trinkets and all the writings on the wall.  Deyzor has a great collection of books, the warmest people (Karan, Puneet and team) as hosts, delicious food, and the cutest four legged beings mainly Simba (if he likes you that is ;) ) .  It’s not just another hotel, it feels more like someone has let you inside their tastefully done",Nivi,/Profile/nivich,,50

Just want to reiterate that if you are going to Kaza, THIS is the place to stay - period! One look at the place and you can tell that Deyzor is much more than a structure - Karan has put his heart and soul into it and it shows! It is a home away from home - would love to come back soon! What also makes it different from other hotels is the fact that Karan loves Spiti like his own home and his sensitivity towards environment conservation is commendable.

Hotel Deyzor is located in the lap of nature. The hotel is nicely decorated. The walls are painted and filled with projects, messages, speeches, photo frames, and artworks. It gives a unique experience. In case of a dull day, probably someone can spend hours reading the quotes and observing the photos and artwork. This shows the taste of the owner and changes an accommodation transaction to an enchanting experience. The rooms are nice, big and cozy.

It oozes warmth out of it just like the people in the valley. It has been decorated beautifully with little little things related to Spiti valley and culture so that you only get to soak in more of the beauty of the valley, its culture and its people. The entire staff is amazing (I remember a few names like Rakesh who was an amazing help during our stay).

lahul_spiti,"Situated right in the heart of Spiti Valley at Kaza, Deyzor will permanently alter a few concepts in our minds as to what hospitality should be. Atleast in my case, it did. It was simply the best experience I have had when it comes to putting up at a place during travel, as I shall now explain. In the last half a decade or so, I have been an avid traveller, seizing every opportunity to do so and in the process having the privilege of experiencing boarding and lodging of all classes from luxury to budget to home stays and camps. What exalts Deyzor to the very top is, as my friend Karan (the owner) very aptly puts it, is “all heart”.

Very clean hotel made with an idea of home feeling (photographs on all walls, corridors with small note for each, keeping antiques and books on self) and a sort of antique touch and feeling everywhere.  3. Cozy  Could be better: 1. Arrangements of hot water (had geyser but works very late or were not working for sometimes, atleast in our room for first day)  2.

Karan has handpicked all the artifacts that you find at every nook and corner and placed for a reason. For eg, the aerated drink canisters made to look like surveillance cameras... how could one think of something that quirky.  Another highlight , the food ... it’s finger licking good.

Such tastefully done rooms and interiors.. free WiFi even if it's slow.. running hot water.. delicious food.. and above all, the unmatched hospitality.. Even when there is no power, they provide you the hot water in buckets from their solar gyser. We stayed here three days from 13th to 16th August 2017 and no one from our group wanted to leave this place on the last day.

Running a hotel in Spiti is not an easy feat and Deyzor is a gem which must be kept hidden cuz not everyone deserves to be here. It's not for the ones looking for luxury, room service, laundry, spa etc. It's a home away from home and the host, Karanbir is one fascinating human. He has done a remarkable job of making this gem, what it is today. As you enter through the door, you get the feel of entering someone's cozy living room.

Karan's passion & sheer hard work in running this place is so obvious in every nook & corner of this quaint little traveller's abode.

They have signs everywhere saying don't steal our books, don't steal our padlocks, don't ask for breakfast before 7.30 cos we aren't up.... and stuff like that - it felt like your Grandmother was telling you what to do.

Common areas and private rooms have some remarkable sentences painted on the wall, the fittings everywhere are finely minded.  All the service staff is friendly in an authentic way. Both the rooms and the common areas are always perfectly clean. We stayed for a week in this place (although some nights we slept in other places due to multi-day trips) and",theos_cavalleri,/Profile/theos_cavalleri,"Gironico al Monte, Italy",50
lahul_spiti,"We stayed at Hotel Deyzor, in June 2013 and were really pleased with this gem of place in Kaza. The rooms are beautifully decorated , very cosy and  spotlessly clean. The place is managed by Karanbir who is a great person and is happy to share his love and knowledge of the spectacular Spiti mountains.  I must mention that the food at the restaurant is very delicious and we were really surprised to see such a large menu. The hotel also has a small library and board games, and is a great place to meet fellow travellers.. We were there for four nights and were delighted with the cheerful and warm service from hotel staff and Karan, at all times. We whole-heartedly recommend Deyzor to all travellers.",PiyushNigam,/Profile/PiyushNigam,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",50
lahul_spiti,"Its not easy when there are heavy rains, no electricity and no hotel bookings as well when you enter Spiti but it was probably luck that we found Hotel Deyzor as we entered Kaza. We had a really long drive from Manali to Kaza and were tired. Karanbir who runs the hotel there showed us 2-3 rooms and then suggested to take a room on the top floor (saying the view is going to be awesome tomorrow morning). At that moment we were least interested about the view from the hotel or even how good the rooms were but the next morning when we woke up we were speechless to see the view from the room. It was unreal and breathtaking. We stayed there for 6 days and with each passing day we felt as if we were at home and not in a hotel.

lahul_spiti,"I warmly recommend Dayzor Resort. It was so refreshing to arrive at such a place after the long journey from Manaly. We've planned to spend there only one night but ended up staying three. It's a relatively new location yet it feels quite established. The service is superb, the atmosphere is very pleasant, and the place is decorated with many beautiful wise quotations. The rooms are clean, and the restaurant serve a great variety of foods. Karan, the owner of the place, is a very special and sweet guy, who helped us with any whims and fancies we had. He has great knowledge and practical experience of India in general, and specifically about the area of Spiti, which he's more than happy to share. So, if you find yourself in Spiti and you're looking for a high end accommodation",Adi F,/Profile/AdiF450,"Tel Aviv, Israel",50
lahul_spiti,"Great hotel! Beautiful and clean room, brilliant view of the monestry, excellent food, warm hospitality. One of the best hotels we have been to in India. We stayed with two kids in a spacious and beautifully decorated room. The oweners also gave us excellent tips for the rest of our journey. Thanks!",Sshifman,/Profile/Sshifman,"La Defense, France",50
lahul_spiti,We reached Kaza at night after a backbreaking journey and were actually looking for the HPTDC hotel when we came across Hotel Deyzor . It was suggested to me by a friend and we decided to go ahead as it looked very welcoming. Karanbir who runs the place suggested a room with a view on the top floor and we just went ahead with it. We woke up in the morning to this breathtaking view from the room!! The reasons i would go here again : 1. Clean and very spacious rooms which are reasonably priced. 2. Excellent food menu ( we never skipped breakfast.. Spanish breakfast recommended) 3. The place is sparingly but tastefully decorated. Every room sports an inspirational travel quote which is aesthetically painted on the wall. Also every room is named after one of the mountain peaks in,wanderingsoul123,/Profile/wanderingsoul123,"Mumbai, India",50
lahul_spiti,"It was great stay for me in Deyzor. Lovely, warm people, great food & clean room. What else do you need?! Karan & Cecilia are very welcoming.The location is perfect, close to the market. Some rooms on top have amazing view. Be sure you will be well looked after, they even go out of their way to take you & show things around. I will always remember my stay there.

lahul_spiti,"Hotel Deysor located in Kaza, is certainly one of the best accommodations that I have come across in the Spiti valley. Run by the outdoor adventure enthusiast Karanbir Singh, this is definitely the best place to stay if you are looking for generous comfort or seeking travel advice on things to do in and around Spiti. The hotel also offers various treks and outdoor activities on request and if you are driving around make sure to take a few handy tips from Karan. The rooms are simple, yet spacious and well lit. Deyzor has an in house restaurant too and the menu on offer is quite extensive. The quality of food served is excellent and would take you by surprise. The over all quality of 'service' is excellent and the experience starts from the moment you step inside the Deyzor and",TeamGrandOak,/Profile/TeamGrandOak,,50
lahul_spiti,"The hotel had just opened and we were one of the first guests, the rooms were large, bright and clean. It was a great place to come to after a long ride. The partners was a great source of local knowledge and they kept us busy with things to do and places to visit. They kept us posted on the condition of the road ahead to the Kunzum pass and kept tabs on us till we reached Manali. This was most reassuring. I definitely will go back again.",Mathsabraham,/Profile/Mathsabraham,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",40
lahul_spiti,We recently stayed at hotel Deysor in Kaza - Spiti valley. I must say the hotel stay and their hospitality far exceeded our expectations of the place. The owners went out of their ways to make our stay comfortable. The restaurant served multiple cuisines of the best quality. The drive up to Kaza  is very scenic and has many amazing landscape backdrops. It was nice to mingle with other guests at the hotel who came from various country. We cant wait to go back to Kaza again next year.,Amandeep777,/Profile/Amandeep777,"Melbourne, Australia",50
