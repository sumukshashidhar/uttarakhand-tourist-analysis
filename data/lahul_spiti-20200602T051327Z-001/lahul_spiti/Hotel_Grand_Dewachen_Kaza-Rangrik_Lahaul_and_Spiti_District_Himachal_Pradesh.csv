lahul_spiti,"The Meaning of Dewachen:  Dewachen is a Buddhist term for ‚Äúpure land, where body, speech and mind is one with the universe‚Äù.  Dewachen also means absolute wisdom of true happiness.   Location:  The hotel is located a few kilometers outside Kaza and on the outskirts of village Rangrik with large open vistas surrounding the hotel till one can reach the river Spiti. As a result, views of mighty Himalayan snow peaks and beautiful blue sky is available from almost all rooms. At present there are 20 rooms on the ground and first level.   The property is being expanded on second level to create few suite rooms and other facilities.  The roof of the hotel is skylight roof which makes the entire property bright all through the day making it more pleasing and lively.

lahul_spiti,"Stayed here for 3 nights with MAP plan. Hotel is about 6 km away from Kaza, just before Rangrik village. All rooms offer good view but rooms offering Spiti river view are definitely better.  Mr. Rajinder, owner of the hotel is a very contented person & very accommodating. So is Mr. Mahender, the manager - who travels extra mile to the market to fulfil any demand from the guests.  Most of the guests we met at the property were repeat visitors - that itself speaks of the hospitality & comfort the property offers. There is no disturbance of passing vehicular traffic, so sleep quality is good which is very important for hectic & tough travelling in the region. There is no tea-coffee maker in the room. No wifi as only BSNL 2G voice communication works. Lobby has a dish TV though.  ",Shailesh Dheman,/Profile/SHAILESHDHEMAN,"New Delhi, India",50
lahul_spiti,This hotel is amazing given that Kaza is remote and far off and not very well connected. The hotel is very spacious and gives a homely feel. The room was lovely and large. Our room had a direct view of the key monastery. Staff and service is as good as a five star hotel but way more warm and personal. Mr. Sunil Chettri manages the restaurant and looks after you like a mom üòä. Food is excellent. Highly recommend this hotel for Kaza tourists. ,Shital M,/Profile/ShitalM_12,,50
lahul_spiti,"This hotel is a bit off the beaten path, but it is well-worth the extra drive you will have to make to arrive at it.    When we were here we got some of the best shots of the valley, monastery, and stars of our entire trip.  You will feel like you're on another planet as day turns to night.  The food here was decent, but after a long day riding motorcycles through precarious mountain roads it will be a feast you will eagerly dive into.   The rooms are comfortable and if you're on a higher floor you may have a good opportunity to look out over the landscape and possibly see the monastery, which is only a few kilometers away.",Rezanate,/Profile/rezanate,"Los Angeles, California",40
lahul_spiti,"Grand Dewachen Earth Retreat Kaza.  A simple, cozy, traditionally built beautiful Hotel which has to be at one of the most beautiful location on Planet Earth.  The setting can't be anymore perfect.  The place Rangrik(another 6 kms ahead of Kaza into absolute beautiful wilderness), where the Hotel is located is Serene. The property is the only structure in the vast plains with Mountains in every possible shade on one side and  the Overwhelming Key Monastery to the front. The breeze in the courtyard garden flowing uninterrupted, as if tearing in into your soul to cleanse it, has to be felt to be experienced, if you know what I mean. The silence is so serene, you can have a conversation with it, the place is Magical.  The Hotel rooms are adequately spacious with traditional",Atulya Raj Sharma,/Profile/atulya2019,,40
lahul_spiti,A bit far from the main Kaza market but the view from the room is quite spectacular. You can sit by the window with a cup of green tea admiring the lunar landscape for hours. There are light fluctuations and hence were unable to shower before our early check out at 5 am. But the service and staff friendless is really genuine and warm.,khushal patel,/Profile/khushalpatel84,,40
lahul_spiti,"We were so glad that we stayed away from main Kaza during our family trip in September. Our huge comfortable room had a view of the Iconic Key monastery in the distance from one window and from the other, we saw the huge mountain with intriguing patterns and colours of gravel reflecting from the cerulean blue sky and the the snow capped Parvati Parvat beyond. This is the fist hotel i stayed where there is no obstruction between the view and me. The bed was very comfortable with khadi furnishings and kept us warm in the chilly weather. They also got us a heater since temperatures do drop at night. I wish there was a local touch of curios in the room and bathroom to give a boutique appearance. Bathroom was equipped with toiletries and a hair dryer.  The staff was always there to",BINAMumbai_India,/Profile/BINAMumbai_India,"Mumbai , India",50
lahul_spiti,"Beautiful dewachen. Very comfortable and warm as it‚Äôs designed as a greenhouse. Even the cold weather does not affect us inside because of the greenhouse style of hotel.  Comfortable big rooms with basic amenities of hot water n soap n shampoo n towel. Clean n spacious hotel overlooking the mountains n river flowing behind the hotel.  One can walk to the river bed and walk to rangrik village too.  Yum home made style food. Every meal is freshly cooked n served.  Everyone in staff are very courteous n Friendly n helpful. Giving us good guidance  to venture around Kaza.  Very impressed with the owner ,Mr. Bodh, As he was Always informative n helpful n kind.

lahul_spiti,"First of all, this place does charge you a bomb and the facilities provided may not be appropriate to the amount being charged.  However, having said that, we loved our stay here since the staff were always on their toes to cater to our needs.  Also, the rooms are neat and clean and the bathroom is also decently spacious.    This property is about 5 kms ahead of the Kaza town and hence makes for a very quiet and quaint stay.  The view from the rooms is magnificent and one cannot ask for more.  The food provided is excellent, however, they did serve us cold and tasteless meal once during our stay of 4 nights.  The fact that they were apologetic about the same and made up for it during the rest of our stay, means that they care for the comfort of their guests.

lahul_spiti,This was the highlight of our trip and so was this hotel. Its this solitary building amongst snow capped mountains. You can see Key and Kibber in the distance and Rangrik village.

lahul_spiti,"This property is an absolute treat in itself!  Instead of staying at Kaza ,we stayed at Rangrik just 5 minutes away.This property has beautiful big mountains as the backdrop.Key monastary is clearly visible.There are fields through which one can amble along.  The rooms felt new,were clean  and are done in the tibetan style....wooden panels throughout and a low seating which doubles as an extra bed.The panels insulate the room and keep you cosy even as you hear the wind howl outside early morning.The staff is warm and courteous and get you your early morning cuppa in the comfort of your room as you get ready for another day.

lahul_spiti,"A little ahead of Kaza, near a village called Rangrik, on the banks of Spiti river, in the midst of wild flowers stands this Grand Dewachen retreat that can provide you the best luxury possible in this remote Himalayan valley.   Mud building designed pretty much using local architecture and material is done aesthetically with an intricately carved front door.   Staff is extremely friendly and would guide you for local site seeing and for trekking routes. They will serve you the food that you need at that height to keep you warm. Do try their Thukpa and their roasted wheat snack.   Rooms are luxurious and rooms on one side come with a view of Key Monastery.",IndiTales,/Profile/IndiTales,"Goa, India",40
lahul_spiti,"We were doing a road trip and needed to stay a night. For 100+ Km on both directions, there is not a property like this. Nicely done rooms with all the facilities and a nice clean loo. The area has hardly any electricity and yet they manage so well. The owner Rajinder is very courteous and helpful. Since the roads were blocked, the pumps had run dry and he managed to arrange some fuel for us. There are no phone connections and only BSNL works and he kindly helped each of us connect back home. Mahender from his staff was also so kind and helpful.   It is expensive. But when you realize where is it situated, one can appreciate the need to price it that way.",Anchit G,/Profile/917anchitg,"Noida, India",50
lahul_spiti,"The hotel is situated at a very isolated place, you will find no establishment in your line of sight except for the awesome view of Key Monastery. Very calm place except for the sound of the blowing wind. Very clean, spacious and well furnished rooms, and almost 100% power back, which is very rare in this part of the world. Very tasty homely food with some great hospitality shown by the manager and the owner. The manager accompanied us to guide us through the places to be visited in Kaza, which was a very nice gesture.",Megha G,/Profile/TravellerMegs2014,Delhi,50

Our room was facing Kee Gompa. An exceptional view! We had to leave extremely early. Nevertheless, a warm breakfast was cooked for us at 5am with generous ""sandwiches"" and fruits to go!

lahul_spiti,"We stayed here a couple weeks ago. Its important to keep things in perspective - Spiti Valley is a remote place with very limited and basic infrastructure. With that in mind, I have to say this hotel is excellent!!!  The location offers superb views of Spiti Valley, and Key monastery in particular! The rooms are spacious and comfortable, the bathroom and shower were great to clean up and relax after a tiring day of sight-seeing and driving.  The food was pretty good, they had prepared western dishes as they had a large group of Americans and Canadians staying at the hotel.   They also had an enjoyable cultural program in the evening with locals singing and dancing, and then they made the guests join in as well.  The staff were very helpful and courteous, and the owner Mr.",SVSAbuDhabi,/Profile/SVSAbuDhabi,Abu Dhabi,50
lahul_spiti,"Amidst the spectacular isolation of Spiti, somewhere between Kaza and Rangrik on the Spiti Manali highway lies this property that stands out in its surroundings. I was reading the reviews of others which were critical of the property and while I would agree with the points they made, personally we loved our stay here. Spectacular views of the Ki Monastery somewhere far away surrounded by quiet vast isolation we sat on its terrace and watched the sun go down and a full moon appear in all its glory behind one of the tall ranges surrounding this valley. The manager Mahender and his young staff were warm and efficient. It would not be fair to compare their service standards and the finish of the property with the city properties but despite the small inconveniences we would still",adhru,/Profile/adhru,Mumbai,40
lahul_spiti,"Despite being in the middle of nowhere, more than 5km from Kaza but with unobstructed commanding views of Ki Monastery, this new property could have been a very nice hotel, provided finishings had been taken care of before the hotel opened and the staff had been properly trained and managed. Unfortunately none of this was the case. Just to mention a few of the issues I faced: some of the lights did not work; water trickled in the sink, making it unusable; except for one day, hot water did not run so I needed to wash with a mug and a bucket; beds were just as hard as in Tabo; window insolation was non-existent and hooks to keep windows opened had been forgotten; my room was not made on the first day because housekeeping didn‚Äôt have a copy of the room keys and I was supposed to",FrenchTraveller001,/Profile/FrenchTraveller001,"Paris, France",20

lahul_spiti,I was at the Grand Dewachen last month and stayed for 4 days. Completely impressed with the staff the facilities and the service. Very homely staff and great hospitality. It is a completely new property and has all comforts unexpected in a place like Kaza/Rangrik. The property has magnificent view of the Kee Monastery and is located a bit far away from Kaza. However the location is very peaceful and ideal for small excursions around Kaza,niketa_desai,/Profile/niketa_desai,"Ahmedabad, India",50
