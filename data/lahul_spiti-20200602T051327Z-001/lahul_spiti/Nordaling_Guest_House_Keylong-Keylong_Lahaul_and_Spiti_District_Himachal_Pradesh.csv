lahul_spiti,"The six of us were there at Nordaling in early June. The best part of the place is its location and kitchen area. The cooks get a five star. Thupka and chow must be tried! The rooms are good and have a view... The staff is hard working. The owner is a good chap... He even came to see us off early next morning at 6, when we were to leave for Leh! The place is a good stop for bikers. They have around 6 rent accommodations as well for the solo, frugal traveler. The guest house is close to the DC residence and has some good walks to the bazaar and odd shops. The whole of keylong is a beauty and the people there take pride in it... And put in equal measure of efforts to keep it so. Plastic is a no. They have fines for littering... It's a must see and stay!",Sunanda B,/Profile/Tina_tube,"New Delhi, India",40

lahul_spiti,"My friends and i were in Keylong at end of September 2017. An acquaintance had recommended the place being reviewed. We only had our meals here and can vouch for them and recommend them to everybody. Though the Menu may not seem too large but has enough variety and choice for all. The food is deciduous, freshly cooked, non-oily and portions generous. Perhaps the best place in Keylong. And its very clean and simple. The best part of the meals were freshly prepared delicious unadulterated pure apple juice from freshly plucked apples from their garden right in front of you !.   The staff is very courteous, polite and helpful and will do their best to give you a good meal.  Not to be missed if in Keylong",junglebabbler,/Profile/junglebabbler,"New Delhi, India",50

lahul_spiti,Once you cross Rohtang and go over the other side the picturesque and barren terrain welcomes you to Lahaul and Spiti district. Keylong being the first and major town will offer you with plenty of hotels. Nordaling Hotel is located close to the old bus stand of Keylong and around 1 km from the Manali Leh highway. The hotel has 3 floors and an adjoined dining area in the open. The rooms are average in terms of space and the stairs are narrow. But the views from the rooms are good and the sunset and sunrise can be enjoyed. Beware there is a small climb to the hotel for big vehicles but nothing major to be worried about. Food is decent and served from their own kitchen. The owner of the hotel is very courteous and so are the other staff. Recommended for Keylong,Ratno_Ghosh,/Profile/Ratno_Ghosh,"Kolkata, India",40

lahul_spiti,"My parents went to keylong few days back and they stayed in this hotel for two nights.   The staffs are amazing. They are polite, helpful and keep the property very neat and clean. The rooms are comfortable and the hotel is actually built within green fields of vegetables and fruits, and on the backdrop you have mountains.   The food is also very good and affordable. Overall this is a nice budget hotel in Keylong.",Anindya1987,/Profile/Anindya1987,"Jamshedpur, India",50

lahul_spiti,"In a small Himalayan town nestled high among the lower Himalayan range, a traveller would not expect much by way of luxurious stay. For the traveller who comes to Keylong by road from Leh, any place to rest one's head which is warm, will do. This hotel is definitely better than what we expected when we rode into Keylong at 02:00 in the morning after a gruelling 300 kilometre long ride from Tso Moriri. At that time we had just about enough energy to change and crash into the bed. However, we noted that even when woken up at that odd time, with the outside temperatures in low single digits, the staff were happy to show us to our rooms, take in our luggage and arrange for water etc. They did not show any discomfort in being woken up at that odd time. A few of us even ordered",Darnie Christopher,/Profile/DarnieChristopher,"Mumbai, India",30
