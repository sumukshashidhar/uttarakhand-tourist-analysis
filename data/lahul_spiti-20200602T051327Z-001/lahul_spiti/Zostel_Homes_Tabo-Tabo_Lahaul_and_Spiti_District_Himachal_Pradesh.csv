lahul_spiti,"Happy Vibes! What a warm hospitality we received in harsh winter-19Â°. The most comfortable and happy stay it was. Host is so loving and caring that he served food with dollops of ghee on it by himself. Super clean rooms, washrooms, more than enough water, food on time and extremely cooperative, helping hosts. What else one can ask for? Felt like home.. Visiting in Summer again!  Love and Wishes. Sunaina.",Sunaina Holey,/Profile/Sunainaah,,50
