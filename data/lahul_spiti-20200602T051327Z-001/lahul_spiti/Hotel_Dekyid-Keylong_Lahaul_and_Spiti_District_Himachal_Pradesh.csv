The rooms are basic, but clean and comfortable, with views to soak in.  The level of personal attention from the staff was spot on being pitched at just the right level. Food was good.  There is not a lot to do in Keylong as it is very much a transit town, though wondering around both in the afternoon and early the next morning there was a very friendly feel to the town. I popped into a Dhaba at 7.00 in the morning and got a great chai!!",glen077,/Profile/glen077,"Reeth, United Kingdom",50

Hotel Dekyid is pathetic. We paid 1500 per room for 2 rooms which were shabby and filthy.

lahul_spiti,"One cant find a 3,4,5 star hotel this town as this place is a small town also not accessible for outside world for almost half the year; so given the scenario one shouldn't expect more also the room tariff is very low but do charge more depending on the situation. After looking many hotels in  keylong we found this Hotel best among the other Hotel for many reasons this Hotel is placed little away from local crowd at the edge of the town giving the best view from the room and common balcony; staff are also very friendly, room maintenance is also fairly good in comparison one cant expect more in this town; although the hotel had just openedup for this year season after the road to Rohtang Pass was opened, so we were the first couple of guest so Hotel restaurant was not operation,",Vittal Yadav,/Profile/vittal_yadav,"Bangalore, India",50
lahul_spiti,"For an out-of-way town, the best place to stay in Keylong is the Hotel Dekyid. We checked out most of the other places in town. The staff were extremely helpful. I had left my adaptor plug in Leh and one of the staff volunteered to go to the bazaar and he found me one. The rooms are roomy with great views. The owner/manager Nawang Barongpa is a very interesting, well-informed man. We very much enjoyed talking about India and Lahaul with him.",Jaanki,/Profile/Jaanki,"Victoria, Canada",40
lahul_spiti,"Excellent; after scourging makemytrip.com (my ""trusted"" travel advisor"") for a potential hotel, I finally decided on Hotel dekyid- a choice that I lived to celebrate throughout my stay. Right from the first courtesy call with Mr Sherab, to the well-appointed room, the multi-cuisine food, and the 24/7 room-service; the place had it all and more. In fact, the entire staff was extremely courteous and gave us a royal treatment. What's more, Mr. Sherab even allowed us to stay on in the hotel at 4 PM; much beyond the official check-out time of 9 AM, so that we could spend the day peacefully without kiiling our time before taking our bus- a gesture that speaks very high of the standards that the Dekyid staff adhere to. Of given a chance, I would love to be there again! Just to add that",virenderbodh,/Profile/virenderbodh,delhi,50
