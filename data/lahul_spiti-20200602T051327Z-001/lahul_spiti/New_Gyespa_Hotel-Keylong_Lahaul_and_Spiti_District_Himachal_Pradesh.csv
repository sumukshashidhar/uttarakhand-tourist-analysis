lahul_spiti,"We stayed here for a night. Clean room. The food was excellent. The owner is courteous. A great experience! A bus stand near the hotel. Gives a good view of the surrounding majestic mountains. Nothing much to be done here. Ideal hotel for folks passing through Rohtang Pass, staying here for a night and going back to Manali or forward to Leh",Sunil G,/Profile/388sunilg,Mumbai,40

lahul_spiti,Old furniture and the rooms are not tidy. Needs a lot of maintenance. Restaurant looked good but food taste was average. You can surely get a much better hotel at this price. They have parking facility available in case you want to stop over for your leh trip.,Varun Wadhwa,/Profile/varunwadhwa2019,Delhi,30
lahul_spiti,"We stayed here on 29 & 30-Sep-2015. We booked three double bed rooms. Rooms are very good, clean and spacious. Bathrooms are spacious and clean.  Food in the restaurant is very good specially chinese. Stuffs are good. This property is just beside the Keylong bus stand. Highly recommendable.",Saikat B,/Profile/Saikatbabai,"Kolkata, India",50
lahul_spiti,"We stayed for one night here, on our way to Manali from Leh. We took the balcony rooms which provide a very good view of the mountains nearby. The rooms were decent and the food was good. Overall, a value-for-money hotel.",jyoti_the_wanderer,/Profile/jyoti_the_wanderer,"Mumbai, India",40
lahul_spiti,"We had to find a place to crash in Keylong, so this seemed better than the other available options. Room was ok but bathroom was not good. Bucket was dirty, flush wasn't working properly. We got one towel on demand. They did not offer on their own. Food however was good. In all, a very average property, but staff was polite and considerate.",JainSakshi11,/Profile/JainSakshi11,"New Delhi, India",30
lahul_spiti,This is basically a B&B. Its cleaner than most other properties. Food is decent. Has a wine shop right next door that can serve alcohol in hotel's restaurant. Neat and clean otherwise. Cannot complain for the price.,imvvirgo,/Profile/imvvirgo,"Faridabad, India",30
lahul_spiti,"the rooms are just ok. dont expect much in terms of any facilities. no towels/ soaps available in the room. aim is to save on them if the customer does not ask for it. upon being asked for a soap we were handed over 1/2 of smallest (Rs. 10) lifeboy soap, handed 1 towel and told we hope you dont need another one. We left our expensive Nike pyjama there while traveling to Leh and they did not bother to give satisfactory answer about sending it over even after repeated calls.. Luckily we decided to return through the same route and colleccted it ourselves.. But the pyjama was not in the hotel, they send somebody to get it from some other place. Again the intention was to keep it rather return it.. Decide for yourself..",Gautam_12,/Profile/Gautam_12,delhi,10
lahul_spiti,"It was mid Jun when we visited Keylong. On 14th jun we started at 5:40AM from hotel Beas (HPTDC) Manali, and reached at Keylong at around 14:45. Our booking was at New Gyespa Hotel. I did no mistake, this place is really awesome! Rooms were good, view from balcony was excellent! room & toilet was very clean. Food was so so but prompt service and we got whatever we demanded. The hotel owner Mr. Jagan Karpa is an excellent person. My wife was suffering from altitude sickness. Mr Jagan helped us by taking us to the only available Govt. dispensary (small hospital). Doctor & nurse there were helpful too. After some simple medicines she was alright next morning. I was suggested that we should have stayed atleast two days at Manali to avoid such sickness. Rest of our tour was",parthanpc,/Profile/parthanpc,"Surat, India",50
lahul_spiti,"We stayed at this hotel for one night. Keylong was an overnight halt for us and we were supposed to take the state transport bus out the next morning. This made us look for accommodation near the bus stand. Walking up the road from the bus stand, this is the second hotel you see, and arguably the best one near the bus stand.  The rooms are clean, well equipped, and have well maintained attached toilets and bathroom with hot water. If you need to stay near the bus stand, save yourself some time and simply pick this one, even if it is a couple of hundred rupees costlier than others.",milindvk,/Profile/milindvk,Bangalore,40
lahul_spiti,"We took a halt for a night at New Gespa hotel from our Leh to Manali road trip.  The hotel has all the amenities a tired traveller would crave for. A plus for the people who travel by bus as its located at the Keylong bus stand.  The food is nice, the rooms are big and clean, the beds are comfortable, hot water to our aid, all in all it has all the comforts.  The staff is very accommodating. They even tendered to our early breakfast need however at a whooping price. But with a word with the manager/ Owner, it was taken care of. Must say the guy was very nice.  All in all, the best place to rest in Keylong.",Shruti2523,/Profile/Shruti2523,"New Delhi, India",40
lahul_spiti,"We came after 10 hrs of journey to be received by staff pleasantly. They have prepared our room well before and handed keys as soon as we enter. View from room was great. Rooms were clean/Spacious. Washrooms were also very clean with hot running water. Overall, good stay.",Sauank,/Profile/Sauank,"New Delhi, India",50
lahul_spiti,"Stayed here for a night in June '14 while on way from Leh via Tso Moriri to Manali.  Economically priced, the room was good enough for a night's halt. It is located just next to Keylong's bus station. The staff was very helpful and courteous.   The food here definitely needs a lot of improvement. The dinner that I had ordered left a lot to be desired.",Ricky,/Profile/Ricky_DEL_LON_HKG,"Hong Kong, China",30
lahul_spiti,"This hotel ""New Gyespa"" is just beside bus stand of Keylong. We traveled along with my family and my friends family in second week of June, 2013. When we arrived Keylong (from Manali) in the afternoon after a hectic journey and our driver told us that ""this is your hotel"", we were bit disappointed seeing the front side of the hotel (since new construction work was going on). But when we saw the hotel bedroom and balcony we were very satisfied. Room was very clean. From backside balcony wide mountain range was seen, wonderful scenic beauty.  Service and Food quality  was very good.",pinaki b,/Profile/124pinakib,"Kolkata, India",40
lahul_spiti,"We been there during August, 2013.. This place is awesome place to stay.. Price is very reasonable, service is very prompt and good. The rooms which are mountain facing,  gives an awesome view of the nearest mountains.  Overall excellent place to stay...",Shilpi_Dutta,/Profile/Shilpi_Dutta,"Bengaluru, India",50
