It is situated between Baralacha La to the south and Lachungla La  to the north, at an altitude of 4,290 m (14,070 ft).  “The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes……..Marcel Proust It is indeed a strange when photographers go to a same destination but each one comes back with different images. I surprised myself by noticing these rocks near Sarchu which I must have passed at least six times but never noticed them earlier. I suppose I was carrying new eyes this time!",Arunverma,/Profile/Arunverma,"Amritsar, India",50
