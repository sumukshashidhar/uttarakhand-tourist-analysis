lahul_spiti,"The property location is unbeatable - adjacent to the brilliant Bhaga river flowing down the valley in the face of the mighty Himalayas. It is an extremely picturesque place, the most beautiful aspect of this property. There are 2 building complexes in the property (G+2 structures) with rooms, and around with 5-6 tent accommodations also available in the sprawling gardens of the property. The rooms and the bathrooms are large and spacious. However, cleanliness can be improved, we saw a few insects in the rooms. Also, the door knob of one of the rooms was dangling, almost came out. While there were flat screen TVs in the rooms, the signal wasn't working in one of the sets.

lahul_spiti,"We had a booking elsewhere, but we got late in reaching Jispa, thanks to well-known traffic jams at Rohtang Pass. However, that was a blessing in disguise! While searching for our place, we almost crossed entire Jispa (phones not working, so can't contact previous booking person). Returning back to Jispa came across Padma Lodge and we were lucky to find 2 rooms for our stay here.   Jispa isn't a place where you'll get luxury so if you are expecting that, please don't travel to remote mountain areas. Even then, what we got a Padma Lodge was more than satisfactory! Nice clean rooms with clean bathrooms! As it was night, we dumped our stuff and headed straight for dinner. All meals are served in common area. The food was superb!

We ordered some food specially without spices. One particular dish, yellow dal was decaying and yet was served hot. We had to spit it immediately and reported to the staff. He disagreed that it was many days old. Yet all through the arguments he never tasted it himself.  Seems this was off season and they thought they can get away by serving garbage on a plate. He later even billed that item and led to another argument. We paid the the bill only after he removed that item. We had doubts on all the other items we had eaten since the hotel policy itself was allowing stale food.

lahul_spiti,Basically Jispa is a transit place for Leh Manali route. But we stayed there for 2 days for relaxing purpose. And it is worth for the said purpose. Padma Lodge is situated just beside Chandra river and you can easily walk to the bank of the river. Hospitality was awesome. Rooms are quite big and all sorts of modern amenities was there except WiFi. Food quality at its best. Staffs are always there to help you.

The place is very near to the Bhaga river - it was dark by the time we were ready to go the banks. Thanks to our guide from the lodge, we enjoyed a moonlit view of the river!

After a few jigs of camping, it was great to stay in a 'proper' hotel.  The canteen style restaurant is perfectly good and it was a luxury to order a plate of chips and a toasted sandwich in the afternoon after checking in.  Breakfast was good with plenty of tasty choices.  A brief stay, but certainly recommended..  My ratings are based on typical and comparative hotels in the area.  I can't comment on the value as the hotel was booked by our tour manager.",Ken W,/Profile/KenW309,"Burgess Hill, United Kingdom",40
lahul_spiti,"On the basis that the car journey from Leh to Manali is too arduous for a single day of travelling (which we think is correct), then you'll end up with the need to overnight somewhere between those two locations and Jispa is undoubtedly the best option.  Padma Lodge is actually two properties, with the newer property being utilised until there are no rooms available, at which point the older property opens.   Having tried alternatives to Padma Lodge in Jispa, we can confirm that it is the best place around, however, the place isn't really that great - merely adequate and definitely much better than the tourist 'glamping' sites that are appearing in abundance throughout the valley.",scud56,/Profile/scud56,"Royal Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom",30

We had selected super deluxe room. The first sight of  building sort of confirmed our fears of one more  mediocre stay ! For super deluxe rooms they have a separate building few meters away and when we reached there, we were pleasantly surprised to see the spacious rooms with beautiful view of mountains and river, bathroom was also quite big with hot running water and cleanliness was also of acceptable standards!

Positives at Padma Lodge - large parking space, proximity to the river (fast flowing and probably dangerous but worth going down to) and open spaces for a campfire. Negatives - creaking floors - every time the guys in the room upstairs moved it seemed like a herd of elephants was moving around. The dining room is away from the block which has the rooms and you need to be prepared for really chilly winds when you walk across for dinner. ",Manoj S,/Profile/ManojS2486,"New Delhi, India",30

If you are coming from Ladakh to Manali the advantage with the Hotel is it is at a point around 90 Km in towards Manali and the road condition is good so it helps to cut down your travel time the following day.

A hot shower after a long journey is most refreshing.   Staff was helpful and courteous. We reached post dinner timings, yet they served hot dinner for us.

lahul_spiti,"Padma Lodge hosted us enroute Manali to Leh by road. Located alongside Bhaga river, the property is well located and has hospitable and helpful staff ,clean and fresh food priced reasonably to suit budget travel. Rooms in the 2 buildings are also well priced though they can keep them cleaner. Reservation was easy .We stayed in the building which has Balcony on each floor with a view of the mountain across. Tents are quite neat and modern. Plenty of space for Parking.Beautiful location for walks on the riverbed and nearby Gompa & Village School. Rooms hv Satellite TV n hot water. Views from the back side of Dining Hall are very relaxing..  We were 9 of us and we had a good time staying at Padma Lodge. Will stay again if we do this route again.",rajivchhabra,/Profile/rajivchhabra,"Nagpur, India",40
lahul_spiti,"Located on the way from Leh to Manali, and right on the road, the lodge is nice and clean. The resaturant is in a separate building, good tasty food. The rooms are in two separate buildings, one next to the restaurant, with double rooms on the ground floor, and the other right on the road, with two floors, all with nice clean showers, each had its own boiler, which was turned on, so hot water was ready. the river flows right nixt to the premises, I saw some big tents with facilities as well, these are more expensive than the built rooms.The only draw-back is the proximity of the road and its noises.",Bhutantraveller,/Profile/Bhutantraveller,"Amsterdam, Holland",40
lahul_spiti,"We stayed at the Padma lodge tents. We loved them. The tents were big with attached toilets. The bed was comfortable. Linens and towels were very clean. The staff was highly motivated. Food was, to our surprise, very tasty. It is located just a few minutes from the banks of the river Bhaga. One must book in advance because there are very few options in Jispa and tents/hotels run full.",rajab23,/Profile/rajab23,"Kolkata, India",50
lahul_spiti,"Padma lodge (hotel) is located in a very small place called Jispa, which is surrounded by huge mountains all around. Jispa is a small village which comes on the way between leh and Manali.   The lodge has both options..... Deluxe tent stay as well as rooms. To our surprise the lodge was awesome better than most of the 3 star hotels that we stayed in during our trip.   Rooms were huge and very clean. Linen and towels were all very very clean. Food was awesome and the service  by the staff was very nice. The owner and his team were very friendly and helpful.   Highly recommended place to stay on our way to leh or Manali.   Thanks  Anisha.",Anisha D,/Profile/anishad_12,"Mumbai, India",40
lahul_spiti,"We stayed in the Safari Tents for 2 nights in Jispa on route to Leh from Manali. The camp is simple and we reached with absolutely no expectations. However, the courteous and ever helpful staff made our stay very comfortable. The location is quite good, on the main highway just about 1.5 km from the village and a walking distance to the river. 1 of the staff members was our guide on the day after our arrival and took us on a great trek. Kids enjoyed crossing the river on the chain pulley carriage. The food was simple yet delicious. While we were told that at this altitude (11000 ft) usually you dont have an appetite, we were all eating quite well. Definately choose the tents over the rooms. The tents have an attached loo with running Hot water which is a major plus and you won't",Ghost71,/Profile/Ghost71,"New Delhi, India",50
