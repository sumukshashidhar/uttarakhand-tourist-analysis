lahul_spiti,"Losar is off the beaten track and therefore, such a lovely place as The Nomad's Cottage is least expected here. The cottage is a lovely specimen of local architecture with a traditional dining room and beautifully appointed rooms. The hosts Kishore and Vishal are great guys with a lovely sense of humor and excellent culinary skills. If Losar then TNC.",cool_dube,/Profile/cool_dube,"Bengaluru, India",50
lahul_spiti,"Do not visit this place with kids or on a leisure. The place is nice overall but their geysers in the bathroom have uneven heating, sometimes just super cold water comes from all taps or just super hot water from all taps, like burning hot!! Without any warning, suddenly all taps had v hot water and i suffered a first degree burn due to this. My stay was completely ruined.  There was no proper staff when we visited too.  Out of our entire spiti trip, this was the only place i didnt like at all. Losar as a village is quiet and beautiful, but u can avoid staying here. Easily avoidable.

lahul_spiti,"From the greetings of the local staff to the Glass rooms, Nomads's cottage is a heaven in disguise. Even at an altitude of more than 13000 feet, Palzor and Guru Ji manage the place really efficiently. The Glass rooms are a must to stay in, if you want to sleep to the stars and wake up to the gorgeous Spiti Valley. Surprisingly,the cottage is built in such a way that is intrinsically warm and I could do with only a comforted even in the month of April. A must visit :D",Jatin Ahuja,/Profile/wildernama,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
lahul_spiti,Losar is the coldest village in Himachal Pradesh. We stayed there for a night and got the experience of a lifetime. The temperature was at sub zero and water pipelines were frozen. Hats off to the staff who had carried water for us from quite a far distance. Their hospitality at that coldest place make our stay quite warm. Specially the all paratha at morning was a treat. Try to book the glass room from which you can see the entire mountain range crystal clear. A wonderful place to stay and enjoy nature at its best.,Amrita2983,/Profile/Amrita2983,"Kolkata, India",50
lahul_spiti,"We stayed at their Ground Floor room, which is their warmest. At the time of our travel, the temperature at night ranged between -15 to - 20 degrees Celsius and the day temperature even at 9 in the morning was about  - 7 degrees.   At this location (altitude 3950 metres) and in such extreme weather conditions, Nomad's Cottage took excellent care of us. The room was so nice and warm that the temperature inside the room even at night was about 5-10 degrees. The boys gave us 2 hot water bags each to keep us warm and gave us extra blankets as well. The room was very nice and clean and comfortable. As the water in the pipelines had all frozen up, they gave us hot water in buckets, on demand.

lahul_spiti,This was among the best stays in the area. The glass rooms have amazing views. The food was home like and the staff was friendly. They have water heaters and a heater in the common room so we were kept warm and cozy. A great place for star gazing in the night sky. Its in close proximity to Kunjam pass and Chandrataal lake as well.,Roam829848,/Profile/Roam829848,,50
lahul_spiti,We did a full Spiti circuit from Shimla to Manali. Instead of staying in Kaza we chose this place. And I'm glad we stayed at nomad. Very nice rooms with a great view all around. Nice and helpful staff. Paradise for photography and hiking. Very comfortable stay. I'll highly recommend this place. ,ipilot320,/Profile/ipilot320,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
lahul_spiti,I booked glass room which has beautiful view. All of our guys were down with altitude sickness and the hotel staff helped us to get well from the sickness. They served good food.

lahul_spiti,"Do NOT go the outhouse arranged by the management unless in really dire straits. If the main building is full opt for another home stay or opt out of the property.   We had a horrible experience.  Lousy rooms, bad lighting, bugs in the rooms and no running water. On top of it overcharged for it. Only saving grace were the boys who helped in what so ever way they could.",2105bimal,/Profile/2105bimal,"Chandigarh, India",10
lahul_spiti,"The Nomad's Cottage is the best place to stay in all respect. The mountain view is the best from the front side room of the cottage. The Corner room is having full glass windows on west and north side from where you can see the sunset. We stayed there on full moonlight day at that time the moon was also visible more than 4 hours from room. The staff is very cooperative, the food provided by the staff is also very tasty. They also provide the local food.",kschouhan,/Profile/kschouhan,"Jaipur, India",50
lahul_spiti,"Its almost a year after I am writing this review, but it was pending in my books since I came back from this memorable journey. Absolutely THE PLACE you look for in a beautiful village of Himalayas, NOMAD'S is the name. Sahil and Leena, both were so friendly and helped me all the way for planning this trip. I travelled with my small family (Me/Wife and 2 kids) and was quite inquisitive about my stays & driving conditions. Nomad's team made it simple and enjoyable. I still remember the warm welcome by a Giant (Sorry Sahil:) and then the rules of the house. Time spent with GuruJi, Yayaati and rest of Nomad's team is unforgettable. I just loved the Glass rooms (thanks Leena, Not Sahil :), that made my entire stay to be rated super best from best. Good homely food, sharaab sessions",Ravi B,/Profile/ravib132,,50

lahul_spiti,"Losar is the last village in Spiti valley, before one crosses the Kunzum pass over into Lahaul. Not only are the surroundings beautiful, but it is also a great base to visit Chandrataal from, if you don't want to camp out near the lake.  As of now, The Nomad's Cottage is the only place in Losar that you can book online.  It is a two-storey house situated on the outskirts of the village, on the same road as the Government rest house. The interiors are really cosy - with ceilings of logs and interlaced twigs, prints and photographs on the walls, and furnished with Tibetan rugs and low, lacquered tables. The dining area had a closed iron stove in the centre, to keep the room warm. All bedrooms have attached western-style bathrooms.  It is hard work to run a place like this.",tanuka_dutta,/Profile/tanuka_dutta,"Bengaluru, India",40
lahul_spiti,"Before talking about Nomads Cottage, I will talk about underrated but one of the most beautiful village Losar of Spiti Valley. It has its own charm & beauty. Calm serene and out of world experience. Most of people do not keep Losar in their Spiti Itinerary. This has kept Losar less commercialized and untouched beauty.  Last Year while creating our spiti itiniary I wanted to stay away from commercialized places or too crowded areas. Except Mudh Village I opted for Losar Village stay and choose Nomad’s cottage for our stay.  We stayed there for three nights and were really memorable. The Nomad’s Cottage is one of the best properties in Spiti, no doubt about it.   The comfort, cosiness while keeping local aesthetics intact is world class. The Caretaker’s team is amazing.

lahul_spiti,Losar is a small village with only basic facilities. But this is an outstanding place in the village. In such a context it can be called traveler's paradise.. We loved this place and the views from the rooms were super great...   The guys at the hotel made sure that we are happy during our stay. Even when we left early morning before breakfast they gave coupen for breakfast at chandratal.. from their camps.. Dont miss this place.. stay here for a day or two.. the village is also awsome..,Philip_febz,/Profile/Philip_febz,"New Delhi, India",50
lahul_spiti,"The first village in Spiti while coming down from Rohtang & Kunzum La, Losar has a population of 120 souls. Nomad's Cottage is the best possible accommodation that one can expect at such a remote location. Ankit, Mohit and their team took good care of us. It is highly commendable how they manage to run a property in such a remote location. The food is basic but wholesome. Would definitely recommend this as the only place to stay West of Kaza.",YatinWadhwana,/Profile/YatinWadhwana,Gurgaon,40
lahul_spiti,"An unbelievable picture perfect place. Breathtaking for people who like to be just in the lap of mother nature. The property though basic but really well done. The glass rooms were amazing with fab view. Sahil, the owner if there keeps great company and entertains very well with his stories. Ankit, tomorrow's photographer is good to connect with too. Though a bit shy but very friendly once gets comfortable. Guruji or the Don as called on the property is very warm and a great handy man. Overall would love to go back with atleast 4 nights stay. Food too was very nice but lacked variety & readiness for special cuisine requirements. Understandable due to nature of location & resource available.",Nimish Z,/Profile/nimish25,"Mumbai, India",50
lahul_spiti,"what do i say about this cozy place tucked in the Spiti valley and the last outpost before Kunzum la....we overstayed at the place (cancelled other bookings) ... the excellent hospitality. the homely atmosphere...the lazy and tiring walks (we did Kunzom top)...the night skies, the milky way .... the list goes on and on.... we for sure are returning to Losar a few more times....highly recommended and a must visit place....",Ramesh957,/Profile/Ramesh957,Bangalore,50
lahul_spiti,"Losar was the last point on the road we could stay at since Kunzum La was still closed. And the Nomad's Cottage was the perfect place to stay in! Traditional, comfortable, beautifully done and great service. There's hills all around, and a smaller stream and the Spiti river just 5 minutes' walk from the cottage. And then it snowed, and everything turned white!   The 'solar rooms' with large windows are lovely to soak in the sun all afternoon, with pretty views through them. And the living/dining area with the stove fighting the cold to keep things warm is a perfect place to spend long evenings with friends or the family, or just reading a book.",Sameer S,/Profile/743sameers,Bangalore,50
lahul_spiti,This is a place I'm yearning to repeat in 2017. It's a place to meet your inner sanctorum and be at peace with yourself. The hues of the blues that I saw in the sky are still to be seen anywhere else in the world. The rooms were super comfortable and Nobu our caretaker was the man! Had a wonderful bonfire at night and completely loved the experience and food! Kudos to the owner and his team!  ,Sameersharma16,/Profile/Sameersharma16,"New Delhi, India",50
lahul_spiti,"It was my first time living in a cottage. We were a group of 11. And the rooms on the ground floor were interconnected. It was fun just roaming around in each other's rooms.  The most attractive thing for me was the dining area. It was right next to the kitchen so you can get the hot food instantly as it comes out of the kitchen well prepared. That area also had a heating stove. It's pure heaven sitting beside it in winter evenings.  The food was simple and tasty, just like home. The hospitality is wonderful as it is just a small group of locals running the place.",yash b,/Profile/909yashb,"Vadodara, India",50
lahul_spiti,a very well designed and well maintained cottage in the middle of nowhere just to make you relax and forget about everything. Thankyou Sahil Desai & Guruji for making my solo spiti trip absolutely wonderful. Still cant imagine how could such an amazing place be created in such a remote location.

When we started planning for the trip, Nomads cottage was our first booking and reason was - Mr. Sahil Duggal(owner of property)and his friendly attitude . He cleared our lot of doubts regarding the road conditions, weather and places to be covered. When we reached there, I found the the same friendly attitude is reflected in his staff as well . Food options are limited given the amenities available at lossar  but the way staff serves it in kitchen will definitely make you happy.Rooms are clean and well maintained .No words for location - As when you are spiti everything is beautiful .

Losar is at a high altitude (4098 mtrs), so if not well prepared the oxygen depreciation does get to you and would take at least 2 days to get used to.  The hosts Leena and Sahil are extremely welcoming and share a lot of tips to help make the stay memorable.   The food served by Kunga Bhaiya is excellent and most of my time went in eating! If you ask you will also be served local cuisines so do ask.  The rooms are very well kept and have a very homely feel. The kitchen is a meeting point for most and many new friends are made around it. ",RoyIshan,/Profile/RoyIshan,"New Delhi, India",50
lahul_spiti,"Mesmerizing is the most apt word to describe my stay at the Nomad's Cottage.   Firstly, I would like to clarify that the Nomad's Cottage is not in Manali but in a small hamlet by the name Lossar, some 130 kms from Manali (12 hrs drive). The picturesque Kunzum pass is around 19 kms from Lossar, which is why the Nomad's Cottage acts as a perfect stop-over for people going towards Manali or Chandratal.  But, staying there made me realize that it is much more than a stop over. Surrounded by beautiful snow clad mountains, the set up is just picture perfect. The kind of facilities made available at such a remote location is really commendable. The staff is very courteous and helpful. The rooms are neat, clean and picturesque.  All in all, we had a great time there.",Rohan J,/Profile/rohanj995,"Mumbai, India",50
