lahul_spiti,"we went to Tabo enroute to Kaza in August 2019. Due to incessant rains we were held up at Tabo for three days as against the one day we had scheduled. But the owner Mr Rana was a very cooperative and warm person. The hotel was filled up with all the stranded people. but Mr Rana and his team ensured continuity in the services despite power cuts and a crowded environment. The food is very tasty,,,,services excellent...i recommend a must visit while at Tabo.........................",Saiabhishek,/Profile/Saiabhishek,,50
lahul_spiti,"The hotel is in a great location with good views of the mountains and right next to the Tabo monastery. The rooms are very basic, but are clean and have attached bathrooms with hot water. The restaurant served good food. Recommended for a short stay. ",taniarc21,/Profile/taniarc21,"Mumbai, India",40
lahul_spiti,"The hotel is nice, but the care for the guests here is non-existent.  location of the hotel is pretty good... but staff wasn't good at all ....... food was also average ... and prices was above the expectations... rooms are too small and shabby  Sadly it has got worse!! The service was atrocious and awfully deplorable !!!",windofhope,/Profile/windofhope,"Sikkim, India",30
lahul_spiti,"First hotel in the beginning of our lahaul and spiti trip.good location, just beside the tabo monastery which is a treasure trove in tabo.great hospitality by sunil. Room and bathroom were decent with both windows of room having good view.",Indranath Banerjee,/Profile/Indranath03,"Kolkata, India",40
lahul_spiti,"In the budget range ,this place is a very good place to stay in. We stayed for a night in Aug 2017 here @Rs 900 for 2 persons . Located next to the famous Tabo monastery . The food is good . Rooms are clean and nice ",Vipin Arora,/Profile/vipina776,"Lucknow, India",50
lahul_spiti,"Dekjt norphel. This is only place in spiti valley that I could find online to leave a review. This place was something more then we expected. The rooms were neat and basic, as any other rooms in spiti, but the food served at ther restaurant was good then what we expected. We had not had many options of food in spiti, but this place had variety in their menu, which has happiness for our hungry souls. This place is near to the monasteries, so that was a added benefit too.",Arshii A,/Profile/Arshii_anjum,"Bengaluru, India",40
lahul_spiti,"In spite of prior booking through out tour facilitator, we were denied room here and instead asked to stay at other facility (somewhere near the helipad). When we tried explaining the staff about our booking and displeasure, they got into argument and were pretty rude.  However, when we connected them to out tour facilitator over phone a room was instantly arranged. An example of deceitful staff at its best!!! The room wasn't all that impressive. They could have done a better job at keeping it orderly. The dinner is avoidable. Better options in neighborhood.  Please avoid this place if you planning overnight stay in Tabo.",DjangoIndiano,/Profile/DjangoIndiano,,10
lahul_spiti,We stayed here for one night. The view is mesmerizing. The host was helpful enough. He actually set up hookah and seating for us on the terrace. The rooms were good.  Warning: Do not take the ground floor room.,Abhishek Mukherjee,/Profile/bongmonktravels,"New Delhi, India",30
lahul_spiti,"One of the best things about this hotel is that it's a two minute walk to Taco Monastery. It's a pretty basic place, but the rooms are clean, the staff is reasonably helpful and friendly, the food is pretty good (one notable thing is that the restaurant has several Israeli dishes; there's probably a story behind that). It's not fancy, but Cabo's a small town far from any cities, so you shouldn't expect luxury.",John P,/Profile/Avidyadeva,"Canberra, Australia",40
lahul_spiti,"If you r traveling to Tabo keep one thing in mind that it is very small village located in corner of Himchal.The village is famous for it's monastery. The hotel is located 3 mins walking distance from Monastery.It provide very basic services like tasty food,hot water,cozy stay. Finding such a Hotel in the Tabo village is one kind of surprise. The owner Mr. Rana is very co operative and enthusiastic person.  Food: Hotel is having small kitchen with good dinning hall and one open air space. Mr. Rana personally looks after the kitchen and always try to provide best food. We had the the great coffee and had the great Chinese food.Taste was very good. Breakfast was also very good..  overall the BEST OPTION to stay in Tabo.",shaileshu10,/Profile/shaileshu10,"Dombivli, India",50
lahul_spiti,Gud rooms gud people n amazing food wud recommend every traveller to stay. Nearby is tabo monastery and there is no way that u won't love the place. Hospitality of the people there wud make ur trip even more memorable.,manik p,/Profile/931manikp,"Rampur, India",50
lahul_spiti,"The best thing about this place is that the Tabo Monastry is just a stone's throw away from here.  Apart from this, the food is decent and it's owner and staff are very friendly. As far as rooms are concerned, once you have reached this part of the world, I guess you have forgotten the word 'luxury' and 'comfort'. So, these are just the kind of ordinary rooms you get in these places. And rooms are all the same in Kaza, Tabo and nearby areas, so it doesn't really matters which hotel you check into. Keeping this in minds, Tiger's Den is good enough a place, close to the monastery with good staff to take care of you.",Rudra_Pan,/Profile/Rudra_Pan,"Mumbai, India",40
lahul_spiti,"If you are planning to stay in Tabo, you already are not a luxury oriented tourist but a accommodating  traveler.  But be prepared to really rough it out at Tiger Den, the room is very basic, hot water is erratic, the food service is very slow.  The staff tries to do their best but they maybe they are short staff to accomodate the sudden increase in the crowds in this sector  Location is great, close to the monastery  , if you get up early you can walk up for the chanting session at around 6 am. You can also take the small hike to the caves uphill. The view of Tabo from up there is great  Also the old monastery is one the best I have visited , the serene environment and the old paintings are breathtaking   If you are lucky enough to visit Tabo, please keep it litter free and",explorerspirit,/Profile/explorerspirit,"Mumbai, India",20
lahul_spiti,"Nicest hotel we stayed in the Himalayan mountains. Good view, good food, great hospitality from the manager. Meals never fail to surprise us and probably also the best food we had on the mountains. Basic amenities provided.",Raymond S,/Profile/Sgraymonds,Singapore,40
lahul_spiti,Horrible place. In spite of booking in advance we got such terrible rooms. We had booked 4 rooms and they gave us 2 rooms on the ground level and 2 rooms on 1st floor. The place was so dirty and the stench of the garbage and toilets made it difficult for us to even breathe and the owner of the place RANA was very rude and arrogant. My advice to fellow travellers please stay away from this place even if the location seems convenient.,farida k,/Profile/faridak571,"Pune, India",10
lahul_spiti,Location is the only usp of this hotel as it is just 100 meters away from the Old Monastery. Although there are several other homestays and guesthouses near the monastery but their access is through narrow lanes.   Rooms are too basic to be comfortable with smelly and apparently dirty linens.   Millennium guest house run by the monastery itself seems to be better option. ,ashishvetmed,/Profile/ashishvetmed,"Mathura, India",30
lahul_spiti,"The hotel is run by Vaneet Rana who is a disgrace to hotel industry & hoteliers in Spiti Valley. In spite of prior confirmation, payment & booking, when we reached the hotel the hotel owner rejected to accommodate us as he had accepted on the spot booking at a higher price than what we paid. Tabo is a kind of place which is quite remote & there are very less hotels there. The owner instead started suggesting us  other hotels where we can go & make the fresh booking. He didn't even refund our booking amount.  Try booking hotels such as Trojan, Hotel Siddharth & Dawachen Retreat etc. as this hotel can reject your confirmed booking anytime for their profits.  I am sure the two positve reviews are also fakely written by hotel staff itself.",mayur k,/Profile/386mayurk,"New Delhi, India",10
lahul_spiti,The rooms are spacious and all the amenities are there considering the remoteness of the place. The food is very good and they make excellent soups. Thukpa (Spiti version of Soup and noodles) is a must try. Stones throw from the ancient Tabo monastery. A good place to rest your weary self at the end of the long drive.,amitganpule,/Profile/amitganpule,Bilimora,40
lahul_spiti,"The hotel is in Tabo Village, which is in a bowl-shaped flat valley, and a stone's throw from the Tabo Chos-Khor Monastery. The rooms are spacious with basic amenities and clean and well-maintained. The manager and staff are very polite and considerate. Their hospitality was very warm and made our stay worthwhile. I can't thank them enough for their hearty welcome and care. The taste of the food was top-notch and while our stomachs were full we continued to eat out of greed. Also noteworthy of mention, is the dining area for its tasteful decor. It has floor seating with mattresses covered with colourful upholstery which brightens the room. The food and cutlery is laid/served on low tables enabling an ergonomic posture for eating.  I'd stay at this place when I am at Tabo next",vishaldutta,/Profile/vishaldutta,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
