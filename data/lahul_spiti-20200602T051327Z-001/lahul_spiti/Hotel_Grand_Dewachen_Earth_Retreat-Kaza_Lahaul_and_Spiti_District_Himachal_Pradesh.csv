lahul_spiti,"The Meaning of Dewachen:  Dewachen is a Buddhist term for “pure land, where body, speech and mind is one with the universe”.   Dewachen also means absolute wisdom of true happiness.   Location:  The hotel is located a few kilometers outside Kaza and on the outskirts of village Rangrik with large open vistas surrounding the hotel till one can reach the river Spiti.   As a result, views of mighty Himalayan snow peaks and beautiful blue sky is available from almost all rooms. At present there are 20 rooms on the ground and first level.   The property is being expanded on second level to create few suite rooms and other facilities.  The roof of the hotel is skylight roof which makes the entire property bright all through the day making it more pleasing and lively.

lahul_spiti,Kaza is a remote place and a small town with very less option for accommodation. The ones that are available are basic home stays with very little creature comforts. Grand Dewachen is rightfully the Kohinoor that stands out in otherwise inhospitable place especially if you want to unwind and relax after the treacherous driving and travelling. In Kaza accessibility to basic amenities is a luxury but this place provides all comforts that you could expect from resorts in any popular hill stations. The property stands out in a middle of nowwhere but with all comforts that we are used to from a modern hotel.  The rooms are spacious and the ones especially at the ground floor offers sofa cum beds where kids can be accomodated comfortably. The food is well prepared and the buffet had,SadakChaap,/Profile/SadakChaap,"New Delhi, India",50

lahul_spiti,"I have been on many road trips before but this time I was travelling with wife and kids. Usually I would stay with budget hotels/ home stays, but with family I needed something comfortable and luxurious. Dewachen was a breath of fresh air. Beautiful location, very scenic surroundings and great food. The hotels took great care of us. Mr. Rajinder Bodh, who is the owner ensured everything possible to give us that extra  comfort which kids loved after long driving hours. Highly recommended.",ashishtaneja,/Profile/ashishtaneja,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
