lahul_spiti,"The moment we enter,the artistic way of decoraties near the entrance attracts us.they had used all waste to give such an amused aesthetic appearance.like used bottles, tyres as seats... Rooms are done with mud ..With dry grass as ceiling..v.v.rustic feel as we enter..With super cozy beds&covers. But here the food is v.limited...And this is the only place in whole spitti valley i felt..No thought was given for food.they don't have any choice.and didn't even take effort to prepare.it is a disappointment.and breakfast they don't have anything..Apart from that when we asked for bread..They charged for 1 tbsp of butter for 40 rs..Which I found v.rediculous.and objected.we stayed in a room which has an attached washroom.But gyser didn't work! Only before bath i had realized.When i",Anita P,/Profile/anitap485,,30
lahul_spiti,"Pros:  Located on the main road in Tabo, Namsay guest house is a serene and decent place for a sleepover. Rooms are clean and well kept, staff is friendly & welcoming. They use the energies of nature very efficiently in maintaining the property and rent is also reasonable. P.S: Do not forget to have a look at the all bamboo ceiling, mesmerising.   Cons : Food could have been better. Only one room in the property has an attached washroom.",gaurav_humble,/Profile/gaurav_humble,"New Delhi, India",40
lahul_spiti,"This mud house homestay is present on road from Tabo to Dhankar.... It charged us 1000/~ for a room per night when we booked it on the spot in the evening.   It has just 5 rooms of varying sizes. As per the owner, just 1 room has an attached washroom. In the building housing the rooms, there is just 1 shared washroom to be used by guests of remaining 4 rooms. Our room was pretty spacious in comparison to other rooms. There is another washroom constructed near to the kitchen that is more spacious in comparison to the shared washroom. When we stayed, geyser of the shared washroom wasn't working and we had to resort to use the washroom next to the kitchen. The bed was cozy and comfortable. The room has more than 1 charging slot.

lahul_spiti,Namsay is an outstanding home stay with traditional houses which keeps you more warmer than regular concrete based hotels.   Place has amzing space with good grean and open area. Kitchen is small but well managed. Food was great.   Room stay just costed us Rs800/night for 2 PAX which was dirt cheap for the kind of property it is.   Namsay himself takes care of the traditional heritage property and makes you comfortable to the core.   Its a must stay place in tabo,Kuldeep Singh Y,/Profile/kuldeepsinghy2016,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",50
lahul_spiti,"Namsay Guesthouse is a beatutiful, spacious, clean and confortable place. The owner, Dr Surej is keen to pprotect  the house heritage. This is a real family running a real guesthouse situated on the road from Kaza. The food is great, the separate bathroom has all the mod cons and the whole atmosphere is cheerful and relaxed.

lahul_spiti,Excellent place to stay at Tabo. 5 minutes walk from the Tabo monastery. We visited at the end of August 2017. The rooms are typical Spitian mud rooms. 4 rooms in all. They also had a tent available if you want to stay there. The hosts are amazing with unparalleled hospitality. Food is amazing too. We had aloo jeera and roti for dinner. They also made us some maggi which we were carrying with us. All in all an amazing experience at Tabo with them.,Shruti M,/Profile/ShrutiM308,,50
lahul_spiti,This place is very easy to find on the main highway. Property is very spacious and well maintained. Traditional Hay and bamboo ceiling inside the rooms gave a perfect feel of spending a night in a remote village. Price wise this place is totally worth. Straight out of the window I could see a big Mountain and trillions of stars twinkling in the dark night. The best part of staying here was in the Early morning when we hiked to the spiti river flowing some 500 meters behind the property. The walk at the end is very steep so be careful and make sure your shoes having a good grip. ,Nikhil B,/Profile/476nikhilb,"Mumbai, India",50

lahul_spiti,"Dr. Suresh, an ayurvedic doctor by profession, runs and lives at the place with his brother's family. The accommodation is clean and adorned with the local art. It has both mud house and tented accommodation. The view from rooms is beautiful, the valley with some houses, apple orchards, farming, the serpentine Spiti River and the breathtaking view of the bare mountains. One can stay all day just gazing at the play of clouds. The accommodation is nearly the first one if you are approaching from Kaza. The homestay also provided homemade food on request and they offer local cuisine made by the family members, using local organically grown vegetables. The dining area is warm and cozy with low seating and tables in the local style and is worth the feel. There is one common toilet,",Jaya C,/Profile/JayaC151,,50
lahul_spiti,"Tabo, a quaint little town nestled in the heart of the Spiti Valley in Himachal Pradesh is a splendour in itself. We visited Tabo in June and were mesmerised by the beauty and stillness of the place. It is a perfect place for those looking to escape the hustle and bustle of the urban centres and are seeking to relax and rejuvenate.   The land harbouring the ancient Tabo monastery as well as the new one is a gem nestled in the heart of the Himalayas. At Tabo we stayed at Namsay Home stay which is truly a home away from home. The owner Dr. Suresh is one of the most hospitable and jolly persons I’ve ever come across. He seems to have a solution for all your needs!  We arrived at Tabo at around 4 in the evening and were greeted by the chirpy Dr. Suresh.  Our rooms were the authentic",Rachel A,/Profile/rachelarora,"New Delhi, India",40
lahul_spiti,"We have visited this place in Dec,2016.While leaving from kalpa we have contacted Dr. Suresh (Owner), He is an amazing person to talk with and his family (including two lil cats) did not let us feel they we are outta home. This is not a hotel, it's a b'ful home stay with almost everything we have in our homes. We enjoyed the stay as if we were the owner coz it was just us in spiti at that time.Food was good as it was homemade and best part was we all ate together. This place is near tabo monastery and owner's bhaiji works there so he took us to the monastery.Do visit THEY ARE AMAZING HOST lll",manishtonk1989,/Profile/manishtonk1989,"New Delhi, India",50
lahul_spiti,Namsay Homestay is one of the best stay option in Tabo. The traditional mud rooms with small doors and the traditional interior decoration is a special attraction. the spitian delicious but simple meal is something which reminds the taste of spiti valley. The owner Dr Suresh is very warm welcoming and highly knowledgeable person who guided us a lot about our tour plan in spiti valley.....i strongly recommend namsay homestay to all the new travellers. people can contact at 09418600825 or 09459965173 to book at the earliest coz i did not get these no at google ..so sharing the same......Namsay Homestay is really .....A Home away from Home.......,Vivek S,/Profile/viveks135,,50
lahul_spiti,"I stayed here in my 2016 Spiti ride when most things were closed. Their attraction was that their regular toilet was functional even as everything else required the use of a dry toilet.  The food was tasty and very well done, but again, simple dal chawal types stuff. The bathroom (shared) was very clean. I will definitely stay there again, and would recommend it to most folks, except those who want luxury.  This place is just after Tabo village, on the highway itself.",maddash-traveler,/Profile/maddash-traveler,India,50
lahul_spiti,"I stayed here for two nights. The host, Dr Suresh Chhering is an absolute delight. The homestay is built in traditional Spiti style. It's beautiful to look at and and comfortable inside. It's warm even without any heating due to it being built traditional style with packed mud. If you are looking for an authentic Spiti experience, this is the place to be.   The location is great, sort of central if you want to visit Kaza, Pin valley, Kibber or Dhankar. The price is very reasonable. The host, Dr Suresh Chhering will be able to direct you to places you would want to see.",anandmohan56,/Profile/anandmohan56,"Dharampur, India",50
lahul_spiti,"Close to midnight on a chilly dark night in November, 2015 after knocking the doors of each and every guest house and hotels in the town, we found Namsay Homestay. Closed for the season, it still welcomed and embraced us with its generous hands of hospitality. We were tired,cold and hungry after driving continuously from morning 6 AM. The outside temperature being -4 degrees and winds howling made things worse for us. Food was the only thing on our mind but who would cook us dinner at 11.45 PM? They did. The family of Dr. Suresh who manages the homestay cooked us steamy momos and omlettes with toasted bread. The next morning the whole family gathered around us during our breakfast feeding us with Parathas, Omlettes, toasted bread and potatoes and regaling us with local stories",Raman S,/Profile/0ramans,,50
lahul_spiti,"Namsay Homestay in Tabo is situated in a beautiful and peaceful location in Tabo. It is a traditional homestay with simple Indian, Chinese and Spitian meals. The culture of Spiti Valley is truly reflected here. It has all the amenities required for a comfortable stay. My husband and I stayed there in May 2016 during our trip to Spiti Valley. Dr. Suresh who manages the homestay is a very welcoming and knowledgeable person. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to everyone visiting Tabo.",Aditi K,/Profile/AditiK227,,50
