lahul_spiti,"We went to this hotel during the off season. We went without any booking and luckily they had rooms. There was a power cut there but they had a generator running. The staff were ultra helpful and went out of their way to help us - lending us their phone when we were struggling for network on ours, making us packed food at 5am in the morning.  On top of that the views from this hotel were simply breathtaking. The best holiday activity I can think of is to drink tea at the terrace of this hotel and watch the sun come bathe the Himalayas with its golden light! Also the house dog is a very nice companion who seemed to love my boots!",AVHimalayan,/Profile/AVHimalayan,"Bengaluru, India",50
lahul_spiti,"We stayed at this beautiful property for 2 nights, at the end of October. From outside it looked like a typical local cute Tibetian style home. We had booked 2 rooms and we stayed at the first floor, facing front side. The rooms were large and cozy with beautiful decor. At Kaza none of us had mobile network. And this hotel had free wifi which had a very good range, though not very fast, but it was good to have that much needed connectivity at this remote part of India. The geyser perfectly worked fine and the room was comfortable, when the minimum temperature at night was -15C. We loved the food of the hotel. We even asked for some extra gravy and chicken in our one plate order, which they happily served. Last day we had to start very early morning. They were happy to serve us",riadas,/Profile/riadas,"Pune, India",50
lahul_spiti,"Have been visiting this hotel for many years obviously because of their service and good rooms. My stays here have always been very good. The hotel offers rooms with old world charm as well as newly constructed rooms in their other block. Rooms are big, clean and cozy with good double beds and warm blankets. Water problems did crop up this year and food quality also seems to have suffered a bit but hopefully it shall spring back to how it was earlier.",sheetal b,/Profile/Vagabonde2016,"Mumbai, India",50
lahul_spiti,"The rooms brought back childhood memories of the army accommodation, with their furniture and furnishing. It has an underlying theme of the British colonial d√©cor which added to the old-school charm. Wall-to-wall carpet, bright rugs, and wooden furniture lent an earthy and warm ambience to the room. Everything was clean, well-maintained, and pristine. The view of the mountains from the window was the icing on the cake. The manager and staff of the hotel were very kind and helpful with their sincere courtesy and hospitality. It made our stay memorable and they deserve all the credit for it. The food was full of flavour and taste that turned us into gluttons.  I know where I will stay on my next visit to Kaza. And so do some of my friends and acquaintances.",vishaldutta,/Profile/vishaldutta,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
lahul_spiti,"I stayed in Khangsar 6 weeks ago (August 2015) during my drive from the southern most tip of India to the northen most road-end. I was in Kaza for 3 days and it was a great experience staying at Khangsar. The hotel is right on the main road towards the end of Kaza town if you are coming from the Keylong side. It is situated just 200 meters from the only Petrol/Diesel station in the valley. The nearest other fuel station is 300 Kms either way. The reason I am mentioning this is that the hotel is located in an ideal location  if you are self driving or biking. As the pump often runs dry of fuel, it is nice to be near the pump to know when the supply arrives.  But the real reason I loved this hotel was very personal and prompt service. Kaza is a remote town and electric supply is",Dinesh_Mannan,/Profile/Dinesh_Mannan,"Gurgaon, Haryana, India",50
lahul_spiti,"I stayed in Khangsar hotel last week. The hotel seems old from outside, but inside the rooms and bathrooms are kept really well. So, do not judge the hotel from outside. There are 2 wings in the hotel. The front wing is costlier than the back wing. The rooms in the front wing are larger and with TV. But I personally preferred the rooms in the back wing- which are only ""slightly"" smaller, don't have TV, but great views of the mountains from one's window and balcony. The sit out balcony in the back wing is common between 5 rooms, but its very specious and lets you have your own privacy.   Please do keep in mind that Kaza is a very remote place, therefore electricity is patchy. I do not blame the hotel at all for this. In fact, they are quite prompt in putting on the generator in",Richa G,/Profile/Richa_Gupta83,"Pune, Maharashtra, India",50
lahul_spiti,"After reaching Kaza from Langza- Hikkim trek, we checked into the hotel Khangsar. Khangsar is a good hotel adjacent to the main road when you just enter the Kaza. They have big and comfortable rooms at reasonable prices, running hot water in bathrooms, full power back up and WiFi which is very rare luxury in the Spiti valley. After spending time in Langza-Hikkim- Komic, I was feeling altitude sickness and stomach upset so I requested hotel if they can prepare light khichdi for me and they happily prepared two times. Hotel owner Chotu bhai is a very nice and helpful person and hotel staff is good.",101Miles,/Profile/101Miles,,40
lahul_spiti,"Good, spacious, newly built rooms. This place is good for people coming in groups. Food is good. The hotel is on the main road near the lone petrol pump in Kaza and has a lot of parking space. Good stay option for people looking for a under 1000 accomodation.",xplrtrvl,/Profile/xplrtrvl,"Meerut, India",40
lahul_spiti,"Hotel is right on the road and have enough parking space,staff is helpful but the rooms that were allocated to us  were new and looked not neat from outside however they were good from inside. the bathroom was big enough but the taps were not working properly,and one needs to walk to the reception to avail the facilities. the food is good and one can chat for hours and enjoy with beer.",Nitin B,/Profile/nitinbourai,noida,30
lahul_spiti,"No electricity all through out our stay here. The generator set was out of order all the time. Warm water was serve form out. Towels, blankets and bed sheets were not clean and stunk. Tea was served cold. Would not want to visit again.",Prajakti,/Profile/Prajakti,"Mumbai, India",20
lahul_spiti,"This is a decent hotel , reasonably prices and made better by excellent , helpful and smiling staff. The rooms are average size and reasonably neat. when we went there was no running water but the staff diligently helped without flinching on multiple requests.  would have to mention the food offered by the hotel as easily the best i had in Kaza by a long shot.",sbadhn,/Profile/sbadhn,"Singapore, Singapore",40
lahul_spiti,"Khangsar Hotel was a nice traditional Hotel in Kaza, the main town in the Spiti Valley. The Hotel is currently run by a very friendly family of grandfather, father and son. And supported by a very efficient and friendly staff.  Kaza in the month of April is still very cold and extreme, but the staff made it comfortable by looking after our every needs. The owner Mr Palden is a very freindly and honest person who took us around the Spiti Valley to various beautiful villages and monasteries.  The rooms are large and well furnished, and there is fantastic view from the windows  A must stay in a one of the most beautiful but extreme places in the world.",Amritendu r,/Profile/royamrit,"Kolkata, India",50

lahul_spiti,"We went to Kaza without booking hotels during august.We found that most of the guest houses were full and finally found out about Khangsar from Spiti Adventures office.This hotel is at the start of the city and next to a Monestry and a kilometre distance from main Bus stand.They charged a decent amount of Rs.500 per day as we were staying for 2 days.A very good place to stay,neat,clean and hygienic.Food was very delicious and decently priced. You can see beautiful sunrise from the hotel itself if you head out on terrace and it is just a bliss to see the different shades of mountains surrounding the valley. Overall very good experience.",Varsha P,/Profile/124varshap,"Bengaluru, India",40
