lahul_spiti,We have booked this place for a night in Tabo while going towards Kaza. But due to some other guests we were shifted to a nearby homestay Sonam Homestay. The rooms are quite good and also the staffs are very helpful. The dinner was delicious and a wonderful place to stay and enjoy.,Amrita2983,/Profile/Amrita2983,"Kolkata, India",50
lahul_spiti,"I loved that place, specially the owner, Shanteen... She was lovely and kind... When I left I remember I had to give her a hug because her energy was so powerful... She treated us super good and the guest house was perfect and clean, very comfy üòä I'll go back one day!!!! ",Yolanda,/Profile/Yolanda_dpm,"Madrid, Spain",50
lahul_spiti,"Nestled in middle of Himalayas, right outside the Tabo Monastry, managed by enterprising and active lady. Infrastructure is good, clean bathrooms, morning tea is available on demand, feels like being at home, Tabo is a beautiful little village on way to Kaza, must visit must stay place..",Ravdeep,/Profile/Ravdeep,New Delhi,50
lahul_spiti,"This place is an absolute gem in tiny Tabo. We stayed here for 2 nights. The room was spacious, comfortable and clean. The super friendly owner and his wife were excellent hosts offering Chai on arrival and plenty of local knowledge too!   It's well located at the start of the village and easy to find. We only had breakfast on the last day here but it was fantastic!   With such a friendly and warm feel this place is a great option for a stay in Tabo ",Ollie L,/Profile/743olliel,"Yangon (Rangoon), Myanmar",50

lahul_spiti,"Our room was simple but spotlessly clean. Good attached bathroom, very good shower, hot water heated by solar energy (suprisingly efficient, almost scalding). Laundry on request. Excellent quality for the price. Run by a very friendly, open-hearted family. Seating area at front of the guesthouse was a nice place to have a tea and chat to the owners and fellow travellers. Located at the main street, between the bus stand and the monastery, short walking distance to both.",Jozin,/Profile/Jozin,Poland,50
lahul_spiti,"I stayed at Kesang Homestay with my friends for two nights in 2016. The rooms were neat and clean with hot water geyser. There were no TVs in the room, but who needs TV when you're in Spiti. Aunty was very friendly and since it was our first time in Spiti, she helped us plan our next couple of days as well. Recommended to backpackers, and travellers on budget trip who aren't looking for anything fancy, but a neat and clean room with all basic facilities and warm hospitality.",d1neshv,/Profile/d1neshv,"Narkanda, India",50
lahul_spiti,"Kesang Homestay shall remain the most memorable stay of my 9 days of Spiti trip with friends during June 2017. The Kesang family runs this homestay, the rooms are spacious and extremely clean, but the home cooked food by Aunty was the best part of our stay. The food is served at their own dining area and its delicious. The family is extremely warm and I have never experienced such good hospitality before. Do not think twice before booking this place if you are planning to stay in Tabo.",Sanmitra M,/Profile/sanmitram,,50
lahul_spiti,"So, due to wanderlust I went back to Spiti and stayed at Kesang home stay again. This time also my stay was absolutely fantastic. The rooms and linen are clean and odorless.  The icing on the cake was the dinner cooked by the lady of the house. We had Rajma (Red Beans) and Aloo Tamatar (Potatoes in a tomato gravy) and this was the best meal in the entire two week Kinnaur and Spiti trip (Confirmed by my 10 year son as well).  The honesty and humility of the family is amazing, Mrs. Bodh did not charge us for the food despite me begging them too (they had similarly not charged me last year for tea and butter toasts) and the amount of hard work that they do is a humbling experience.  If in Tabo please stay elsewhere only if Kesang home stay does not have rooms.",Taurus1973,/Profile/Taurus1973,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",50
lahul_spiti,"we landed at this place by chance. While on our way to Kaza from Nako we ended up getting stuck before Sumdo due to falling rocks for almost 7 hours forcing us to stop at Tabo to avoid a night drive to Kaza.  And thank God for this stop in Tabo. This was the first place we saw as soon as we entered the small village of Tabo. We were greeted by Mrs Samten Dolma, wife of Mr. Sherab Kersang, the owner. From the word go, this place was a Godsend. Super clean, large rooms with very clean bathrooms, hot water with electricity backup and satellite TV. All this for a price which is unbelievably low. And their attitude and approach is still true to the mountain and Buddhist culture. They are not here to rip travellers off (unlike the guys a Moonlake - Nako). They run the guest house as",Wanderingsoul31,/Profile/Wanderingsoul31,"Mumbai, India",50
lahul_spiti,"Home Stay un peu excentrer, proche du bus-stand d'un c√¥t√© et du centre de Tabo de l'autre. Cyber caf√© au rez (si internet il y a), lits bien douillets et une des meilleures douche de mon voyage (de 3mois) !!! Une famille aimable et naturellement serviable, ambiance tr√®s authentique, excellant Cha√Ø et tr√®s bonne cuisine.",Guillaumesarace,/Profile/Guillaumesarace,"Lausanne, Switzerland",50
lahul_spiti,"Bien situ√©, proche de l‚Äôarr√™t de bus. Les chambres sont spacieuses, claires, pratiques. Plusieurs ont les sanitaires individuels, un luxe dans un endroit aussi retir√©. Sherap et Samten font tout pour rendre le s√©jour agr√©able. Au rez de chauss√©e bient√¥t peut √™tre quand internet reviendra........ le cybercaf√© rouvrira ses portes!",Agnes C,/Profile/AgnesC179,"Nice, France",40
lahul_spiti,"We stayed in Kesang Home Stay, owned by the warm and kind Sherab Bodh and his wife. The rooms are basic, but clean and well maintained. Kesang is located on the main entry road, though the village gate, about 200m from the main road. That makes it better than most of the other stay options in Tabo, which are on the narrow road to Kaza. You will certainly enjoy Sherab's hospitality, including the home-meals cooked by his wife. The front courtyard, with a white umbrella awning is the place to sit around, chat and sip tea. And yes, the health centre is located right opposite, so in case you need assistance--it's right there. Highly recommended.",Arindam_traveller,/Profile/Arindam_traveller,"Mumbai, India",40
lahul_spiti,"We reached tabo after long 10 hrs journey from sangla and after inquiring  at nearby hotel(which was luckily packed!!) bang on this homestay!!and what a great luck we had!!Mr Tsering greet us warm welcome and we ,3 families, immediately decided to stay there!! Rooms were cozy with good,basic wooden furniture. Bathrooms were equipped with geysers as well as solar. We had morning tea with them,no food. Mr tsering was very resourceful and helpful. He inquired for road conditions at pin valley at early morning for us as news came the previous day that land slide had blocked the roads there. Very economical Will highly recommend it!!",drtejaschauhan,/Profile/drtejaschauhan,"Rajkot, India",50
lahul_spiti,"Sarabh Bhaiya and Aunty- Thanks for your kindness.  I reached Tabo on 11th may, 2016 and checked in Kesang Homestay for 1 night. The views from the roof, humble nature of owners, food and of course the price- everything was perfect.  Also, Please ask Aunty for Tea :)",amaanmohammad,/Profile/amaanmohammad,"Kanpur, India",50
lahul_spiti,"The Kesang home stay is right at the entry of Tabo, which in itself occupies a smaller area than any major mall in Delhi. The family of Mr. Bodh lives on the ground floor while the top floor has rooms that they give out on rent. Mrs. Bodh is a very warm and helpful lady, didn't meet Mr. Bodh as he was out of station. The rooms are airy, clean, with nice bathrooms and hot showers (Solar water heater). Had food elsewhere so can't comment on that, the masala tea prepared by Mrs. Bodh was excellent though.",Taurus1973,/Profile/Taurus1973,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",50
lahul_spiti,"Tabo is famed for its monastery - established in 996 AD. Most people who come to this part of India, Spiti valley do so in a car (or 4WD) - I chose to do this by bus, like a local. I wasnt disappointed. People were very friendly, more on that in other reviews. I arrived at Tabo after a 10 hour ordinary bus journey from Recong Peo and was very tired. Kesang home stay is walking distance from the bus stand. Mr Tserap Bodh (proprietor) is resourceful, energetic and helpful with stay, transport and communication facilities. Mrs Bodh is an excellent cook who‚Äôd make some lovely home cooked stuff for you. Their young nephew sonam runs errands. Rooms were the cleanest I had stayed in on a two week trip and very inexpensive even by Indian standards ! They have a working internet center",Quest39570294506,/Profile/Quest39570294506,"New Delhi, India",50
