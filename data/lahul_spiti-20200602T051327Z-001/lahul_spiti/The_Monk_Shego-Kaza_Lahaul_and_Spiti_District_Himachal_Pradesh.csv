lahul_spiti,I reached Shego and planned to stay here for 2 days instead i ended up staying here for 6 days. The tents are quite affordable and also ooze of luxury. They also offer cottages for those who cant bear the cold. The camp site is a vast grassland nestled in a valley surrounded by snow clad mountains and Spiti river flowing 70-80 meters from the camp site. Also there is a stream flowing behind the campsite. The owner Mr. Sushil Negi and Mr. Mukesh are very cooperative & Kind. Also the staff are polite and make u feel at home. I highly recommend a stay at  The Monk if u visit Kaza. They also have a hotel and a camp in Kalpa as well.    ,Aakash D,/Profile/aakashd441,,50
