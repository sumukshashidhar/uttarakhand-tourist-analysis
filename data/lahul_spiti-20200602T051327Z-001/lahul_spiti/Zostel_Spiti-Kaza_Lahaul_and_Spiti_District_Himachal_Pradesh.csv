lahul_spiti,"An amazing place in the midst in the mesmerizing Spiti Valley. Zostel has one thing which any other place lacks - a beautiful volleyball court. Everyone gathers in the court in evening for a game or 6!. I must say this was the highlight of the trip to play at 12,000ft. Zostel provides you with an amazing stay which uplifts your entire travel experience. Everyone must stay in Zostel and interact with all the awesome people who manage that place and, if you are not running short of oxygen, then share a beedi with them.

lahul_spiti,"Really loved the place. Super cool staff and the best service. Ambiance is great, comfortable and clean rooms. Zostel will make your trip memorable. Staying in Tents outside is worth experiencing. If you are planning to explore Kaza and Spiti, zostel is the best place to stay.",Anupama T,/Profile/AnupamaT38,,50
lahul_spiti,"Hostel spiti is a lovely property right at the end of kaza ( if coming from Losar). This means that it overlooks fields and hills and you don't feel like you are in the chaotic and busy lanes of kaza. It is a warm, vibrant and fun place to spend your time in the town. The rooms, including the dorms are clean and comfortable, and food is hygienic and homely. It is usually full of backpackers, trekkers and cyclists from around the world and i spent some very enjoyable evenings chatting with other guests at zostel. Thanks to its large and inviting front lawn and dorms, zostel  fosters interactions and conversations with other travellers, which is wonderful.   Sheetal and Vishal are doing a splendid job in running the property. We really enjoyed their company hospitality friendship",Gaurav G,/Profile/gauravg67,,50

lahul_spiti,"Perfectly located, nice and comfortable rooms, great ambiance and over that awesome food, Zostel spiti has everything that a traveler can ask for. This was our first stay in a Zostel and we totally loved it. Apart from the dorms you can also choose to stay in the tents situated outside and on the rooftop. Nightsky view is mesmerinsing from the rooftop tents. Also the staff is very warm and welcoming.",kamal kishor s,/Profile/kamalkishors4,,50
lahul_spiti,"Had visited this place in July 2016. Its a great place to be there.Great Location. Although reaching there is a little difficult but once you reach it has lot to offer you. If you are a backpacker zostel is the right place. They offer common rooms as well as one private room. Vishal & Aashu, who are currently managing Zostel are great guys. U need anything just ask them. Even if they don't have that they will ARRANGE. The other staff is great too. very helpful.",Bhawna24,/Profile/Bhawna24,"New Delhi, India",50
lahul_spiti,"If you are a solo traveller, Zostel Spiti is the right place to find some good company. The rooms are good, the place is close to the ""market,"" the bus stand is near by, the service is excellent. They have a washing machine for you dirty clothes, a phone for your talks, and a very warm common room for some light entertainment. But the best thing about this place are the people that runs it. A big shout out to Sheetal and Ashu, they are the host, and trust me, they are the best you will ever find; very kind, friendly and not to forget, funny. The supporting staff is great. From Devi who serves you food to the Chef ""Panditji"" everybody is great. If you have been to Kaza and you haven't stayed in Zostel then I suggest you go back! Oh, and don't forget to stargaze  at night! Cheers!",atiqur r,/Profile/atiqur_aren,"New Delhi, India",50
lahul_spiti,"If you are a backpacker and love to interact with other travelers, Zostel is the place for you. The common room in Zostel will always bring someone in common with whom you can plan your travel, be it for trekking, sharing taxi or to get a lift if you are a solo traveler. The only thing is you need to communicate. Not only that, people who are managing there has a great hospitality, specially Vishal (he is managing Zostel, Spiti). Ask him anything or about any information for you travel, he will do his best to gather all possible information for you. He is very kind and helpful!!

The view from the rooms and the dorms is amazing...they also provide  v comfortable tents. Wifi works v well.. The food and the other facilities provided were v good. They also had the courtesy to send back the forgotten jacket all the way to mumbai. A must visit..10/10",bhaveshdoshi85,/Profile/bhaveshdoshi85,"Mumbai, India",40
lahul_spiti,"The amenities and not the best, but that is not why you go to Spiti. Zostel is close to the bus stand and easily accessible. I stayed at the dormitory for a day and slept in the common room for the next, meeting a lot of amazing fellow travelers, cracking jokes, sharing food, listening to great music, watching someone get inked and most importantly making new friends.  The WIFI will help because most of the mobile phones wont work in this region. The washing machine can be quite useful as well :)  Most importantly, the hosts were the best. Sheetal, Anshu and Devi really did try to keep us all happy and comfortable and will do the same for you as well.",Jaseem A,/Profile/332jaseema,,50
lahul_spiti,"Service :  Zostel Spiti team extremely friendly and very welcoming on arrival. In my experience, it's unusual to get such helpful service from a hostel at this price and it made all the difference. The reception is open 24 hours a day and the staff are more than happy to share their Spiti Valley knowledge.  Room & Tents :  Bedrooms are a good size and offer sufficient room for personal space, thereby softening the blow of staying in a dorm. Dorms are minimally furnished - almost to the point of being bare. Each guest is assigned their own locker. Plug sockets & lamp by each bed.  Value For Money :  Excellent, considering the facilities, friendly service and central location.  Free Wi-Fi is also included in the price. Towels can be rented.

This was to our surprise and enlightening that we were one the very first guests there and we could't thank more that the place was Amazzzziiiiing!!! The place is so refreshing in terms of the atmosphere, the area where it is build - absolute picturesque, the brother or should call them owners (Vishal & Aashish) are so welcoming and even the rest of the staff.  A small place, great to hangout and when it comes to food, the cook (Pandit ji) does and extraordinary job.  The Painitings add so much to the place that it will make you stay more.

lahul_spiti,"Spiti tour was going great and became excellent the moment I reached Zostel Kaza. Have been a fan of Zostel since its initiation and when heard about them opening at Kaza it became an instant addition to the list as a place I must stay, on a tour which otherwise was based on just crash in anywhere for the night.   The basics were set perfect as expected... A clean Dorm, Hot Water, Free Wi-Fi and Bunch of fellow like minded travellers from different walks of life and from different parts of the globe. But this one was meant to be special. The Negi Brothers are like the 3 musketeers who take care of this backpackers base, ensured 100% commitment to deliver a stay where nobody feels like stranger.

lahul_spiti,"Zostel is a very budget friendly accommodation in Kaza..Its run by youngsters who are quick to service any requests and treat every one professionally.  You'l find a lot of nationalities staying here, and it makes for a great place for sharing your itineraries/stories and getting relevant information.. Its one of the first few properties when you enter from the Shimla side.   We booked the private room at Zostel at had no issues whatsoever..there is an option of Luxury tents,regular tents and dorms as well. A common dining/resting room and some bathrooms make it easier for people to come here for a pit-stop and then move on.
