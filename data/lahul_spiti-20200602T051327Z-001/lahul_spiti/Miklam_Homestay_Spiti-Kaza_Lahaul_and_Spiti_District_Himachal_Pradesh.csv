lahul_spiti,"The Miklam is like home away from home and better than most 4/5 star properties in terms of coziness. The host Mr. Karma left no stone unturned to ensure that we were comfortable. His insight into the local culture and beliefs helped us in understanding the place and it's people. The facilities in the spacious property were par excellence. The flooring is wooden panelled and each room has an operational fireplace. The food served is excellent. The personal touch accorded by Mr. Karma, his wife and the caretaker is much appreciated. The location is exotic and is away from the hustle bustle of Kaza and is on the highway to Manali. This is the best place to stay during trip to Kaza. ",sweetu t,/Profile/sweetut,,50
