lahul_spiti,"Like all moustache hostels you know what you get and it's good - a decent bed, nice soft thick blanket, reading light, curtain for privacy plus plenty of storage for bags.  Moustache Pushkar has a beautiful roof terrace and central garden area with some awesome artwork on show. Staff also really friendly and professional. Coffee was very good and so was there vege burgers.  Would stay again for sure.",Peter,/Profile/Petem4d,,50

lahul_spiti,"This hostel seems a favorite for tourists. There are many many rooms, nice courtyard and rooftop hang out spaces, comfortable, clean blankets and beds, daily activities, great staff and a nice environment. The price point is very good as well.  But because it is such a happening hostel, people stay up late. There was loud talking and noise until about midnight which could be heard from the rooms. I did come during an Indian vacation time, so that may have contributed, but there didn't seem to be quiet hours. If you don't mind potential noise during the night and morning, or like to stay up late, this hostel is a great choice",Braden,/Profile/SirMeow,,50
lahul_spiti,A wonderful and cozy place on an accessible distance from all the monuments and amenities. Helpful staffs with local knowledge guiding travelers about the place are just amazing.

lahul_spiti,I enjoyed staying in Moustache KHAJURAHO the staff is very helpful and nice. I felt comfortable and safe just like. If you are visiting Khajuraho and have low budget must stay in this Hostel.  Had a wonderful experience...,Aby,/Profile/Aby744,,50
lahul_spiti,"The people working in this hostel were very friendly and accommodating. Our room was clean and provided with a towel each. Sadly the shower was only warm for about 30 seconds and then went stone cold. There was also no electricity at all the next day so we could not do much. The food and chai tea on the rooftop was of a poor quality also. If you want a cheap, clean and safe place to sleep, Moustache is the place for you! ",Sarah,/Profile/sarah_lynam,Ireland,30

Highly recommended.",Saurav Kumar,/Profile/thesauravkumar,"Varanasi, India",50
