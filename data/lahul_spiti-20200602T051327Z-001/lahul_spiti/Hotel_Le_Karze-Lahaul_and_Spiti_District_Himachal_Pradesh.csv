lahul_spiti,"The property is located in the market and is very big property considered the small town Kaza is. Facilities could have been much better in terms of infrastructure.... hot water is a problem, electricity is a problem, food options is a constraint. The quality of food is average as well. Having said this the staff is courteous and tried to do their best given whatever they could.   Having reached Kaza through much smaller towns and rustic destinations, I have experienced better facilities on the way. So in a place like Kaza one would expect a better infra.  There are far better places to stay and experience Kaza, that would be my one line summation.",743naveenr,/Profile/743naveenr,"Bengaluru, India",30

lahul_spiti,"The one I stayed in Le Karze had two rooms, a neat wash room, one sit out and an open balcony. It was the best room in the hotel I guess. The windows opened into the surrounding street with the spectacular view of snow cladded mountains. I literally used to sleep everyday with my windows open so that I can hear the flow of the stream. They got a beautiful terrace from where you can do star gazing at night, count your shooting stars and witness the royal milkyway. They offer good food and generous service.",zanypts,/Profile/zanypts,"Nedumbassery, India",50
lahul_spiti,Situated right almost at the end of the Kaza market with views overlooking the Rocky mountains with good quality food and bar facility. The rooms are big and clean. A little expensive in comparison to other hotels in Kaza but the stay will be good. Awesome panoramic view from the terrace of the hotel. Recommend to stay at this place if heading to Kaza.,Tushar T,/Profile/TusharT158,,40
