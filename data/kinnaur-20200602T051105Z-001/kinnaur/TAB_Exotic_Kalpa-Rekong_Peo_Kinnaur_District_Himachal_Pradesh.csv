kinnaur,"On 11-12 sep i have visited Kalpa and stay in this hotel. Location of the place is so good that you cal feel the hill Kailas-Kinnar from your room from the first floor. The hotel is attached with apple orchard. As this is the apple season in kalpa, the trees are full with apple. We have enjoyed very much there.",VetManas,/Profile/VetManas,"Kolkata, India",40

kinnaur,"We stayed for a night and it was an absolute delight. Mr Sanjay Thakur is a fabulous host  and a very good conversationalist. TAB means Thankur and Brothers. We had booked 3 rooms in the first floor, rooms were big, very clean and comfortable. Bathroom was big, sparkling clean and with running hot water. Food was excellent, service was splendid. We really wanted to extend our stay here, but due to tight schedule we couldn't. We are definitely going back there to spend more time.   The property is facing the famous Kinnaur Kailash, and view is just spectacular.  Apple orchards around the hotel was beautiful.    I would definitely recommend Tab Exotic. :)",Jajaborsuwali,/Profile/rashmi6430,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",50
kinnaur,"stayed for a night. First floor is a new construction. Big, airy rooms with wonderful view of kinner kailash and apple orchards. Helpful and smiling staff. Owner has good knowledge of the area and better to consult him before making your sightseeing programme. The ground floor rooms although cheaper, but wont recommend them. Food provided is basic but freshly prepared and reasonably tasty. May be only improvements required are a proper dining hall and better upkeep of front lawn.",khadds,/Profile/khadds,"Bengaluru, India",50
