kinnaur,The view out of the window is breathtaking. The rooms are cozy and the hosts are warm. Nice place to stay if you are visiting chitkul. The food is not very great. There are better places with better concepts like zostel to explore.,GrandTour829444,/Profile/GrandTour829444,"Mohali, India",30

kinnaur,"As part of our trip to Kinnaur region from 21.05 to 30.05, we visited Narkanda - Sangla - Chitkul - Sarhan - Fagu. We were at Chhitkul from 25.05 to 28.05. We booked the hotel well in advance and paid full amount except advance for one room. We reached at Wanderer's nest in the late afternoon. We booked in all 4 premium rooms and were allotted Room No. 301 to 303 and 201. The Hotel is scenically located in the little uphill. We have to walk for 10 minutes by the pathway so as to reach the Hotel. Being at 11350 ft above sea level it is very hectic experience to walk upto the hotel.  So everybody must make up their mind that the hotel is not easily approachable by vehicle but one has to walk uphill to reach the Hotel. The mobile phones  are not operating  beyond Rachchaam.

kinnaur,"Chitkul is such a charming tiny little village, literally at the very end of India on Tibetan border. Words cannot describe its charm. And wanderers nest is perfectly named, that is what it is. It is surrounded by beautiful snow clad mountains on all sides. You will have to walk about 150m uphill from parking place. If there is luggage, staff will help you to carry. All the rooms offer view of mountains, premium ones from 2 windows, otherwise there is not much difference. Facilities wise, please note that you are in one of the most remote parts of India and do not expect luxuries. In fact at the time we went (mid April) temperatures were still going to freezing in night times which meant no running water in bathrooms. The staff would bring in buckets of water(freezing) on",vijay232,/Profile/vijay232,"Hyderabad, India",50

kinnaur,"Good clean rooms, very polite and helpful staff, good food at service. Chitkul itself does wonders as a location, so view from common balcony/corridor is great. One suggestion - should have room heaters in each room - rod heaters would be good enough.  Things to note: Top floor rooms may have water leakage from the roof while raining. There was one in my room and one in the bathroom. Staff was immediately ready to change my room. One may not find all items on the menu due to accessibility issues of Chitkul. Common area outside the rooms should be better maintained and cleaned up especially for a 2K tariff.  Room Tip: Three rooms on each floor - The room away from the stairs would have the best view - windows on two sides. Other two rooms have good views too but the end one is",DarkLindt,/Profile/DarkLindt,Mumbai,40

""Boards"" will guide you to the most amazing stay at Chitkul. I reached there by 3pm and took a dorm room. It's cute. Has bunk beds and well cleaned rooms and bathroom. The hotel is at a hill top above the village so you get an amazing view of the village in the evening. It turned out to be even better for me because I discovered that my birthday twin, an actress of Bareilly ki barfi and fanney khan fame, has also put up at the same place with her friends.

kinnaur,"This newly opened hotel undoubtedly gives you the best view of the village and the surrounding mountains.  But things to keep in mind: A. The food is not good, very expensive (even in Chitkul standard), and served in small quantities. Since this hotel is on the other side of the village with no other hotels/ restaurants nearby, you have no other option. B. It involves a full 10 minutes climb from the road.  C. The bathroom is a joke. There is a super tiny sink just underneath a shelf, so you have to uncomfortably stoop down to even wash your face. They tried to be ""modern"" but failed miserably. I would have preferred them not to try. D. We booked a room for three, but the extra bed that they were planning to provide was basically a single mattress.  E.

kinnaur,"The wanderer's nest : We stayed in 1st week of June 2018. The place is good 10 minutes of climbing stairs from parking place. May not be suitable for elderly people. Just park your car and climb without luggage. They will send someone to bring your luggage from car. Wanderer's nest provides probably the best view of Chitkul Village and mountains in the background. The owner is cooperative. The bathroom was very small with drainage problems. Also there was no ventilation. There was a window but we could not open it because of flies and mosquitos. As the hotel is newly opened, there were minor problems, but you tell them and they will try their best to rectify them. Overall a comfortable stay.

kinnaur,"Before you know of the Hotel, do remember the village it is located in is very remote. the village is at an altitude of 3450 mts. Since it is hilly terrain, the car is parked on the road and the hotel is a 2-3 minute climb up on the hill. Even fit people might find it tough, given the rarified oxygen levels there. Try to avoid taking small children and elderly people there as they may find difficulty breathing there. Also only BSNL works there. Having said that, the place, Wanderer's Nest is fantastic. Manoj the man behind Wanderer's Nest has made it extremely well. It is located at the beginning of the village and is a 2-3 minute climb up and hence it has a commanding view of the Chitkul and Baspa Valleys. The place is clean, comfy, cosy and the staff are extra nice. The Chef",Anshumaan S,/Profile/430anshumaans,,50
kinnaur,"We stayed here one night in June 2018. We booked two rooms and got one on the third floor and one on the first floor. Both rooms were great with wonderful views of the snowy peaks that frame Chitkul. To reach the hotel you have to climb up a rough path so it may not be suitable for older guests. The hotel staff were very helpful and assisted my mother. The third floor room was very well appointed, with a lovely garden scene painted on the walls. The owner Manoj was very welcoming and we had a lovely chat. The food is great as well. This hotel is on the opposite site of the village where most of the other hotels are. So you'll have a lovely peaceful stay away from the day trippers. Highly recommended!",Saheli S,/Profile/SaheliS28,,50

On researching for homestays in the region, we came across The Wanderer's Nest, which had recently been launched. The view is absolutely mind-blowing as the hotel is located in a valley surrounded by snow-capped mountains on all four sides. There arent a lot of good stay options available here and The Wanderer's Nest is the best in terms of location and food.  The food at The Wanderer‚Äôs Nest is the highlight and we were very happy with the Nepali cook they have employed.

Since we wandered to this place without any plans, the first sign board of the hotel we saw was - ""Wanderer's Nest"", located on the ridge right before the village entry. And going with name and it's location seen at distance - we decided to stay here. And I must say it was the BEST decision to do so.
