kinnaur,"We traveled to Kalpa after 4 days in Taj Theog, Simla, and since this is a tiny village we hadn't expected much, but oh we were in for such a surprise! The views of Jorkanden and Ralden from each room are to die for, and you can even spot the Kinnaur Kailash trident using the binoculars present in the upper deck/ library in the hotel. The sit-out here on the library deck was perfect for watching the sun rise (I even shot a time-lapse video).   The hotel is owned by Mr Prithviraj Negi, who was traveling, but we were well taken care of by Mr Yashpal (the manager), Mr Devender and Mr Shubham, who were all courteous, ever-smiling and very friendly. They accommodated our request for food items which weren't even on the menu, and we relished the tastiest bowls of Thukpa here. The",soniavad,/Profile/soniavad,"Visakhapatnam (Vizag), India",50

The hotel is a great hub if you wish to visit chitkul, sangla or nearby hill stations.  Rooms - spacious enough for 2-3 people. Every room has a 3 kW heater that should heat the room until -10C. The rooms have dish tv connection, continuous hot water supply, hot water kettle etc.  Food - when we visited in the month of december, winter was on and all we tried was thukpa. The food prepared and served by Devender was very tasty and fresh. Since the hotel operates on a MAP plan, you wont need to pay extra for an additional order.

Anyways, what we lacked in quantity, Prithviraj and his team compensated by sheer quality of their service.  Location: Faces the great Tri-peaks and offers a great view of Kinner Kailash range. The view is even more fascinating from the attic. One may find the hotel situated a little far away from the Kalpa bus stand but to me that was a plus than a minus.
