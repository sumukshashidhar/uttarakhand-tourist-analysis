The views from the private balcony and the windows are breathtaking, to say the least. The staff (Pintu and Abhishek) were extremely courteous,resourceful and made us feel at home. Another point worth mentioning is the food which was excellent,  The hotel is located right below the old Hindustan-Tibet road, and a morning trek to Roghi village on this breathtaking road is highly recommended.

They even have great binoculars which can help in getting a Darshan. Food was great and so was the hospitality. The only point of improvement is perhaps parking of the car etc. We had a tempo traveller and had some trouble getting close to the hotel. The parking of Kalpa is 100 m walk and perhaps facility of luggage pick and drop till there would be helpful.

We had to double-check that we had found the right place. Fortunately, staff were on hand to carry our bags, as the access is not without stumbling blocks.   Check-in was smooth, staff were very friendly, and once we had climbed up all the stairs to our room we were smitten by the views. You could not ask for better. And they were even more breathtaking soon after sunrise.  The hotel also has a large terrace, and it would be easy to spend a whole day just sitting there in the sun and enjoying the views, provided, of course, the sun is shining.  Our room seemed just refurbished and was very large but somewhat bare. It had many windows",lutzy,/Profile/lutzy,"Vaucluse, Australia",40

kinnaur,"It was a mixed experience at the hotel. On one hand the room had a good view and was spacious, on the other hand the room lacked basic amenities like mirror, intercom, hot water kettle, tea/coffee etc. The food was fine in the restaurant but the service was poor. The staff was good and courteous but I assume since there was less staff, the service was very slow. All in all the hotel is decent but it is definitely not worth the money one pays for it. Small advice - hotel entrance doesn’t have any signboard. It’ll be nice to have one near the approach road or outside the hotel itself for guests to easily identity the location.",Apoorv Tomar,/Profile/apoorvtomar,,30

The view from the rooms (which face the mountains) is ecstatic.  Staff is very courteous, the service sometimes is average. For example, there were 3 occasions where they requested us to change the position of our vehicle so that more can be accomodated. No problem this far. We gave our keys to them as they were more experienced in shifting vehicles in such narrow space, and we requested them to return our keys immediately.

The house keeping service provided everything we could want, including the amazing breakfast and the room itself was beautifully clean, spacious, well presented, very well equipped and ideally located.
