kinnaur,"This is a very average property located on the Roghi Road in Kalpa. The only positive about the property is that it has an in-house dining arrangement even though the prices are much on the higher side as compared to other nearby hotels. Views from the balconies are average, but probably better than some of the other nearby hotels. Parking space is not available at the property and markets and restaurants are not nearby.",royjay2018,/Profile/royjay2018,"New Delhi, India",30

kinnaur,We checked into monal residency while on a road trip to kalpa. Beautiful location and a nice cozy place to stay.  Room had gorgeous views of sacred kinner Kailash and we couldn't stop looking at that heavenly sight.  Very cozy room. Food was good. Staff was courteous and we talked about life in kalpa.  Lodge is surrounded by Apple trees all around.  Overall very good place.,Shashank B,/Profile/ShashankB174,,50
