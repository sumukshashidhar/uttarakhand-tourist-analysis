kinnaur,"Clean rooms, warm and delicious food. Situated just ahead of the Nako monastery, this homestay was a pleasant surprise.  Away from the noisy part of the Nako village, this homestay offers a good view of the mountains, valley and is run by an enterprising but shy young local boy.  A huge hall on the groundfloor is kept warm and cozy for dinner. The thukpa I had here was unique and extremely tasty",nimmurao,,"Thane, India",50
