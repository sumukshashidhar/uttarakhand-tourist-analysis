I couldn't have imagined hot running water, an attached bathroom and such comfort in an tent accommodation and in such remote area. Mr.Negi ji exactly knows how to take care of his guests personally. Right from guiding us towards his location late in the night (patiently) to checking if the meals were right to our taste he took personal attention in every detail. The tents are super comfortable and they provide you with super thick and warm blankets to keep you warm. The tents are well insulated with attached bath area. They have 4 bedding options so if you traveling with friends this is the ideal place to stay.

During our stay, we were provided a guide, by the retreat, free of charge! The guide took us around the forest on the other side of the river and the village nearby.

Apple camping a lovely spot to soak in the environment of Sangla. Around the camp are beautiful places to trek around - by the river, around the forest, and the village. Mr. Negi arranged a hotel staff to guide us for the trek. We visited when the season was almost coming to a close and so it was pretty cold. But with the hot bags, blankets and heater in the room, we were pretty alright. The tents are clean and that is such a relief after a long journey to reach there. The bed was comfortable as well.

Breakfast was good without a doubt but the meals were pretty ok. Snacks were also served with an early soup at the bon fire. The arrangement were well made but the quality was lacked. When asked we were said that thy do not get the ingredients on time from Chandigarh due to landslides.. made sense actually.

kinnaur,First of all we went to Sangla Valley in end July when the Monsoons were at their peak. The route was muddy and filled with mud Slush. After an treacherous long journey we finally reached Sangla and what a Beauty it is. Regarding the camp its set in an amazing setting in the middle of an Apple Orchard not right next to the river (which is a good thing you can sleep in peace). The swiss tents are well maintained and are of a decent size with all the basic amenities. People looking for luxury will be surprised by the comfy accommodation and good hospitality by the owner Mr Negi a very down to earth courteous individual. Food is tasty and light and available in good quantities in such a remote place. They also cater to any extra requests by the guests so feel free to speak up be it,Jay1832,/Profile/Jay1832,"New Delhi, India",50
kinnaur,"The stay at Apple Orchard Camps has been the best one so far in any of the camps. its truel blissful being there specially the hospitality being offered by Mr. Negi (Owner of Camps) is truly remarkable. the cleanliness of camps and the lush green apple orchards surroundings were just like cherry on the icing in the lap of nature. one could easily feel the breeze on the face and sound of Baspa river flowing nearby makes the experience even more mesmerizing. with temperatures dropping to 0 degrees at night the chill engulfs you in the iconic snow covered Himalayas. We would recommend everyone to visit the place for sheer joy and love of nature and do stay with Apple Camps, the home cooked like food and hospitality of Mr. Negi is what everyone there talks about most.

Though the owner Mr.Negi is a great person and takes care of his guests personally I feel the place is still not ready to take in so many people.  Some areas of improvement: 1. Food - obviously this is the most important part and we found several gaps here both in quality and quantity. During the rush period one had to wait for food as one item was served tge other got over.  2. Infra - the tents are well maintained tge washrooms are ckean and fresh but there should be an endeavour to bring in some excitement,  games etc for kids.

The blankets, quilts & linens are spotless and off great quality. The toilet is clean & workable enough in a tent.   The food, though limited in variety (expected in such remote location) is hot, freshly prepared and tasty. Moreover, there is continuous supply of fresh apple juice.

Snow capped mountains rising on one side, brown rocky slopes on the other side. The gurgling of Basapa river can be heard in the background, a 10 minute easy walk from the camp, across another camp next door: Banjara.

I pray for all the affected and dead- locals as well as tourists. May God be with them. To reach this camp you have to negotiate wildly winding unmetalled road from Karcham(which is very very exciting for bikers like me). On reaching Sangla,just ask for Banjara camps which is adjacent to Apple orchard; around 7 kms from main town. They haven't put many signboards for directions. Well the camp is very beautiful, located just adjacent to river Baspa and you can hear the wild river gushing in your tents.

Mr Negi and his team run a very efficient camp where they provide home cooked food and willingly pack a picnic basket for excursions to Chitkul and Raksham two nearby villages.
