kinnaur,"I stayed here in October 2017. This is the Monk hotel and not the Camps which I believe would be more luxurious. This property is located on the main road connecting Kalpa with Roghi. It is an Ok property which provides basic facilities. Don't expect any form of luxury in this property, not even a room heater, even in near freezing conditions. There is nothing much to write about the food as well. The fact that there was only 1 staff member at hotel. He was the waiter, receptionist, bell boy, basically he did everything except cook. Thankfully there was a cook who could just about cook. Don't get me wrong even though Kalpa is a small place, it has good hotels. It was our bad luck that we got stuck with this one.",Pankaj Toppo,/Profile/Toppopankaj,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",20

The outside seating area is nice but it was to windy to sit there! The staff was very helpful and polite. We were treated to a delicious dinner and the highlight was the apple kheer. We had our 18 month old baby with us and special food was made for her on request. Breakfast was also good. Special mention to Mr Suresh who made our stay comfortable and memorable.He went out of the way to help us when our car got stuck by another car at the property.

They take hospitality & warmth to a different level. I am an avid traveller & by far the only other place that looks after you so well is Udayvillas - which is a Oberoi property & in a very different price range. Now that I am done with admiration.  The property is built on a ledge facing the mountains. So everyday when you wake up in the morning you wake up to the view of the mountains.

You can just sit outside your tent and spend the day drinking in the sight of the Kinnaur Kailash mountains. And if that wasn't enough, the manager Rawatji took such wonderful care of us that we felt right at home from the start. He and his assistants helped my mother down the path from the carpark to the campsite, brought our food to the room and was there to help us even at 6am!

Had drinks in just lap of mother nature. Hospitality is something, I would give 10 stars at The Monk. Rawat ji is person who can get you anything you want to eat with some special effects as well. Owner, Mr. Negi is really helpful when it comes to something out of the box. If you need an evening with bonfire and drinks, music, food of own choice with a view of snow capped mountains and Kinner Kailash in front of you then this is the only place.

kinnaur,Well Kalpa was a destination we missed out on our earlier spiti circuit so this time we planned for it. Chose The Monk Kalpa camp thanks to tripadvisor and turns out was a great choice. First of all google shows the route to the hotel Monk Kalpa not the camps which are 2 kms beyond the hotel. Parking is available at the site with a 50mtr walk to the camps. The view of Kinner Kailash from the camp is breathtaking especially early morning or evening. The camps itself are clean but for tall travelers beds can be small which i had to deal with otherwise all basic facilities are available. Food is great & homely without being spicy and easy on the tummy. Would mention the famous apple curry and apple parantha is worth a try. Yummy n delicious.

kinnaur,"We stayed for just one night during our long journey to Chitkul-Kalpa from Chandigarh, but That night was PEACEFUL. On a journey/vacation,  one needs eternal silence and nature to make the soul nourished. THis place is will provide you both in exact amount.  Do meet The caretaker, Mr. Prakash. He is a guy with experiences and lot of story. A fireplace, familiar faces, talks. It will help you to rid away the fatigue of travel. We went there to see the famous Sun rise along the Shivling. But we were amazed to see the Moon-rise too :) A view that I cannot forget. Guys, Do carry loads of camera batteries because this Place is Memory. Do Caputure It.  -Robin",robin_who1,/Profile/robin_who1,"Chandigarh, India",50
kinnaur,"We stayed two nights in Monk Kalpa; one night in the newly built hotel and the other in the tent. The location, room amenities, hospitality & food everything was awesome. Special mention to Mr.Gopal Negi, Mr. Prakash and Mr. Sushil Negi who had taken every possible care to make our vacation memorable. Food freshly cooked by Mr. Prakash was homely and healthy. Cleanliness, service & personal touch in every dealing will remain forever in our memory. We always felt as if we were personal guests of Mr. Negi & Mr Praksah. Planning to explore entire tribal circuit of Himachal with Kinnaur Geo Tourism. Recommend all friends to have this experience once.",subhomoy_anubrota,/Profile/subhomoy_anubrota,Kolkata,50
