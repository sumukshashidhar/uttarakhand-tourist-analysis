kinnaur,"We spent a crazy night in June this year at this hotel. We were one of the first ones to check in that day, and the rooms of the hotel were well laid out, with a nice balcony with some chairs, offering a great view of the little town and the lofty peaks all around. But then the evening and the night turned crazy with hoards of people flocking in, and blocking the way in and out. We were lucky to get some very early dinner (prepared in a very homely fashion as we had requested), but after that the other guests drove us crazy. They shouted, and drank and sang till after midnight, forgetting that it was a wooden building and the slightest noise carried. Neither the guests had the basic etiquette to move their vehicles when we wanted to start for Kalpa the next morning. Many of them",Sumana D,/Profile/396sumanad,"Guwahati, India",40
kinnaur,"Our first stop for Spiti Valley. The hotel is decent, well equiped, comfortable rooms, 3-4 charge points, wooden flooring, 2 blankets each. During our stay the lights were off and due to which we had to use cold water in 5Â°. The food was average and the service was very slow.  The owner is warm and nice but the cooking staff is arrogant and rude.   Each room has some unique view. Also Nako lake is at a 5 minute walking distance from the hotel.",Suhani Jagirdar,/Profile/suhanijagirdar,"Surat, India",30

kinnaur,"Please note that there are different types of rooms in this hotel. We stayed on the first floor with field view.  Hotel location is very best. It is within 5 minutes walking distance from Nako lake, and monastery. It is near from meditation point also. Parking is available in the hotel.  Rooms are well furnished and well maintained. Toilets are clean. I was surprised to see this kind of room in such a remote location.  Two things you should NOT MISS if you visit this place. 1. Pizza in this hotel. (Again, i was surprised to see such a well prepared and tasty pizza in Nako village). It was one of the best pizza in our trip.  2. Shpping in the souvenir shop run by a Tibetan lady right in front of this hotel. (Those items and its prices i never found in Kaza or in Manali.  Overall",Trupti,/Profile/Truptichalke,"Mumbai, India",50

Can arrange cabs for further journey. We went by Bus, its nearly 1 km walk in between we had taken a lift in pickup van. Monastery and Nako Lake are at walking distance of 10-15 mins.",Saibal S,/Profile/saibals2016,"New Delhi, India",40
kinnaur,The rooms are average but comfortable and huge enough to accommodate 3-4 adults. The room where we stayed had a huge balcony from where you can look at the Nako village. It is located in the middle of the village and is in close proximity with the shops and eating joints. The staff was courteous and this would be the better off hotels in the small village that is Nako.,abhiadvani19,/Profile/abhiadvani19,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
kinnaur,"The confortable rooms of this hotel are all decorated with wood, which gives them a cosy and clean look. Some of them are equipped with balconies, which must be lovely places to laze in the sun, overlooking the village in summer. The balconies overlook the stones traditional terraces of the village, beautiful.  The staff was lovely, really helped us with care and the food was great.",lorraineAMEB,/Profile/lorraineAMEB,"Paris, France",50
kinnaur,"This was the hotel where I stayed with one of my friend during my trip to Lahaul and Spiti valley. The owner Mr. Bisht is a very funny and nice chap...very talkative and informative too. The rooms have good bathroom with hot water and the balcony has such a beautiful scenic view that one can enjoy whole day sitting in balcony only. Location of this hotel is fantastic..with huge range of mountains, clouds, flags on ethnic houses and beautiful farms..Very very much recommended",Karan Sachan,/Profile/KaranSachan,"Varanasi, India",50
kinnaur,a quiet little hamlet resting on the edge of a very high mountain..cold air rushing about you..greenery very sparse and far between..the young owner of this property has  taken efforts to make the traveller happy .warm and welcome ..great place.,anil paul..,/Profile/anilp81,,40
kinnaur,"Our stay in Naco got extended by 2 days waiting for roads to be cleared after a landslide on the way to Spiti Valley...and there is no better place to stay and drive away the anxieties of waiting other than Reo Purguil.  The way they take care of their visitors and the quality of their services and food compares favorably to any star hotel that we have stayed in.  To be clear, the food and services are basic given that its a remote place and travelers are clear about what to expect from these places. Its more the attitude that we see displayed and the level of care they take to service their guests within the limitations they have.",Raghunathan_GR,/Profile/Raghunathan_GR,"Bengaluru, India",50
kinnaur,Should be one of the best place to stay at Nako. Lots of biking groups stay here as you can see from their stickers on their entry door. The room was quite big and spacious. Decently clean too. The bathroom is also pretty good with all facilities. Friendly staff - atleast I didn't face any problem.  The views from the rooms are spectacular. My room also had a balcony with full rooms size windows. The place was also not noisy at all. Considering the location they are also priced low infact. They have dedicated parking so that is a good thing though there is no problem whatsoever even if you leave your car in open in this village. A very good experience.,Shashiks,/Profile/Shashiks,"Bengaluru, India",50
kinnaur,"Excellent hospitality,food, room cleanliness and service. You get all these at the best rates. Very beautiful, quiet and far from crowded place  Staff is extremely helpful and sweet, overall peaceful place for nature lovers.",Neeraj Dhiman,/Profile/ND0777,"Shimla, India",50
kinnaur,"In our entire nine-days trip, where we stayed at eight hotels, this was easily the worst. The hotel was aware we would be arriving around lunch time & yet they did not have lunch prepared for us. The staff did not seem to care about it either. In the evening, we asked them if they could serve chicken for dinner; they refused. Later, the other guests, a German couple, mentioned to us that they were having chicken for dinner at the hotel. I guess we were not white enough! The staff was rude & nonchalant throughout. We got no help in loading & unloading our luggage from the car either. Only saving grace was the location which made the market accessible on foot.",Let's Go Sightseeing,/Profile/LetsGoSightseeing,"Noida, India",20
kinnaur,"On our road trip to Tabo, we had a halt of one night at Nako. The hotel is excellent considering the remote location. Rooms are spacious and well maintained. Washrooms are large and clean. We could access running hot water for the duration of the stay. Family rooms have an extra bed available and can accommodate up to 4 members easily. Our room had an attached balcony which provided some nice views. Food available at the property was tasty. There is a wide variety available as they cater to foreign tourists also. You will need to give a little buffer time for the cook to prepare but the quality is very good. Portions are also fairly large. Service during our stay was excellent. Staff were helpful and always had a smile on their face. Reasonable amount of Parking space is",Partha Pain,/Profile/parthapain,"Mumbai, India",50
kinnaur,The hotel is pretty good and you dont find such hotels in the area you're travelling. I would recommend travelers to consider option for stay as well as for eating meals. The service is pretty slow due to the lack of commodities in the area. The rooms are very good and have a great view. The pricing is also good. The food is again very good but its just the long time it takes to arrive. The staff is very helpful and nice and over all the hotel was good.,Muskan,/Profile/muzzzk,"New Delhi, India",50
kinnaur,Rooms were cozy! best stay for families. We get hot water anytime and they have good varieties of food available in the menu. Cook is very nice to customers. He understands  the taste of customer and cooks accordingly. This hotel can be rated as luxury hotel in NAKO.,Nikhil s,/Profile/Nikhils1789,,40
kinnaur,"We got a great room with amazing views from the balcony. The caretaker Manish made sure that our stay is comfortable. There was no electricity which made our stay in this remote village even better. The rooms are spacious with great wood work. When in Nako, stay in this hotel without any worries.",pratik_bhaumik,/Profile/pratik_bhaumik,"New Delhi, India",50
kinnaur,At such a altitude what else you can expect than a neat and clean hotel with good fresh food. Stay at this hotel during my recent trek to Kaza. Stayed overnight. Sleep quality was quite okey. Hotel is on main road. Parking available.,lotusdiamond,/Profile/lotusdiamond,"New Delhi, India",40
kinnaur,This hotel is the best option at Nako. Right in front of the market / bus stand with options of shops (a luxary there!) in your doorsteps. Newly built especially the first floor with wooden wall and flooring. Food is also good and very tasty too. The caretaker (Manish) took very good care of us was very prompt in service.,SauravBanerjee,/Profile/SauravBanerjee,"Kolkata, India",40
kinnaur,This hotel in comfortable and pretty new as it was built in 2001. Prices are already expensive but the season will be pretty short considering the location and the altitude. My room was large and clean plus the bathroom was also large and well set. This is the luxury option in Nako. Other places offer tiny rooms with a rock solid bed. This is a restaurant downstairs but there are also other very good options across the street.,lucsky,/Profile/lucsky,"Ham Tien, Vietnam",30
