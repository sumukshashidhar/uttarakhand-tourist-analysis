kinnaur,"Uses both Lovon and Loven on their signs. This guest house is mentioned in Indian travel blogs, particularly for the food, which was good but not exceptional. Room was clean with nice view of farm/garden (same owner) as well as mountains. Outlet didn't work so I moved to Reo.....across the street; Tashi Delek across the street seems to have better food.",RichfromDC,/Profile/RichfromDC,DC,30
kinnaur,"We spent a night at Lovon enroute to Kaza and it was perfect. A simple place right at the entry of Nako village, Lovon has its own parking and restaurant.  Our rooms were on the first floor towards the back and had the most stunning view of green fields of peas and the mountains. The rooms were basic but spotlessly clean with nice-sized bathrooms and hot water was available from the electric geyser.",Anchor8,/Profile/Anchor8,"New Delhi, India",40
kinnaur,"Nice clean rooms,  good food.  The host takes pride in serving the guests.  In fact the whole village takes pride in helping the guests.  Room service is good. Try the local cuisine available with them. Amazing view from the rooms. ",Sid P,/Profile/952sidp,,50
kinnaur,"I had read a lot for the food being served here and it was surely the best i had on the trip to spiti valley.  The owner and his family are very good people, they run a budget stay and this one is the 1st homestay as you enter Nako Village. They charged us 200 per person for stay , hot water available, good eds and warm blankets, this what you look when you are in Spiti Valley.  I would recommend to stay here and Practically i have seen on this route of Spiti Valley we dont come to stay in Resorts, enjoy the warmth of home stay and food they prepare with so much love.  One more thing i would like to mention is there is small shop next to this place which has every possible item a shopkeeper can keep and this guy sells everything at the MRP, this really shows how genuine and",Nilesh1980,/Profile/Nilesh1980,"Pune, Maharashtra, India",50
kinnaur,"Best Tibetan food we ate on our trip (Delhi-Kibber-Losar-Delhi). Momos, Veg Thukpa and Ginger-Lemon-Honey Tea are must-haves. You'll get budget rooms in the â‚¹300-600 bracket. It's located near major grocery stores. It has a very pretty view too!",AB9,/Profile/Abhipsit,"New Delhi, India",30
