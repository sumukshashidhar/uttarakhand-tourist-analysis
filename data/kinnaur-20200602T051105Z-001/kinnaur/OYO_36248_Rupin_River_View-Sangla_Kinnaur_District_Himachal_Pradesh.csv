kinnaur,"Please treat this review as a warning for staying here at your own risk. We had a booking for 2 rooms at this hotel in Oct 2019. But surprisingly on arrival, we came to know that the entire hotel is booked for a marriage and so our stay was at another hotel (Rakchham Cottage) which had a side facing view of the river. This was the beginning of our experience with the cheaters. The room service was pathetic, and even the TVs did not work. On inquiring about basic hotel services, a drunk man came out of the kitchen and started abusing us. Never ever had such a horrible experience in a hotel. The owner threatened to throw our luggages out of the hotel that night itself. We understood that we are in wrong hands. We had elderly parents with us too. We checked out the next day morning",Srimonta,/Profile/duttasrimonta,,10
kinnaur,The hotel offers the best view of Baspa river and village and is located in a serene location. The hospitality can be improved and management can be accommodative of guest requests. Based on travel time etc guests might reach late and exhausted but they are very strict about food serving timing etc. Since we could not reach and wake up in right time we had to adjust with cold and dry food. We have stayed at other hotels at various locations during SPiti trip and they were flexible as the place and climate itself needs it.,mamathajk,/Profile/mamathajk,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",30
kinnaur,"I stayed in the property in the first week of Oct , 2019 (2-3 rd ) with my family. Firstly the hotel was under renovation and not in habitable condition for a family when I visited. It may work out for a couple or bachelor, but not very secured for a family at this condition ( if they finish the repair work in 2-3 months period, then I should not comment) . I booked a 3 bedded room @ Rs 5000/- from Booking.com. When we reached at night around 8 PM, the hotel was in unrecognizable condition (compared to the photo I saw in booking.com before 3 months) as the repair work was on . The room they offered was beside the river, so location wise it was awesome.. But room air conditioning was not good enough to protect the cold (appx 0-4 degrees Celcius).

There are number of nice tented camps, but the Hotel Rupin River View and the affiliated restaurant is just great. Welcoming and with arguably the best view around it def. is a good value for the money. The restaurant did not disappoint with local foods.

The only trouble is place called ""Rupin river view"". This is not a hotel. It is nothing like shown in the pictures of the property on the holidy booking sites. In my view, it is a set of lodging locations, packaged into a single name and sold to travellers  just based on some fake pictures.
