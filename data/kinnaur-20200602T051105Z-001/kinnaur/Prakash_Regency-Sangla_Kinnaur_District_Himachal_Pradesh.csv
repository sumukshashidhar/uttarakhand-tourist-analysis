FOOD QUALITY WAS PERFECT FITTING WITH PEOPLES DIFFERENT TASTES! i recommend prakash regency for better stay in sangla... one problem with the hotel is that it lacks a generator and an inverter! people interested in NATURE ONLY should ignore this problem....family with small children should not go if their children like playing on slides! to worship nature choose this only!",Bodybuilder 124,/Profile/Safari806950,,40

kinnaur,"Stayed in this hotel on 7th october,2014. Around 2 km. from the city market area. The hotel is quite new with the modern amenities. Rooms are cozy enough though not very big. Bathroom is well fitted with modern toiletries. The only problem we faced was that of hot water which was available only after 6 pm. The food quaility was also very good.  The owner Mr. Mohan prakash and his father are very hospitable. They showed their apple orchard surrounding the hotel which was a treat to watch. Overall one can enjoy the green Sangla valley and the luscious Kinner apple trees by staying in this hotel.",201411pp,/Profile/201411pp,"Naihati, West Bengal, India",40

Rooms are very clean and comfortable (after a week living in tents, anything looks comfortable, this was really good). Food was excellent with an unlimited supply of apples to go with it. The hotel is in the midst of an orchard and is pleasant on the eye. Don't miss buying their apples (golden and red delicious) which are awesome.",KrishnanN,/Profile/KrishnanN,"Adyar, India",40

Since there was delay of about 15 days in apple season, I was assured that I will get these apples home delivered.",Singhee A,/Profile/asinghee,jaipur,40
kinnaur,"An average looking hotel from the outside but with views to die for, especially the rooms overlooking the valley. Dont expect 5star standard service, facilities and food. However, for the remote location and price its quite impressive. To make your experience more memorable ask the propertier to show you his orchards with its red and golden apples. You could also get a superb bargain for a crate of his sweet apples.",BRAT525B,/Profile/BRAT525B,BANGALORE,50

Food quality was also very nice. you can't expect this type of good hotel in that non-commercialized beautiful place. Owner was also very supportive. He made booking arrangements in other places for us which were planned by us in our trip also. They have their own garden at backyard. We were served strawberries, apples etc. which are plucked by their own garden. Behavior of all hotel staff was very good and supportive.

kinnaur,"First of all, let me clarify that Hotel Prakash regency and Hotel Prakash are 2 different hotel across the road, though owned by same people. The left one in the photo is regency. We stayed in Hotel Prakash (the right one) in rooms overlooking the road (and the regency). Let me start with the good things. The best part of our stay was the prompt services. There was just one guy running to all the rooms(on 2 floors) and trying his best to provide good service. Initially we had to struggle to get towels and water as the guy was busy showing rooms to other guests. Overall, the staff is polite and helpful. The food was good but portion size was one of the smallest I have ever seen. We had to order twice the number of main course veges that we usually do. We were served strawberries",Priyanka_Voyager,/Profile/Priyanka_Voyager,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40

In terms of  vfm it is also good.Their manager Mr raman is  a nice person who gave us a good deal for staying there.He is quite helpful and an asset of prakash regency.He even helped us selecting food during our stay. For the first time in my life i ate asparagus which is cultivated in their own farm. Food is also best what we have had in in our entire trip of Kinnaur region.

The service is also quite good. The food served is tasty and readily available.  Mr Mohan Prakash is very friendly and always ready to guide you at any time. Hospitality will always attract...  The taxi service is readily available as per your needs.  I recommend to stay here and enjoy the Baspa valley by staying either in Prakash Guest House or in Prakash Regency.

Service by Mr Raman and Mr Mohan was excellent. There was a problem with hot water, which was a dampener because of the really freezing cold weather. But nothing unmanageable. They provided hot water in buckets. The food has scope for improvement.  If camp sites aren't really your thing, then this is your best option. Reasonably priced too.",SarikaPeriwal,/Profile/SarikaPeriwal,"Mumbai, India",40

The hotel is surrounded by apple trees and gives you a great view of nature. This property is simply the best in the region and much more economical and customizable than the much hyped Banjara retreat. the food is great and rooms are well built and spacious.,Saurabh B,/Profile/saurabhbassi,"Shimla, India",50

All hotels were closed, and he was gracious enough to allow us accommodation in Prakash Regency as only guests. His hospitality is really warm and infectious.   The food is great, the view is stunning and you will be treated with delicious lovely golden apples to eat and packed for onward journey. The pricing is reasonable. The problem of not being able to operate both geyser and room heater ( can't complain because you are not suppose to visit Sangla at these times) was there but Mr. Mohan gave us an additional heater from his own residence. I would always recommend this hotel.",swastik73,/Profile/swastik73,"Kolkata, India",40

The view from all the rooms is spectacular. Therefore, it is really nice that all rooms have balconies. The breakfast is amazing and all the food is good. Their asparagus sabzi is to die for. The added advantage is the chats you can have with Senior Prakash. He works all day looking after the fruit trees, strawberries, asparagus and just about everything he grows. Just as we were leaving, he came with 2 packets of strawberries for my daughters (the first strawberries of the season). It was a nice warm, fuzzy feeling we had while driving away.

All the facilities were not up and running when we were there but could make out from the setup that this will be the place to stay in Sangla during the coming summers. The new hotel is well furnished, clean, and rooms are cozy and comfortable with all modern facilities. They also have a lovely reception, common room and dining on the ground floor with a big screen TV. Watching sports here with fellow travelers should be a fun experience.  There service is top notch. Food preparation and quality is excellent. They also have a good number of different cuisines and dishes available in their menu.
