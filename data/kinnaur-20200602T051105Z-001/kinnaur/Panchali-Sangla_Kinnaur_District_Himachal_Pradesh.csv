kinnaur,"LET ME TELL ME YOU ABOUT THE CONS OF THIS HOTEL.  1. You have to wait for almost 2 hours in shivering cold for check in,no mercy even shown to elderlies.   2. Rooms are pathetic ,dust and dirty , bathrooms are not clean and with full of foul smell.  3. behaviour of the staffs there are so rude you can't even imagine.  4. You have to go to eat in the nearby hotel as late as 10.30 in the night with a walk of 5 mins in cold.  5. they have turned the beautiful chitkul into hell with their wastes.  6. each and every thing you will ask for you will have an excuse for not getting it.  7.Even if you like to leave the hotel ,they will Throw you some hard words ,like you will marooned in  this no man's land.  Chtikul has only a tea shop,nearby eating house is at at Rakhcham 14 kms,Sangla",RoyzDen,/Profile/RoyzDen,"Kolkata, India",10
kinnaur,"Reached this resort in the beautiful valley of chitkul on 6th october,2014. A decent hotel in an area devoid of the basic infrastructure. Rooms are not small though not very modern. Bathroom in the hotel is good with the geyser facilities though we heard from other boarders that they were given only buckets of hot water. The hotel has a restaurant with good food qualities. Particularly Bengali tourists will find pleasure to get tasty foods from the Bengali cheff in the restaurant. The hotel is located at an ideal place just in front of the beautiful Baspa valley. One can enjoy a light stroll in the early morning beside the Beas river and the sunrise. We enjoyed our one night stay in this hotel.",201411pp,/Profile/201411pp,"Naihati, West Bengal, India",30
kinnaur,"we stayed here in October 2014 for one night...we booked from debbhumi travels Kolkata....their service was horrible from start...we made full payment for booking but when we reached chitkul, we were told by the hotel managers that they only have informations about one rooms while we booked and paid for two rooms... after showing booking slip and much persuation they gave us a room which was used by their own people,not used for guests as all other rooms were already occupied... small clumsy rooms...one proper room had geyser,but that makeshift room didn't have geyser...we had to fetch it from that other room...they didn't have tv but who need tv in such a beauty of a place.... food was available in panchali itself...but hardly had much option and that too overpriced...that",rajarshi r,/Profile/rajarshir749,"Kolkata, India",30
kinnaur,"Stayed there in JUNE 2014 for one night.Rooms are basic,dirty & badly maintained.Service is real bad.The location is really great though.They don't serve foods(other than tea) in this hotel and one will have to go to the SAHENSAH RESORT(run by the same management ; the single manager--some Mr.Ghosh, of these 2 hotels was at the reception of that hotel) for lunch/dinner/breakfast.   Try to avoid this hotel/Stay there only if you are left with no other option.",SANDIPAN D,/Profile/anadi2014,"Haldia, India",20
kinnaur,"A poor hotel in a great location. Leaking tap, damp and cracked wall,very basic amenities no television although there is one in the reception to disturb nearby rooms and foods are served in adjecent hotel although tea is available in rooms.in  morning water was not availble in ground floor rooms .  Better you stay in Sangla or Rakcham and vistit it in day time unless you are eager to stay in a high altitude(3385m according to my watch) place.",Nabendu B,/Profile/nabendub2014,,10
kinnaur,"There is not much to say about this hotel other than its location, it is the last building of chitkul, which is the last village at Indo-Tibetan border. You will get a panoramic view of the snow clad mountains & Baspa river, just from the hotel. It is a budget hotel & facilities were provided accordingly. We had to face a prolong power cut & had to manage without generator support, even hot water was not available during power cuts. There was erratic water supply also during the morning hours. But at a far off village like chitkul, just on the lap of nature, these were very small problems, from the very first moment throughout our stay we were just awed by the beuty of the nature & the hotel was never a bottleneck in that. Service was good & food was also palatable. Despite of",Pijush,/Profile/Pijush,Jamshedpur,30
