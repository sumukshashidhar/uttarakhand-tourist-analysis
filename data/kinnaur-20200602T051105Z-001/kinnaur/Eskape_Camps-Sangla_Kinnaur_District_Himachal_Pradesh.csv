kinnaur,"Loved every bit of by stay the Campsite...its unlike any other camsite i have ever visited. For starters, they don't promote Borfire , because it's 100% carbon neutral and runs on solar, which I thought was a great idea. It's run by kinnaur person, so u let to know a lot about their culture... Recomended to everyone..",Phani,/Profile/Phanivr,,50

kinnaur,"Amazing Camping Experience. This camp is situated slightly away (approx 200 m) from main road and the main river, giving it a calm and pleasant environment. The view from the camp is mesmerizing with a calm stream flowing and a grass platue across the stream where cattles graze. Mt. Soshla peak can be seen right from the camp along with other peaks without any obstacle. If you are a Photographer and love landscape timelapses or sunrise and sunset. There is no place like this in whole Rakcham. I loved this place.",Ajit Kayastha,/Profile/AjitKayastha,"Noida, India",50
kinnaur,"This place came across to me as one of the most perfect places to spend your vaccation in solitude.With an amazing hill view and lush greenery around,it gives a treat for your eyes. An ideal place for photography as well and must say hospitality is at its best.",Sandeep S,/Profile/sandeepsY4505BN,,50
kinnaur,"The breathtaking location can make you feel you are in a fairy land. There is beautiful stream following just opposite the camps along with a grass land. The camps are very unique with attach bathrooms and very clean. The food is satisfactory.  Behavior of the staff is upto the mark. They use solar energy,so hey we are not leaving any carbon footprints. I can visit this place 100 more times without even thinking twice. And yes this place is heaven for photographers.  Cherry on cake is the amazing host Mr.Negi who will take you for a hike/trek in the evening and in the morning he will make you do light exercise/yoga as you please. You can sit by him all day and gain all the mountain knowledge he has to offer.  I will recommend everyone this place.",Itey,/Profile/Iteybharara,,50

kinnaur,"This place is simply beautiful, feels like gulmarg. The campsite is right in-front of the Glaciers. There is ample space for kids to play and they have a fish pond also. Management is really cooperative, On our request they arrange for local potatoes and peas vegetable [ Potato's of Rakcham are world famous ].  The management is energy conscious and runs the entire campsite on Solar...  Keep up the good work",Woundering_Soule,/Profile/Woundering_Soule,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
