kinnaur,"I have stayed in this hotel in Oct 2019. The rooms are not upto the mark, lacking modern upkeep. Most importantly the reason why a tourist comes to Kalpa is to have a stunning view of the mountain ranges, which is absolutely a flop if you stay in this hotel. The hotel does not offer a complete view of the mountains, and the Kailash Shivling is not at all visible from this hotel. To top it up, there is a 3 storied building and trees in front of Hotel White Nest to block its view. There are many better choices in Kalpa to stay, so just avoid it. And finally, the owner of this hotel is a rude person and does not have the sense how to treat their guests.",Srimonta,/Profile/duttasrimonta,,10
kinnaur,The stay was absolutely comfortable. We had the 4th floor the view and stunning rooms were at our escape. Food is good. We had buffet breakfast and dinner. Breakfast has all that you need. We were overwhelmed with the sweet Shira with hot roties made at request at Dinner. Loved the warmness of the staff and overall ambience. A black furry dog visits the floor at night. You definitely got to see him. ,Suhani Jagirdar,/Profile/suhanijagirdar,"Surat, India",50
kinnaur,"The hotel is situated overlooking the kinnaur-kailash range. The rooms are clean. The water heater is excellent, churns out really good hot water. The staff are friendly. The food is very good. If you come to kalpa and ask for chicken 65, I don't think you would be satisfied. But, instead, if you ask for local chicken dish you would be more than satisfied.

kinnaur,"This hotel is a budget hotel, neat and clean situated at Roghi Road in kalpa. The hotel staff is very cooperative and food provided is also very nice. In hilly area always try to get the front side room for clear visibility and also try to get the room on third or fourth floor. From this hotel, the Kinoor Kailash is just seems opposite to the hotel. There is a bodh math and old Hindu temple in Kalpa which is 10 minutes walk from this hotel.",kschouhan,/Profile/kschouhan,"Jaipur, India",40
kinnaur,"The hotel is situated in Kalpa having good clean and spacious  rooms. Moreover, it's value for money hotel. The staff are friendly and helpful. Family travelling with four or more members can have homely stay here. Only wish was availability of wi-fi. ",MukeshBiswas,/Profile/MukeshBiswas,,30
kinnaur,Hotel rooms stink of humidity  laden bedding. Food quality terrible. Bengali cook doesn't understand difference between vegetarian and Non veg food. Dingy kitchen. Please avoid this property. Only grace is you can have view of Kinner Kailash that too if you dare to climb under construction roof top. ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,Chopra_Par,/Profile/Chopra_Par,"New Delhi, India",10
