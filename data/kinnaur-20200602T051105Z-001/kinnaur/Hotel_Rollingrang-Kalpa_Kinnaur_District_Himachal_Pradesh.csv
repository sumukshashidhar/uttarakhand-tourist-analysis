kinnaur,This was my second stay in Kalpa and Rollingrang exceeded all the expectations. The owner Mr. Negi and his team is fantastic and I can’t thank him enough for all his help. Will surely come back. I was touched as one of my friend forgot his hot water bottle and Mr. Negi mentioned that he will courier it for us free of cost. He took initiative and called us and did the needful.  The food was really fantastic and everything was so fresh and team served us with their heart. I am so thankful and touched and do not have enough words to express my gratitude. The view with balcony room is to die for and in winters we were in balcony to enjoy the lovely view and appreciate the nature. No doubt the best property and best service and looking forward to go back.,Rohit J,/Profile/rohitj104,Maldives,50

kinnaur,One of the best service ever received in life. The person name Mohit who is the owner is very helpful. The hotel is located at the prime location from where you can view kinnaur kailash. The view from hotel room is also sublime. You wake up looking at mountains covered with snow. Mr Mohit guided us on the entire tour of kinnaur. He provided us all the information he could to reach the destination. Coming to food part being a vegetarian I can vouch for the food. It's truly amazing. One won't be disappointed with any service provided by hotel staff. They treat like a family. Amazing stay. Will definitely visit Rolling rang again.,Shrirang,/Profile/Shritravelfreak,,50

Superb view from rooms, so a plus point of the great location. Food was satisfactory, breakfast was served in the open which was very very pleasant and the best part of the stay. Hotel staff was a bit disappointing. Among-st our all stays in Himachal, this was the only place which lacked that welcoming nature, may be due to the fact that their hotel was full and could not pay close attention to all guests.",Divya J,/Profile/DivyaJ2512,,30
kinnaur,It is one of the most strategically located and beautifully maintained hotel of Kalpa. It’s built beside the HPDTC bungalow and amidst an apple orchard. The complete Kinner Kailash range is visible from the mountain facing rooms. And won’t make a hole in your pocket due to its reasonable tariffs.  Staffs are professional. They would do as requested but won’t go extra mile to give you a better experience. Food is fine but the chef needs to be more consistent with the taste. Can even screw up maggi!,ADAich,/Profile/ADAich,"New Delhi, India",40
kinnaur,"First of all, I would like to thank Mr. Mohit Nego and team for being the host of a wonderful holiday.  The hotel, set in the lap of Himalayas, with full view of Konnar Kailash rannge and added attraction is they have their own apple orchard , surrounding the hotel. I have visited all over the India, but never seen such a hotel which never means only business; travellers hospitality and comfort is their main moto.  Kneatly maintained rooms, comfy beds, hygienic toilet, super cooked foods; all over the polite and helpful behaviour of the staffs, I have got everything. As per my driver's feedback, the drivers accommodation is also best among all hotels in Kinnaur Kailash route.  Recommend for all types of travellers.

He was sweet enough to take demands of a 15 member biking group which was along with me. Our demand of having local food was also met at a very short notice.

kinnaur,The Hotel rooms are not that great but are clean and tidy with basic facilities. The rooms with open balcony are worth staying especially 2nd floor rooms. The front side rooms offers excellent and uninterrupted view of the snow capped mounatins even while lying down on your bed.  The rooms at the back side doesn't have a view at all. The hospitability of the staff was good.  We ordered veg Manchurian and veg Chowmein and both the things were equally bad.,Megha G,/Profile/TravellerMegs2014,Delhi,30
kinnaur,"I did not stay at this lodge but had my daily meals at the restaurant of the hotel. It is surrounded by apples orchards with views of snow clad mountains on one side. The cook Prithvi makes such delicious and lip-smacking food. His egg pakoda and kadhai chicken are to die for. The chicken is also fresh and the local mountain goat better known as pahadi bakri is also a treat to the taste buds. One needs to inform the cook in advance to enable him to purchase the meat and cook it fresh. The ginger black tea is also brewed brilliantly. The manager/ caretakers Mr. Thakur and Mr. Jitender are very accommodating and polite. Food was served hot and steamy and every effort was made to ensure the best, customized and yummy meals",Jonathan_Donald,/Profile/Jonathan_Donald,"New Delhi, India",30
kinnaur,"My wife booked this hotel for 2 nights on the 7th and 8th day of October, 2014 after sending email to the co-owner Naresh Jishtu. As per his demand, I deposited 50% of total amount Rs. 4000 for 2 days, that is, Rs. 2000 as advance to his bank account for one mount view room on the top floor. Naresh Jishtu sent a confirmation mail acknowledging the receipt. My wife also talked to him various time over phone. He assured that one mount view room on the top floor will be kept reserved for us.  After reaching Kalpa, when my wife called Naresh Jishtu, it was a utter surprise for us !  Naresh Jishtu told us that our room has been kept reserved at Sangla !!!  By mistake, he could not keep our room at Kalpa !!!  The mystery was revealed  when we entered the Rollingrang hotel.

kinnaur,"First thing about the hotel.....the location and the view......awesome!!!! Easily comparable.....maybe even better than the HPTDC property which is right next to it, albeit a lot cheaper. Property is moderately new; rooms are spacious, neat bedding and a large balcony which offers a delightfully refreshing view of the majestic Kinner Kailash, literally 180 degree view. See the panorama photo I have attached. We booked 2 top floor rooms, well in advance from Mr. Naresh Jishtu, who booked our entire trip to Kinnaur along with hotel in Sangla and Car. Would highly recommend his services. The staff is very co-oporative....Pratap, Prithwi and the rest. Food is okay, menu has variety and reasonably priced. Try the Kashmiri Potato with butter, good dish. The property is sarrounded with",Souvik Majumder,/Profile/SouvikMajumder,"Kolkata, India",40
kinnaur,Adjacent to HPTD hotel. Has excellent view of Kailash Kinner Mountains. Simple food as per your choice if told in advance. Rate of room approx 1000/- to 1500/- as per view of the Kailash Kinner. Seperate dining area. Spacious rooms. Got refrence from local known person. Value for money to stay here. Morning walk on the road was very good. Meteorological Observatorty is nearby. A temple is on the hill side. A 10-15 minutes track is worth going there.

kinnaur,"The guest house is away from the road so very peaceful. The view of the snow mountains is magnificent. There is car parking space too.A family with a toddler and a baby and a maid, we had a comfortable stay. Except for some loud drunkards who came in the night and made a racket so we told the two member staff to control the noise since they were their fellow friends working from other hotels around.",zendhian,/Profile/zendhian,"New Delhi,  India",40
