kinnaur,I was with my family in chitkul and was looking for a room. We saw this place. Went to the reception. Waited for 15 minutes but no one was their. Took a round with other hotels and came back to zostel again. The guy showed me the room this time. I told him i came earlier as well. This kind of striked the guy that we din find a hotel and he told us 3 times the rate. He told the room for 3000. However in front of me some guys paid him 1100 for the room. So yes.. they are very greedy and try to take advantage of the customers. We finally went to hotel sama and had a pleasant stay.,Kanika S,/Profile/KanikaS195,"Shimla, India",10
kinnaur,"Reaching Chitkul at times could be a little painful considering the roads and distance but once you reach, its totally worth it. Zostel Chitkul is situated at the far end of Chitkul just next to the river. I think there could not be a better location when you can dine in and gaze at the mountains and listen to river in the background. Everything was amazing in our stay from clean rooms, to courteous hosts, supreme location and friendly village people around. Only note to all travelers to Chitkul is that there is no mobile range or internet in that area. So be prepared. Heard JIO is coming to Chitkul by end of Aug, 19. So all sorted. I would come back again for sure for a longer stay. This time i had only 1 night stay.",mpriyam,/Profile/mpriyam,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50

The quality of food offered, the hospitality and the friendly nature of staff made me realise i was actually missing a lot from my travelling tales. Talk about comfort, you'll be amazed by the quality of bunk bends and the cleanliness of rooms. Also, It allows you to connect with many different people from different backgrounds, cultures.

kinnaur,"Zostel, Chitkul  An overly delayed review which I was supposed to write couple of months ago. Nevertheless, I wanted to put down few words at earliest as this place deserves so.   Location   Chitkul is the tiniest village and it’s not difficult to locate this place (Zostel) as it lies along the Chitkul-Nagasthi road. Once you enter, keep moving on the same road and you can find Zostel on your right hand side.   Rooms & View  As far as I remember, there were two private rooms (double bed with attached washroom), 4 four-bedded dormitories and two camps. We (me & my wife) stayed in a private room. The room was basic but extremely clean with fresh linens and towels. The attached washroom had a geyser and again, it was very clean.

Thankfully, all the windows from Zostel open to the valley and you get to see the river and the snow clad mountains (if it’s not too cloudy) from your rooms and not the buildings that are forming at the back of it. The place is done up well especially the common room which is nice and cosy. It includes a tv, some indoor games, guitar etc. We stayed in a room and not a dorm, and the room was basic with an attached w/c. The primary part- it was neat and comfy. The staff was friendly. The blessing in disguise was that most of the networks were not working (except BSNL, although the manager, Nitish was kind enough to lend his phone to call at home) so people came out from the virtual world",Manasi B,/Profile/manasib2016,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40

If you are looking for a place, where you don't have to think about anything except for what you want to explore next in the mountains. Visit Chitkul. My selling point for this trip was that there is zero network connectivity and Zostel Chitkul made sure that it was not a problem.  You feel safe there, you feel that finally you are home. #ChitkulGotTheCool",Aanchal Jagta,/Profile/Aanchaljagta,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
kinnaur,"I have stayed at a decent number of backpacker dorms, but none with such views, cleanliness or hospitable staff and also at such decent prices. If you are staying back in Chitkul, Zostel should be your first pick for accommodation.",Curiosity637660,/Profile/Curiosity637660,,50

kinnaur,"Perfect and pocket friendly stay for the travellers. Rooms are cozy and equipped with all facilities to keep you warm in temperatures dropping below zero. Staff was young teens of our age with very friendly behaviour. The hostel alos offers the bycycle which was the best deal for us to ride and checkout the India's first Line of defense (check post) which was 3kms from the hostel. We got to see the most scenic view of the mountains. However, parking facility, microwave oven, 24*7 coffee vending machine and water dispense machine shall be provided which are the basic facilities of every hostel.",Abhishek G,/Profile/AbhishekG1834,,40

kinnaur,"Zostel Chitkul was my first Zostel stay experience, and nothing could’ve made it more memorable. I have only wished and waited to visit Zostel Chitkul since the time it’s been around social media pages. And when I was finally there, it looked much beautiful than how I imagined it to be. Two of my friends & I chose female dorm room & we thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. Common room of Zostel Chitkul was the best part of our stay. The staff & team Zostel Chitkul were super friendly & generous, they made us comfortable. Made some new friends & cuddled some love with zostel dogs. 😍  The view from Zostel & Cafe Chitkool is to die for. I mean, you’re literally sipping a cup of tea infront of a landscape beauty. Could’ve have asked for more. The chef cooked some real good food for",Khushboo S,/Profile/KhushbooShah26,"Bengaluru, India",50

kinnaur,"location of zostel chitkul gives out of poster feel, you can see the mountains right from your room. Baspa river is at walking distance and spending time at the bank will make you go wow. Food is great, though options are limited ( Considering its the last village , you can discount that )...",Surendra P,/Profile/SurendraP211,,50

kinnaur,"Me and my friends stayed at this property for 3 days. We arrived in the night very late with no view of the valley at sight. What we saw in the morning was beyond words. Moreover, every morning we witnessed a new view. The property is placed such that it gives one a direct 360 view of the valley. People there are very warm and hospitable. They are very lively and acting, out there to help you all the time. Before visiting this property I had read in some reviews that the food was bad. I kid you not, they serve amazing Indian food. Sachin at the kitchen has magic in his fingers, he cooks the best butter chicken. I would highly recommend you guys to visit Zostel chitkul and I am personally really looking forward to visit it once again for a longer stay.",anu b,/Profile/anub217,,50
kinnaur,"The place it self says that your chit (soul) will feel cool over here. The place has very less accommodation, but thanks to Zostel for coming up with a really cool place to stay. The staff is very friendly, you will feel as if you are part of a family. The food and the view at Zostel Chitkul are the highlights for me. The manager of the place is really helpful and welcoming. The dorms are clean and spacious and you actually get to sleep on really good mattresses. The open air cafe of Zostel is purely a heaven to have a meal during sunset time. If you get to visit this place stay only at Zostel light on pockets but really heavy on memory (in a good way, lol).",Ashvin Tyagi,/Profile/Ashvin1503,"Noida, India",50
kinnaur,"I visited Chitkul in the end of the June along with my friends. We didn't make any mistake by booking the zostel. Zostel Chitkul is located almost in the end of the village. It will provide you the best view of snow covered mountains. We were touched by the hospitality of the owner. Food was also amazing. This is the place where I'd like to stay again undoubtedly. Zostel Chitkul provides the best view, accomodation, hospitality and the food. I'll recommend it for sure.",Paras B,/Profile/ParasB103,,50
kinnaur,I’m glad to recommended Zostel Chitkul for everyone and my trip would have been incomplete without Zostel. It’s is just fantastic in terms of the area they have and the location. The ambience in the night is something to die for. The dorms are neat with running hot/warm water. Initially I had plans of moving another river side camping In chitkul  but I ended up making Zostel my stay.Also you end up meeting many travelers across that it’s a perfect place to party under the stars.The staff is very helpful and smiley too and they make such yum food.,Raju K,/Profile/RajuK605,"New Delhi, India",50
kinnaur,"Its a amazing place for the bag packers & for solo travelers. You can find the heaven within you !! “I like the mountains because they make me feel small,' Jeff says. 'They help me sort out what's important in life.”   Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious experience. Special thanks to Nitin, Vipin, Kush, Avinash, Vikram, Chef Sharma Ji & entire Zostel team.",100rabhs,/Profile/100rabhs,India,50
kinnaur,"Chitkul is an ideal place for those who want to enjoy natural beauty without any crowd. Moreover, Zostel is excellent place to stay there, where you need not worry for any basic commodities like warm water, charging points, clean bedsheets and quilts, fresh and tasty veg and non veg food, etc. Above all that, Zostel provides additional facilities which will make you love that place like guitar, Guru (their pet dog), lunch and dinner in the open dining, trekking, and many other small things which will make your stay memorable.",Deepak G,/Profile/DeepakG1748,,50
kinnaur,"This is by far one of the most beautiful places to visit. The hostel is great, and the open cafe gives you a splendid 360 degree view of the entire valley. In the evenings they put on soothing lights and bonfire. If you are into stargazing, this would be a magical place for you to stay. They even organize hiking trails that gave us splendid views of the snowclad peaks and mindblowing sunset. Awesome experience.",Aviral G,/Profile/AviralG22,,50
kinnaur,The place is fine for once ! This place seems nice but is very different from other zostels !  It has a smoking zone ! Is offering tents along with bunker beds One of the owner is fine (local one) the other one is absurd ! Common area is not open to outsiders. The bonfire is paid. You can skip this if you value personal touch and hospitality. But if you are in a group you don't have to bother about anything .,Manav G,/Profile/Mrgloballylocal,"Mumbai, India",30
