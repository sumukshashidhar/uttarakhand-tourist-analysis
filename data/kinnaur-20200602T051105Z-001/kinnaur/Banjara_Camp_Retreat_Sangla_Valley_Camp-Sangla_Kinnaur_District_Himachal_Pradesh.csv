kinnaur,"While all Banjara Camps and Retreat properties where I stayed (Thanedar, Sojha, Sanougi and Langza) were great, this one was my favourite. Set amidst apple orchards and on the banks of Baspa stream, it is indeed a retreat. SA great place to leave the cobwebs of city life behind and enjoy the cleanest air of the country. There are so many activities to do here - go on day hikes in the surrounding snow-clad peaks or take a trip to Chitkul, the last village before Indo-Tibetan border. While I am not a big foodie, the food served here made me one. Simple, home-cooked food. the rooms very spacious and decorated in Indo-Tibetan style, reflecting the culture of the region. The Manager, Omprakash was really very caring and made sure we got everything we needed.  I highly recommend this",Travel See Write,/Profile/TravelSeeWrite_arch,"New Delhi, India",50
kinnaur,"The gush of the Baspa providing the aural backdrop with the chirping and beguiling calls of the myriad birds found here break the monotony of the river with welcoming frequency... the towering snowclad and deodhar and pine laden peaks on Banjara's North-south coordinates and the sweet smell of apples blossoms wafting through the crisp air, one needs to breathe deeply here... The sound, smells and sights are experience of pure bliss. With such a backdrop of the sublime and sometimes visceral, being in Sangla is heavenly encounter of a different kind. What adds and further hightens the interface with mother nature here is the Banjara retreat itself. The comfort, food and more importantly the experience of interacting with the staff who man Banjara so efficiently and flawlessly",RSK,/Profile/samkris1968,,50

Sangla offers very limited options for stay but even when compared to the stunning views of Raksham, Mastrang, Chitkul or Kalpa, Banjara camps wins hands down as a total package. Excellent meals are part of their package including the yummy packed lunches. They go out of the way to accommodate  odd hours of arrival and departure.

The morning brought alive a valley that was least expected - tall peaks on either side of this well-groomed lodge nesting inside an Apple Orchard, with stream gurgling nearby and crisp air welcoming all. It reminded us a lot of Zion National Park in the US, now with snow capped peaks and crisper air. We were here 4nts, and had a wonderful stay.  Activities - did 3 walks -  1.

Driving from Delhi, with a well-needed halt at the Banjara Orchard Retreat at Thanedar was just what the doctor ordered. The Camp has grown and a well-appointed main block building with double rooms now offer an experience suited for the less adventurous as well, in case you're wary of braving the cold in the tents. Warm tea and coffee and a zillion rounds of scrabble kept us warm in the main block, while treks to the Indo-Tibet border (Chitkul Village and Nagasthi, the last Indian outpost on the border); and over the glaciers to Batseri Village - one of the best governed in the country; kept us occupied through the stay.

We came in the middle of apple harvest season and could pick apples straight from the trees at the resort. Very nice. Our young son loved playing around the camp area - so many things for him to explore.  Since we had a small child and my not-so-young parents, we opted for the the new building since October gets very cold. The rooms in Banjara are comfortable and light - the use of wood gives a very nice look and feel to the place. Overall it's a very high standard considering the remoteness of this place.

Sangla retreat, in its Swiss Tents avatar, has been my annual pilgrimage since its inception. I could not resist the temptation to take a look at the new permanent building and get to stay there even at the start of winter when it is not the ideal time for travelling in these parts.
