kinnaur,"Location – The Camp is located in a valley about 7 kilometres from the small town of Sangla on the way to Chitkul which is the last village in India and further which lies Tibet. All through the journey on the winding road after Sangla to the Camp I was wondering that the camp will come into view on a plateau surrounded by mountains, when suddenly the driver stops the car on the road and reverses the car towards Sangla and then takes a steep road downhill that I realised that the Camp is on a steep cliff on the side of the mountain and further down in the river Baspa.    The Camp – The camp has only tented accommodation across the property on various levels. The kitchen is next to the entry/exit and then followed by the big dining area around which 28 tents are located on 3",Gautam_Rathor,/Profile/Gautam_Rathor,"White House, Jamaica",50

While the location is awesome with breathtaking views of the mighty Himalayas, what takes the cake is the people - Mr. Dileep is one of the best hosts I have come across and he has an equally warm team to take care of all needs of their guests.

They are little higher than the riverbed and a downhill walk with little effort can take one to the riverbed. The camps at the end are the best with beautiful valley view.

kinnaur,"It was wonderful experience. Its located next to the Baspa River and absolutely picturesque. One can spend hours just sitting there and gazing into the great view it affords with high mountains all around. This place has only tents but they are pretty comfortable and have all the facilities one can think of. The staff is good, well behaved and available at all times. They are accomodating and seem eager to ensure comfort to their guests. The food is great but the Indian dishes should require improvement. Its a great place for any kind of break.",saka420,/Profile/saka420,delhi,50
kinnaur,"i Must say this is one of the best locations i have been to for my vacations. I stayed for 3 nights on two occassions Very beautifully kept and equally fantastic people Pradeep, Dilip and Vijay. The camp gives you such a homely feeling that after a long drive all your tiredness disappears in a flash. They recently shifted to their new location Just about 100 mtrs from Baspa river is an amazing experience. The food is also amazing and all  available in plenty. All the travellers who make it to the hills once a year should make it a point to visit Kinner camps for a life time experience. One can go trekking, fishing and not to forget a beautiful place for photography the surroundings are amazing. Narayan",T. Narayan,/Profile/tnarayanphotography,"New Delhi, India",50
kinnaur,We stayed at Kinner camp for one day but felt it was to short a stay to know this wonderful place. Both Vijay and Dalip were extremely hospitable and a great company. The Italian food for dinner was just outstanding as was the continental breakfast next day morning. This is just the right rather a perfect place for a vacation. The 5 minute walk to river side and visit to Batseri village was lovely.   Thank you team kinner camp.,Asheesh S,/Profile/Asheesh1509,"Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, India",50
kinnaur,"I've been to this property twice. First time was about 8 years ago when it was located further up the river. It was a small and rustic campsite then with a lot of care taken to blend in with the surroundings.Now it has been shifted down river before Banjara Camps.  The new location is fantastic as it is about 100 mts from the river that you can hear all day even from the tents. The tents are a misnomer as they are trying to make them as close to rooms as possible with attached toilet / bathroom. This year there was no running water, but they are planning to install running hot water from next year onwards  What really stands out about this place is the location and great service. The service may vary at full occupancy, as this time we were the only tent in the camp and had",abhinavG,/Profile/abhinavG,"Bengaluru, India",40
kinnaur,"We booked this hotel directly through Negi's. Location, service is of exceptional quality.  Although tents are not real big size swiss tents, however it never disappoints you.  The tents are well maintained facing snow mountains.  A beautiful river is flowing 100 feets away from the tents which adds to the overall beauty.  We travelled from shimla to kinner, sangla,  Usual travel time will be around 7-9 hrs.  9 maximum considering almost 4 hrs of river/mountain side trial across the river.  Entire pass from rampur to sangla is magnificent. you hardly loose sight of snow mountians or rivers.  Remarkable experience  but truly tiring journey of 8+ hrs.",vishwasbansal,/Profile/vishwasbansal,indore,50
kinnaur,"Reached Kinner camps when it was already dark (around 7.30pm) and it was freezing. We were greeted by Mr Pradeep Negi (the owner) and his furry white pet.  We were given hot water to drink to warm ourselves a little and the bonfire was started. In a little while food arrived, which was the most scrumptious home made food we have ever had. It had everything from soup, salad to dal, roti, rice, sabzi and dessert. Simply wonderful. The tents were basic but confortable. There were thick duvets to keep us warm. The next morning was our first sight of the surrounding and we were stunned. The camp was in a valley surrouded by snow capped mountains. The foothills of the mountains were covered with green conifers. We could hear the Baspa river down below in the valley. The sun was",Niki,/Profile/himalayanodyssey,"Mumbai, India",50
