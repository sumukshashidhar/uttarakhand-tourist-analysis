kinnaur,"Just had a one night halt at Kalpa & was looking for a comfortable stay at a reasonable price. This place fit the bill perfectly. The hosts were extremely warm folks making sure our needs are well taken care of. We had to start early in the morning and the hosts made sure that our breakfast was ready.The food overall was pretty good. Last but not the least, this place comes with an excellent view of the Kailash Kinnaur mountain range so you can catch the sunrise here",Amit S,/Profile/amitstr,"Bengaluru, India",50

kinnaur,"Well Where to start from, Right from the word Kalpa, it is Amazing...  It has Unobstructed beautiful views from hotel of Kinner Kailash. The Whole experience is amazing all together. Great host, Great hospitality.   In rooms you also get 24 hours hot water facilites which is a good thing in this part of the world. Secondly a great plus point is you get an indoor car park which is also a boon in this area as roads are narrow and its not the safest to leave your cars just on the side of the narrow lanes.  Overall great place Kalpa and great hotel with great service.",Faliksha,/Profile/Faliksha,"New Delhi, India",40
kinnaur,"Kalpa is truly a serene place in Himachal Pradesh to visit. However, accommodation options are not as good as they should be. But, Hotel Destination Kalpa proves me wrong here. It is a fine hotel to stay during Kalpa tours. It is a small hotel, yet beautifully builds with all the world-class facilities and amenities. Hotel rooms are truly neat and clean and whatever I demand, I get it in my room immediately. Food is delicious, more especially the traditional dishes of Himachal Pradesh that truly keep me and my sweetheart spell-bound. Days were less; otherwise I was planning to stay a day or two more. After all, I give excellent rank to Hotel Destination Kalpa for providing me such amazing services and facilities.",Dheeraj1987,/Profile/Dheeraj1987,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",50
