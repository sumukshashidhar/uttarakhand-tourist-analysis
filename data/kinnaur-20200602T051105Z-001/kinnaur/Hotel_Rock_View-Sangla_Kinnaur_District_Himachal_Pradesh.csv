kinnaur,"Very nice rooms  tastefully decorated and you get an awesome view of the mountain ranges if you are staying in the rooms on the higher floors.However it is located about 2.5kms from the city centre and you can access it before you reach the proper city. As it is located next to apple orchards ,you can also feast your Eyes with views of apple laden trees in the gardens.",mausumee,/Profile/mausumee,"Kolkata, India",40
kinnaur,"FOOD: I have to start with this because of just how bad the food was. I am sitting here right now typing this while I plate of chicken chowmein that I ordered sits desolate because it stinks like garbage. The chicken is non-existent. The vegetables are all raw and the chowmein has been dowsed in some sauce that is reeking of something strangely acidic and sour at the same time.  Every Indian food is loaded with ginger, garlic and onion. It's like I was eating Onion Chicken and not chicken curry. Half of the food is raw. I do not know if this is because its easily available, but I have tasted better food at more remote places with the same ingredients.  The dal, however, was surprisingly very good. Try the potato bhaji. These were the only two redeeming things.   SERVICE/",Ishita Ghosh,/Profile/HillsGotEyes,,30

kinnaur,"The food  was  good. They make it according to your choice. Hotel staff very good, and accomodative .We travelled from Sarahan and reached the hotel at 3 pm. Stitl they gave us hot meal. The hotel was inside an apple orchard, so in the month of September it was a good sight to see apples all around the room thru through the windows. However, I would personally suggest people to stay at Rakcham rather than Sangla as it is much more picturesque.",debasrisaha,/Profile/debasrisaha,"Kolkata, India",50

kinnaur,"I had visited Sangla and stayed in this hotel in July 2016, we were three of us for a documentary shoot. Needless to say, the services of this hotel are so overwhelming and the Manager Mr Arjun himself takes care of each and everything you need or if everything is alright when you are in his hotel. It's rare to find such Hotel Manager or such a nice person. We used to return late to hotel after the shoot, but still we never heard a No for our dinner even the restaurant would be closed by then nor for any other service, they are always ready for your service.  Next time I'm in Sangla, I'd definitely stay in this hotel again.  Thanks",Sharad S,/Profile/SharadS314,,50

kinnaur,Very good location away from busy Sangla. On the main road leading to Chitkul. Mr Negi provided excellent service. Wonderful cook provided nice breakfast. Overall a nice small budget hotel. Our group of 20 enjoyed our short stay.  üëç,Chopra_Par,/Profile/Chopra_Par,"New Delhi, India",30
kinnaur,First of all...If you want to explore Sangla-Rakcham-Chitkul I strongly recommend to first try for hotels at Chitkul then Rakcham n if nothing is available then only look for hotel in Sangla.  Regarding Rock View Hotel...it is in Kupa village which is even before Sangla.  I would call it an extended Home Stay then a hotel. View from the terrace level rooms are nice....but since the hotel is surrounded by village you will get to also see village houses between you and d nice valley.  There is nothing in Kupa....no market for a tourist's interest...no valley to venture out in the evening or early morning.....river Baspa can't be accessed either.  Food is average....same menu every day.....and for breakfast they don't have anything beyond aloo paratha and tea.....Atleast they told,Gautam,/Profile/Gautam3080,"Vaishali, India",30
kinnaur,"This was an excellent choice of accommodation as we got the top floor with the terrace for a good view of the surrounding mountains. The owner was really generous and sweet and even got us local himachali cuisine do-rang-maar and Apple wine for us. The food served was delicious and we preferred to have all the meals in the hotel during our stay. Even though the temperature dipped to 1 degree Celsius during our stay, the room kept us warm and comfortable. The wooden interiors with the low bed and mattress added an aesthetic touch to the room.

kinnaur,"This hotel is delightful, the deluxe rooms on the top floor have nice wood paneling and a decent bathroom, 2 deluxe rooms open out on to a large top floor balcony with nice views. The home cooked meals are tasty and a generous sized serving, the owners are friendly and speak English, you cant go wrong here.     Sangla is a small village in the mountains of the Kinnaur Valley, an interesting  region of northern India, you can arrange your own tour from Shimla with a driver, travel the Hindustan highway to see the mountains, temples and Satluj river for a completely different Indian experience.",Steve9119,/Profile/Steve9119,"Riverton, Australia",40
kinnaur,"Best hospitality and best staff...I stayed there for 2 weeks almost. Hotel staff and especially owner Mr Arjun are very kind and friendly by nature. Hotel rooms are neat and clean with all basic facilities like lcd, geyser etc. Food options you'll get limited choice but staff will cook anything you want extra from menu or you can use hotel kitchen. In short everything is good about this hotel and it's staff, no negative feedback. Thank you",rahul k,/Profile/rahulk950,"New Delhi, India",50

kinnaur,I think this one is best place to stay near by Sangla & Chitkul. Rooms as well as services provided were best. V spent 12 nights in different places in Spiti & lahaul valley but this was best among all places. Accommodation as well as food was too good. ,Sharad P,/Profile/172sharadp,,50
