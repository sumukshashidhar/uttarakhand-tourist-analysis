kinnaur,"An entire apple orchard perched at the back and glorious snow capped Kinnaur Kailash range in front. Big, clean rooms  with all amenities and eager staff. Homely and tasty food served in abundance. Ample parking place too. But all these were secondary to the personal attention given to us by Sanjay ji. Stay here in Kalpa for the treat that he is.

kinnaur,"An excellent property at Kalpa. What stands out is the deep personal involvement of Sanjay Thakur, who runs the show. He goes to great lengths trying to make sure his guests are comfortable and gets what they want more often than not. Catering to the whims of guests at mountain locations are always a challenge, but Sanjay mostly makes it happen - with a smile. Wonderful personality, matching a lovely property, great location and ample parking. He took us to Roghi cliff proactively, helped book us a different hotel on our way back from Kaza (as his was fully booked) and spent lots of time giving us an insight into the local culture, history and current affairs. Hope to visit again someday and stay with the family in the 4 bed family room, with a balcony facing Kinner Kailash :))",Shuvojoy C,/Profile/shuvojoyc,"Kolkata, India",50

kinnaur,"I stayed at Kalpa on my way back from Spiti Valley. The hotel is 30 minutes drive from the main Rekong Peo market and situated atop a hill. Sorrounded by apple orchards, the hotel is a great location with nice clean and spacious rooms. We got the room with a balcony and the view of the hills which is why it was more expensive. The hotel staff is courteous and helpful. We had a slight problem with moths entering the room at night but they were happy to change it. Great place for a night or two.",Ankush Rawat,/Profile/rawankush,,40
kinnaur,"Stayed there during our vist to kalpa in December, 2018 from 9-11dec. The hotel is situated at a beautiful location in kalpa. The hotel staff are really good and above all they serve the fresh and delicious food. Couldn't expect such a delicious food in  hill station. we received snowfall on 10th dec. believe me during snowfall it looks heaven. Though the temperature was in minus but we really enjoyed a lot.

We stayed a large, spacious  4 bedded room which was clean, well maintained and accompanied with a big balcony. The bathroom was provided with 24 hour hot water.

kinnaur,Travel on October 2018 with family and stayed for one night. This hotel situated in a beautiful location views and surrounded by Apple garden.  Host Sanjay Thakur is also a nice person. We had a pleasant stay in that hotel. Seating in balcony or roof of the hotel will give you lots of pleasure.  The only drawback we found is the food price. Each and every food item in that hotel is overpriced like one glass milk cost Rs 70.00. We travel through the highest point in Himachal Pradesh but never find milk with such a high price.,cjit71,/Profile/cjit71,"Bengaluru, India",40

Rooms are newly constructed, although there are little problems in room, it still was comfortable. Best rooms are the ones with balcony. The view of Kinner Kailash from the roof is amazing. The sunrise and sunsets are mesmerizing. And the food is so delicious.  They take some time in delivery of food, that's coz they make everything fresh.

The ambience,the serenity and the scenic view  of Mount Kinnour Kailash, along with the gentle winds of the pines. and the apple trees in the ochard adjacent to the hotel provide imediate relief to the tired mind and body. What more can one ask further,  but be pleasantly surprised  by the service of the management, which is polite and courteous and always  responding to  please you. Lead by the energetic young proprietor Mr. Sanjay Thakur, a charmer, personally  supervises the comfort of each guest. I wish him all the success.

kinnaur,Our stay in Tab Exotic Kalpa was a joyous experience. The hotel has great rooms and marvellous view of the snow capped peaks. The hotel owner(Mr.Sanjay) was very warm and friendly and a very nice person.The food served to us had great taste too. Our stay felt very homely due to the behaviour and services of the hotel staff. A stay in this hotel once you are in Kalpa is highly recommended.,nandita c,/Profile/60nanditac,,50
kinnaur,"Greeted by Namaste from Mr. Sanjay and the experience follows. Actually it started even before, since we started interaction on our stay. Service is their motto and they make the experience -A Great stay. Nice location, Great rooms and surrounding views along with the clear view of Kinnaur Kailash is the compelling reason. Oh yes! Do not miss the sunrise and sunset. They have a small apple orchard also. The staffs are ready with service. The experience would be incomplete without mentioning the food cooked by Subhash - My suggestion is  not to miss his cooking of Local Mutton. Three days spent like dream and thanks to Tab Exotic to make it happen.",ARNABCH,/Profile/ARNABCH,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50

kinnaur,"Happened to stay here in late Sep while on our way to Spiti and Ladakh. We were a group of 6 people in one XUV and two bikes. Location is good and we were welcomed by flowers and apple orchads. Renovation work was going on on the 1st floor and we werent aware of it which also meant the pool room wasn't open to guests as it was full of things. Food was made fresh and taste was great. Rooms are good in size and decent in comfort. Overall, once the furnishing is complete and all rooms set, this will be a worthwhile place to stay in Kalpa.

kinnaur,The guest house boss - Sanjay Thakur - was one of the most gracious hosts I've come across. He made sure that all our smallest of requests or needs were attended to. They arranged a pick up for us at 330 am and even provided us with a fantastic hot meal freshly made upon our request at an unearthly hour (4am). Tab Exotic has the best cook hands down - Pandit Ji. The guest house boy who basically manages day to day work -  Neetu - was supremely polite and nice. Every meal was to die for. Wonderful view from the rooms. The rooms are large and well lit. Tab Exotic is still getting built up and a first floor is under construction which should be completed in a couple of months. I totally recommend staying here if you are going to Kalpa.

The service, staff and the room furnishing is just perfect. The location is so scenic that it will blow your mind. We decided to spend one more day here instead of just one night so we could go on a short trek in the mountains behind this hotel. Sanjay Thakur, the owner even packed a bag of golden apples for us to enjoy on the trek. Since we had been away from Mumbai for a while and were craving for some street food, the cook even agreed to let us show him how to make the much revered vada pav.
