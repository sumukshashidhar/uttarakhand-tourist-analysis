kinnaur,"Located on outskirts of sangla, this camp is maintained beautifully but is over-priced and management charges for everything (even a cup of tea..:P). Offers beautiful view of  mountains but not of valley. Better camps around river are there few kms further at Rakcham. Staff was friendly and cooperative. Management is otherwise.

kinnaur,"We stayes in this camp in June 2018 and the experience was great. We were not expecting much at this altitude and the stay being in camp, but to our surprise, it was super experience. The chicken they made in the dinner was so so good, that whatever I write about it will be less. They also provided with hot water in the morning. Needless to say, the view from here is magistic.",1HungryGhost,/Profile/1HungryGhost,"Noida, India",40

kinnaur,"We booked this place with high hopes only to be terribly disappointed. The camp site is too small and is cramped with tents all around you.   I've been to many camps, this would rank lowest on my experience.   Tents are new but not the luxury Swiss tents I know and the attached bathroom was ultra basic.  Understaffed, owner seems to be running the show remotely from Delhi and has no passion for customer care.  Lastly, pick this place only if you have no other option (I wish I had gone for Banjara camps Sangla even though it's twice as expensive). ",Arunesh_Shukla,/Profile/Arunesh_Shukla,"Noida, India",10

While driving through we saw the camp and liked the location and the feel of the camp , the manager was helpful to show us around and we were excited to stay for a night in the tents..  The linen was dirty and on -request they were changed. Dinner and Breakfast were part of the deal .. Post the walk and enjoying the chai and snacks in the local market we headed back to the camp to enjoy the place ..  It was cold hence we requested for bonfire we told there is no wood ( though we saw a whole bundle of it) .

kinnaur,"Igloo Nature Camp located at Sangla Himachal Pradesh is one of the most ideal destination for Travellers who love Nature . The advantage of location is beneath Nature guarded by parts of Kinnaur Kailash Range , Sangla Kandla Range , and some other peaks around . Take some fresh air staying at Igloo Camp is main attraction with excellent service from camp admin.

kinnaur,With low on hope i started my trip as it was almost end of season to visit this place and it was my first solo trip. I had only a thing in mind that was to take a break from delhi pollution. And hell yes it helped. A place this peaceful is bliss. I have travelled almost everywhere in Himachal this being my latest and i can say sangla or Golden valley was majestic. And i would give Igloo Nature camp alot of credit for the same. Camp management helped discover explore this lonely planet in even more beautiful way. Tapan Dada the owner asked me to accompany him to Kanda and i thank him for that one of the best experience possible. Management of the camp was good evening with bonfire and trout fish was awesome.

The service of the staffs are also so bad that there are almost no basic amenities to stay with family. There are no proper resturant, a makeshift one is there which only provides dal, roti and rice that too upon repeated requests as they even does not have money to go to market to provide the fooding.

kinnaur,"Caveat: Sangla isn't completely in the boonies. There are a handful of hotels and homestays here. So you don't have to stay in a camp unless you want the experience.   Pros: 1) The camp has everything you can expect in a tented accommodation - attached flush toilets, power outlets, carpeted floors, bottled water etc. 2) The bed is quite comfortable so are the warm blankets that they supply. 3) Food was delicious and was available per our timings. Just make sure you pre-order the meals in advance. 4) The staff was very courteous and helpful. 5) The view from the camp was quite good. 6) Tariff was quite reasonable 7) Tents and the toilets were reasonably clean.  Cons: 1) Given that it is a campsite, it does get quite cold at nights. 2) It is away from town and you need a vehicle",rmanoj,/Profile/rmanoj,"Pune, India",40

kinnaur,"I can understand the last two reviews. The visitors probably expected well manicured gardens, five star room service and well dressed waiters. Sorry, camping amongst nature in the wild is so different from luxury resorts and spas ... a place for nature camping  should be as natural as it could be, use local people even if they can only smile and offer basic amenities which, we got at this place. The surroundings never made us miss the TV sets, the smiling faces of the locals living in this harsh terrain, the crisp water from the waterfalls, the hot soups and food and the wild apricot flowers all made up for a great memory.

The hygiene of the bed, linens etc. could be better compared to what they charge. Food was hygienic but quality can be improved. Staffs were innocent, hardworking and helpful. Igloo management could maintain the camp and garden better. The camp area is limited, within that they have a place for bonfire.  Though the booking was done for 3 days, there was nothing much to do after the second day so we headed towards Shimla.

River Baspa flows just the apple orchard adjoining to the resort. Snow views at sunset and moonlit night is breathtaking. The tented accommodation is superb. Only the attached bath should be better.

The staff there are excellent and more than willing to help you on any request. Food is great (we are bengali and they had a bengali cook there) with wide choices (though availability might be an issue as the location is remote).  I strongly recommend this place for homely service and most importantly excellent location. Suggestion for improvement - Landscaping within the property could be better and running hot water from tap would be preferred (now it is a guy running with bucket of hot water to your tent on request). And we were 3 family there with another tent occupied (they have total of 10 tents) - in full occupancy it might feel crowded.,ShantanuChatterjee,/Profile/ShantanuChatterjee,"Greater London, United Kingdom",50

The approach roads are bad, the worst 30 kms in a 300 kms radius.  The hydro-electrical projects in the area have added to the government's obvious apathy to nature conservation or development.  One has to be determined to travel these miles or know what lies at the other end.      The scene changes the moment you approach the Sangla Village.

The toilet was freshly painted so we had to be careful not to touch the walls etc. but it was good. The tent itself was pretty basic but the bed was comfortable.  We had dinner in another tent where they had a TV running. Dinner was also pretty basic but anything at that hour and place seemed reasonable. In the morning, the view from the camp is very nice.

Interesting part of this venue is they organise adverture short trip and activities like trekking to Sangla Kanda, rope travarsing of Baspa river, rock climbing etc. Food is also good, fresh and delicious, but  one should not expect exotic food at that altitude.
