kinnaur,"When we planned for our trip to Kinnaur (Kalpa- Sangla-Chitkul) I really did not know what to expect. heard a lot about this place and so it was in my bucket list. but I was not prepared for the landscape and view that unfolded in front of us as we crossed the gate to Kinnaur- that is sarahan to be precise. This kind of landscape with rugged yet grass green mountain, ""sky blue"" skies with generous offering of white clouds, deep dark canyons with mountain rivers running through it like a child happily going home after school made us speechless and we tried to devour this health diet to cleanse our toxic city minds as much as we could. I planned the trip myself and during the last phase of the journey was our 2 nights stay at Sangla, the most remote part of the journey.we planned",Biswajit Ghosh,/Profile/bg_kol,"Kolkata, India",50
kinnaur,Stayed here for a day. It's in the valley of Baspa river. The view from the hotel was excellent. The hospitality of the hotel was unparalleled. The owner and staffs were very friendly. They even provide us an extra room instead of providing two extra beds. They got a nice dining area. The food was also very good. The rooms were well maintained. Sheets and blankets were cleaned and unused. The rooms are equipped with Bluetooth speakers. We totally enjoyed the stay.,Chinmayan,/Profile/chinnayanp,"Trivandrum, India",50

kinnaur,"I had been there recently during my nature camp. The hotel is within the Batseri village. Rooms are pretty nice, clean, spacious and nicely decorated. Food is awesome too. We had really good time here. If you want to spend couple of days within a calmly place, then this is a very good option. Recommend to take small vehicles/SUVs as the road to the village is narrow.",gaurigurav,/Profile/gaurigurav,"Mumbai, India",50

kinnaur,"Thanks to host of hotel Uttarayan Mr. Jay Negiji for his hospitality. Actually we arrived late at night around 10 pm. But he was there to greet us. Served delicious food. You have snow covered mountain all around. Can hear only beautiful sound of running water from river very close to hotel. Rooms are neat and clean, warm also. Memorable and peaceful stay at this beautiful basteri village. Little bit long from main road but Must stay here instead of crowded Sangla. I'll sure stay there again.",Ratnesh D,/Profile/RatneshD11,,50
kinnaur,"A hotel worth staying in while in (Batseri) sangla valley. From their warm smiling welcome to their sweet goodbyes, they made our stay pleasant and homely. Comfortable and cozy rooms, excellent room service and extremely delicious food which is freshly cooked on order... During our three days stay in Sangla, we had the best food in here, just like any Punjabi would like.  They are a perfect example of excellent hospitality...!",Divya M,/Profile/DivyaM639,,50
