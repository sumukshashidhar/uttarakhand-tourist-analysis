kinnaur,"Best part is the location of Resort, its just next to Baspa River and the last resort on the road. You can enjoy full view of snow capped mountains and river passing through them. Take your vehicle and go down to Baspa River and just relax there and enjoy best of nature. Resort is decently built and is one of the best resort in small tiny town. what i missed was the cleanliness of the resort, but looking at the toughest of terrains and location of resort we can discount on that part. Apart from that staff was highly helpful and supportive. Food was good and lot of options were available. Still looking at the village, you tend to enjoy nature at fullest and will surely don't mind the smallest of things. Again the view is exceptional and one will love to visit this place again and",Shashank7979,/Profile/Shashank7979,"New Delhi, India",40
kinnaur,One of the most well maintained resorts that i have ever visited. The ambiance of the resort was quite remarkable. Every single penny of mine was worth staying there.The hospitality that was shown by the resort staff was appreciable.

kinnaur,"I must say, till date, Samaa Resort is the best place to stay in Chitkul Village. It has the best view as it is the last hotel on the road and you get a clear view of snow capped mountains without any obstacle. We booked Voyage room which has full view of mountains. Rooms are really beautiful, cozy and cute, a perfect type of room you would want at a high altitude cold place like Chitkul. Staff is really helpful, friendly, cooperative, and fast. You can get many delicious food items in the kitchen, which you don't expect at such place. The owners and the manager are really jolly guys and try their best to make your stay comfortable and memorable. They would guide you about the place and help you in planning your day.

I spoke to Manmeet, Hotel owner, over call and reached to Hotel around 6 PM and they had 1 room vacant for us.  Manmeet is simply awesome, and their friendly nature makes your stay at this property really awesome. He offered his cell phone to call us at our Home as in Chitkul, only BSNL network is working.  Location of the hotel is really awesome, though Chitkul is small village and it is centrally located from all tourist points. Baspa River is just 500 mtrs away, Chitkul Mata Temple is just 200 Meters away....

One of our friend Mr. Amit had a B'dy on 29th August & it was an extreme surprise to see Mr. Manmeet with all his staff standing at our door with home prepared/baked cake. It doesn't matter that cake was big or small or chocolate or red velvet, it was prepared with love & compassion. This gesture of hosts left us speechless.

We watched the sun rise from the room, and I could take pictures of the milky way from the balcony in the night. Saying this, the inside of the room was not too great. it was okay-ish. There was no electricity for the entire duration, barring a few hours in a portion of the hotel, and we were surely staying in that portion. They blamed the electric company, but I highly doubt it. There was some loud banging in the form of construction work going on in the room exactly above us upto 10 pm, and you can imagine how much noise it make in the wooden building, and I had to request thrice before they finally stopped.

Be rest assured that being here at our age (I am a senior citizen) will cause breathing trouble, if not taken care of movements especially while using staircase.  It was minus 2 degree while we reached this hotel. Initially it was bit tough for us to cope with.

kinnaur,"I stayed in Chitkul Sanaa resorts for two nights with family. Firstly Chitkul is pretty remote so some leeway is in order. This resort was previously called Panchali hotel and is staffed by Mr Jaswinder (probably the only worthwhile person) and 3 other boys. When I reached, i saw it was getting renovated, the first thing that struck me was the smell of cooking gas. The room was dirty, there was hair from previous occupants in the bathroom. A basket with some toiletries was partially used already. I pointed this out to Jaswinder who got the room and bathroom cleaned. Other than that Mr Jaswinder ensured that we were served as well as possible under circumstances. The food was below par. The bread we were served had fungus on it. It was pretty obvious and I don't know how it was",Shubhmohan,/Profile/Shubhmohan,,30

Near Karcham just called up Mr. Manmeet ( owner) Samaa Resorts Chitkul.... It was a small conversation only on phone didn't got to meet him but he gave us a feeling like come over we are waiting here for you like one gets feeling of going home and family waiting.... Driving whole day....exhausting trip and we were welcomed by Mr Jaswinder ( ex ITBP personal) a very humble and polite gentleman.... He really took care of things and guided well.... Food was very well home cooked.... Rooms were clean.... Location is superb... It's last hotel in last inhibited village on old Indo- Tibetan trade route..... Breath taking views.....

After a long, tiring journey to this beautiful village, I was warmly welcomed into this resort by smiling faces and a comfortable room! Samaa Resorts is located at the end of the village which offers unhindered, panoramic view of the majestic mountains!  Being a solo traveler, I found excellent company in Manali and Manmeet and few of their guests. Its just the kind of place where you will bump into like minded fellow travellers with the same love for the mountains and adventure!

Rakcham, abt 10 kms before chitkul is a natures marvel. Especially the glacier where one can easily walk upto is not to be missed.  We stayed at samaa resorts n the hospitality, food n view from the spacious rooms added onto the excitement. The staff is very warm. the welcoming nature of the owners (Manmeet Singh n Manali Kaur) is what comforts you like your own home n makes you want to extend your stay for a few more days.  Being a traveler for years now, samaa resorts n chitkul is a combination not to be missed upon. Will surely visit again.  Highly recommended for couples n families. ",Wasim L,/Profile/311wasiml,,50

A small place but full of sceneic beauty and lots of adventure on the way.The best part of being in chitkul was Sasmaa Resorts.While visiting such places we always think about where we will stay and  what to eat, but the owners of samma resorts Manmeet and Manali took very good care of us.The outside view from the hotel is so amazing that you would like to stay in resort for hours.Each room is very well decorated and clean & neat, which is hard to find in such a remote place.

Hence we were quite surprised to see various civil work going on inside and outside which did not give a comfortable feel with cement dust etc all over the passage etc. However the kitchen team is a set of young boys - very enthusiastic and endeavouring to do their best under the circumstances. However management should provide the required support for delivery which was lacking. For example: Pulav is there on the menu , but we got it all soggy as it was made out of normal rice and not basmati rice.  Explanation gvien was that the same was not being stocked.

This is a place where one will want to visit again for the divine view it provides and more so for the fine hospitality its owners and staff ensure to make you comfortable.

Even though there are other hotels in the area,Samaa is one of the few hotels that can be found online while searching for Chitkul.. The owners Manmeet & Manali also have a property in Kalpa and are in the process of opening the same in Narkanda as well..

kinnaur,I visited chitkul with my family. It's a super beautiful place. The beauty of this place can not be explained to someone who has not been here. The yardstick is totally different you can't explain people who have just been to Shimla/mussourie how beautiful places like sangla/chitkul are. I stayed at Samaa Resorts and was immediately stuck by the passion and enthusiasm of the owner couple who were both themselves avid Bikers and had left their comfortable Bombay lives to pursue their passion in the mountains. They were very kind and generous and kept our kids entertained with a lot of stories and made sure that our stay was comfortable. The LOCATION of the resort is the USP.

With an unobstructed view of the mountains, Samaa unarguably the best view you can get in any of the resorts. The owners were there at the same time as us.

A major plus point of the hotel is the food. After a long time on the road you crave for good food. Their pasta and sizzlers can put many Bombay restaurants to shame. The stay is extremely comfortable with really well informed staff. And finally the owners Manali and Manmeet are just the right people you want to meet on your travels.
