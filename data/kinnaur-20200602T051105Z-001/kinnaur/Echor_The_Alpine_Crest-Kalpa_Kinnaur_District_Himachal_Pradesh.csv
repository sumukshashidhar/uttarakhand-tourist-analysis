kinnaur,"We stayed here in Feb. A beautiful property in a very peaceful part of the village in midst of Apple orchard. We had the family room which was ideal for our family of four. The bed were comfortable. The room was very spacious with beautiful view. The bathroom was also clean and had everything required for a comfortable stay. Staff Kaku and pawan  were great and gave us lots of useful information about the area, local attractions and treks etc.  Breakfast was served on open terrace (giving stunning view of snow clad Kinner kailash range ) and was absolutely delicious!. We stayed for 3 nights. A short, easy walk to the Kalpa fort  and Suicide point. Kalpa bus stop was very close to the property.  we found that staying in the more peaceful area significantly enhanced our stay. We",Geetika,/Profile/Geetik4321,,40

kinnaur,"Nice evening walk in the apple orchard. nice hanging out on the terrace after dinner, sat together after a long time with kids outside on terrace exploring moon through their telescope. Kind staff and they nicely served us with customized food for our child. I will recommend this hotel. In kalpa we stayed for two days they have perfect location to enjoy sunset and sunrise and really good view of fort from the property,",richa,/Profile/richawe123,,50
kinnaur,"Stayed for 3 days and overwhelmed by the ccourtesy of this place. The food was amazing the wooden rooms are just awesome. Each room has great views and surrounded by apple orchards . The hospitality of this place was quite nice. Walkable from temple and still isolated from other hotels in Kalpa since it is surrounded by Apple orchard trees, wild apricot trees and even there were some purple plumb trees that I tried and saw for the first time in my life. I would recommend to stay here. Must visit Padam palace enroute to Kalpa in Rampur.",Pargat,/Profile/Par9singh,,50
kinnaur,"Me and my friends stayed their on our way to Kaza. We booked it bcz of its open terrace. We spent that night drinking wine and staring at beautiful moon and stars that we used to miss in our Delhi. Terrace was privately booked by us as we had all 3  rooms booked available on that floor so giving us sense of privacy for our party and openness to the sky and mountains. Enjoyed our stay. Amazing hospitality, staff served till late to us. Good vibes, nice location.",Pandey,/Profile/Abhipandey12,"Noida, India",50
kinnaur,Lovely place in the midst of Apple orchard. Nice wooden architecture on main gate itself. Kinner kailash and fort both are visible from Window and balcony. Rooms are spacious with wooden interior. Location was good and separated from other hotels in Kalpa.  Kamal really took care of us from serving early morning tea to guiding us for nature walk to their Apple orchard. Enjoyed our stay and also recommend to others looking for good hotel with best view in Kalpa !!,S Natrajan,/Profile/RajanGSK,,50
