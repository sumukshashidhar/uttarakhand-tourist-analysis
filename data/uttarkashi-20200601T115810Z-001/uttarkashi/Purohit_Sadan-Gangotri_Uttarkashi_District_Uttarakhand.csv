uttarkashi,"I loved this place only because of the location . The rooms are small and so are the bathrooms . There was almost no amenties both in room and Bathroom . They couldn't t even arrange morning tea for us . Service was dissapointing , Im aware that Gangotri is a small town and at such a great height but even basic facilities were lacking here . The only about this place best was The view & the location .",Cindy A,/Profile/CindyA2224,,30
uttarkashi,"We group of 3 adults stayed at Purohit Sadan for 1 night in July 2016. The experience was satisfactory, considering the overall facilities in the town. The best thing is location, very close to Gangotri Temple, and on the other side, roaring river Bhagirathi. We enjoyed sitting in the balcony, right over the flow of Bhagirathi. One can hear sound of bells and aarti from the temple. Also, it is very much on the main road, so one can have good eating facilities nearby.  One usually does not expect hi-fi facilities in Gangotri as most of the tourists would stay at Harsil or Uttarkashi rather than in Gangotri. Gangotri is a very small town with guest houses with basic facilities. For basic accommodation and for service, I would like to recommend Purohit Sadan.",Parin P,/Profile/drparin,"Rajkot District, India",40
uttarkashi,"This is a brand new property, located a few steps away from the Gangotri temple and right on the bank of the river next to the bathing ghats. It's right on the one street in town - the one that leads to the temple. So getting to the temple and away doesn't get easier - in fact you can keep checking whether the queues are getting shorter, and you won't feel like it was even a minor inconvenience. The open terrace in front of the rooms is great to hang out on - you can laze around and watch the sun's last rays reflecting off Mt. Sudarshan - or just pass time looking at pilgrim activities at the ghats. The rooms are newly constructed - so they're pretty neat (though small and basic); the bathrooms are newly-appointed in the western-style and quite clean. It's a pity they don't",arigho57,/Profile/arigho57,"Hyderabad, India",40
