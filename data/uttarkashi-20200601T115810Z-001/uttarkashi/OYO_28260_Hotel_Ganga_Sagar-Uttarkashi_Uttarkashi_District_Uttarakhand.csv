uttarkashi,Donâ€™t believe any thing about this hotel that is written in OYO or Goibibo as it is full of lies. It is a hotel used by large travel groups of travel agents just to make their pilgrims rest overnight.it has very basic facilities and the bathroom stinks.They have no captive power.The free breakfast in their dictionary is two pieces of bread and if you argue they will skip that too. They have a couple of rooms whose balcony has direct view of river Bhagirathi . It has no restaurant and two dirtily clad room boys double up as managers too. Our effort to get better service through OYO and Goibibo did not yield any result. All in all a very bad experience. Try to get rooms in hotels in Natalia area of Uttarkashi if you want to stay there.,giri1951,/Profile/giri1951,"Bengaluru, India",10
