uttarkashi,"This property needs severe attention in terms of management and maintenance. The staff here is like a disease which will not let this property survive. There's no concept of service. Poor quality linen, stained towels, stale food, pathetic housekeeping summarise my stay here.  You would find most of the staff roaming around with their fingers up their mouth trying to spit out tobacco or up their nose. They consider hygiene overrated :).  The hotel run restaurant is managed by extremely arrogant folks who never hesitate to charge you for food you did not eat. Yes, please check and double check you bills before paying. GMVN should strongly consider changing all of their staff here to improve their services.",TIng C,/Profile/TIngC497,,10

uttarkashi,"TRH Uttarkashi is now known as Bhagirathi Tourist Complex. But not just the name, property itself as added a lot of glitter to it- glitter in terms of comfort and facilities. Although you would have wished that the interiors could have been done in more ethnic way but nevertheless it has got more comfort than you can expect from a government property. Staff is good natured and helpful, food was very good. They were courteous enough to provide us a warm and fresh food when we were very late to reach past midnight due to landslides on the way. Uttarkashi is important use for chardham yatris going to Gangotri or Yamunotri. This property mainly targets those tourists. Rooms were big and spacious with separate sitting area.",Upendra Swami,/Profile/swamiupendra,"New Delhi, India",40

uttarkashi,Visited Gmvnl Uttar Kashi tourist rest house on 1st June 2018 with family. Location of the rest house is excellent as it is located just on the banks of river Bhagirathi.

uttarkashi,"We stayed in TRH Uttarkashi for a night and were treated to horrible service. Neither the restaurant nor the 24 hour Room service was available at 4 PM. The menu was extensive, but most of the dishes were not available. The manager of the kitchen/restaurant was extremely arrogant and cunning. Some of the staff is nice, but some is tired, arrogant and dismissive.  The hotel rooms were good and clean. The bathrooms were clean and had hot water.",Amitabh K,/Profile/amitabhk2018,"Pune, India",20

uttarkashi,"I stayed in this property on the way to Gangotri.The deluxe room is ok in size but maintenance leaves much to be desired. The disturbance by DJ party,organized in the hotel premises is another major drawback. I experienced same ordeal in KMVN TRH as well. There is no view,worth the name from the hotel. The location is,however, good with the Viswanath Temple situated in walkable distance.Staff are courteous. Food is average.",ddebabrata2016,/Profile/ddebabrata2016,"Ghaziabad, India",30
uttarkashi,"As with all GMVN properties, this one has very friendly staff. Even though our stay was not free of problems - there was no electricity and no water for some time - these problems were resolved and the manager and front desk staff were very apologetic. They explained why there was were these issues and they did their best to take care of us. The rooms were beautiful and clean, but just with a hint of disrepair. Maintenance is not quite the strong suit of these rest houses. However, the behaviour and the service is beyond complain. The Manager personally helped us regarding issues that had nothing to do with the stay at Uttarkashi. He is one of the most friendly men that I have come across in my travels. The food was good and the stay was comfortable. There was at least one",Siddhartha Biswas,/Profile/Siddharthabiswas,"Kolkata, India",40
uttarkashi,The GMVN TRH is a very comfortable place to stay en route from Rishikesh to Gangotri or north. We have been staying in this place since a long time but recently the  Government of UK has renovated some of the rooms and made them very luxurious.   It has a definite advantage of being right next to the Rishikesh - Gangotri highway route and also its proximity to the Kashi-Vishwanath temple which is just a 7-10 minute walk from the transit rest house a big advantage.  This has a very good restaurant and the menu is basic and good. Special mention to the honesty of the staff as forgotten personal belongings are returned after check-out by giving a call and reminding the owner.   One of the best places to stay and break journey or also an excellent place to stay while in Uttarkashi.,Harshawardhan,/Profile/Harshawardhan,"Nagpur, India",30

uttarkashi,We stayed at TRH Uttrkashi for one night on 16th September 2016 during our chardham yatra.Uttarkashi is a big city and lots of alternative accommodation may be available.we got this as a part of the travel package.this is a large setup.rooms and linen are clean and good.most of the rooms are old fashioned like mosaic tiles and white ceramic tiles in bath rooms.they are now renovating with modern vertified tiles.parking and open space to sit are  available inside the compound.food quality is also ok. the famous kashi viswanath temple of uttarkashi is 10 minutes walking distance from this rest house.all the market and activity areas are near the temple..the river bhagirathi is visible from the room.,sasinpc,/Profile/sasinpc,"Mumbai, India",40
uttarkashi,"In the small Uttarkashi town you can expect major choices available due to tourist dependent economy.   But this place is major connection point for two out of four dhams so in seasonal six months its buzzing with peoples. But there isn't any standardized stay option available than TRH.  This hotel is situated near main market, taxi point and bus depot so location wise its a wise choice.  Room and bathroom condition seems very old and in dire need for restoration.  Size of rooms and condition of bed and linen are okayish.  They have got attached restaurant which serves vegetarian fare only. Breakfast and snacks options are yummy sadly same is not applicable to Lunch and dinner options they are just okay.  Staff is friendly but services are bit lame.  Tariffs are surprisingly",Manandani,/Profile/Manandani,"Mumbai, India",40
