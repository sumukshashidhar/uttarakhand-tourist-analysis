uttarkashi,"this is one of the best homestays we had. Verygood owners and a good home. They also had farming of many fruits, uncle was very generous. And Aunty had really good hand in the kitchen. What lovely food we had that night. A typical village home (but a big one) and what a morning view from the balcony.  I can not forget that experience. Advice - Reach by 3-4pm. Enjoy the local area , sleep early, get up early - 6am. Enjoy farming and the megistical view. ",tusharkhandelwal,/Profile/tusharkhandelwal,"New Delhi, India",40
