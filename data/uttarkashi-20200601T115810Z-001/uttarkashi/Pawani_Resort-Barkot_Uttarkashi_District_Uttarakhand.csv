uttarkashi,"I can it is a worst hotel or resort. TV is there but doesn't work, phone is there saying intercom but no connectivity. Bed covers, pillow covers were dirty and unchanged. Not safe as well. It claims as 3 star in MakeMyTrip and cleartrip but it doesn't even deserve single star. Avoid going here",NashKnock,/Profile/NashKnock,,10
