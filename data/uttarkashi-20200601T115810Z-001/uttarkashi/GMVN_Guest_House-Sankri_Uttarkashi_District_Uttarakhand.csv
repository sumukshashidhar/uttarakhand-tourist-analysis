uttarkashi,"The caretakers were sleeping with a hangover throughout the day and just opened the door after we knocked for several minutes. The rooms were untidy and the toilet was in a horrible state. NOT EVEN FLUSHED. Upon complaint, they said ""they'll get it fixed"" and went back to sleep in their own room.  Don't be fooled by the name, while the property is still owned by GMVN, the locals told me that it has been given to a private Dehradun company, 'Himalayan Ambition' under a tender.   The caretaker refused to refund and we vacated the place within 30 minutes due to hygiene reasons. It is better to suffer a loss of money than ruin one's health and experience.  You can find many better options to stay in Sankari. Swargarohini Hotel was good, there are other homestay and small",Kartikeya K,/Profile/496kartikeyak,"New Delhi, India",10
uttarkashi,"Best avoided, esp when it rains as the rooms start seeping and the beds stink. There is no water facility and electricity. Please avoid this place if you are with kids. The town is big and has better hotels.",uday s,/Profile/286udays,"Bengaluru, India",20
uttarkashi,"The Guest house is situated above the valley and has a superb view. However be careful when it rains as the rooms on the top floor start leaking.   The guest house is in a bad state and they have a new management who has just taken over n the last month and they are working to make this place better.  There is no electricity and hence no hot water. Water has to be taken from Tanks in each floor.  They have a cook who makes decent food, but you will have more options if you walk down to the market area. Good place to stay at a very economical rate which is about INR 200 per person. This is the starting point for a lot of treks like Har ki Dhun ad Kedar Kanta.",Saurav Roy,/Profile/Moksh0241,"Shillong, India",30
uttarkashi,"The property is quite old but maintained pretty well, clean rooms and toilets, though rooms are not very much furnished but clean enough, food served was excellent, staffs very cooperating, 100 meters on the left from this TRH there is a junction from where one can view huge Mt.Banderpunch...market is also nearby to this property...",Anirban,/Profile/Anirban0302,"Kolkata, India",40
uttarkashi,"The guest house offers both dorms as well as private rooms. It commands the best views from all of Sankri. The caretaker/attendant is responsive, helpful and HONEST. I wish I remembered his name. The rooms are very basic, beds, and attached bathroom. Some built-ins for stowing away backpacks. Candles and matchsticks are provided as electricity is very sporadic. No onsite generator available. No hot water either. Running water is available though for the bathroom. This is the last time you will have running water before you head onwards for the Har Ki Doon trek. The caretaker took our dinner orders and brought up the food to the common area served us dinner (in candle light of course, no electricity). I would like to bring up the honesty point again though.
