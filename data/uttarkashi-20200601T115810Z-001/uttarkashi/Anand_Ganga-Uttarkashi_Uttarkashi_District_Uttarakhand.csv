You can sit on the balcony watching the river flow. High foresty mountains in the background and butterflies and birds fly around you.  Krishna the owner is the most welcoming host. He kept making sure all our needs are being taken care off. His English is great so it is very easy to communicate with him. He has alot of knolidge and he is happy to share it. The rooms are very homey,comfortable and clean. Lots of beautiful hikes all around. Highly recommended!",Nurit,/Profile/NuritP16,,50
uttarkashi,"I stayed here after trekking in the Himalayas.  The place was a perfect respite and Krishna a beautiful and kind host.  The location is off the main road and directly on the river so it is peaceful and quiet. There are lanais on all levels where you can sit and enjoy the view of the gardens, river and mountains. Food and drink served in the dining room is fresh and sattvic (healthy and made with care).  This would be a great place to have a yoga retreat given the physical location (mountains, river) and a relatively large room for groups to practice.  It is away from the main town of Uttarkashi but easy enough to get to.
