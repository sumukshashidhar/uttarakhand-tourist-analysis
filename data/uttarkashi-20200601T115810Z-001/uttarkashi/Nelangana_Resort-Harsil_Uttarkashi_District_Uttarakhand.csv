uttarkashi,"There are few places in this world where experience surpasses its maximum barrier, and the place isn't the only factor for this. Its the people. Often beautiful places belong to beautiful hearts, and here there are three Sameer, Shiraz, Suhail. This place is exceptionally beautiful and the staff adds up the charm. Sumptuous food, unforgettable hospitality; I have had an amazing time here and ganga maiya gave me my three long lost brothers. I have, without a doubt, found my second home. Highly recommended.",Gaurav Gairola,/Profile/Gauravgairola0885,,50
uttarkashi,"The place has a lot going on for it. The location is breathtaking, the rooms and clean and cozy, there's good complementary breakfast and dinner, and there's kali, who's nonchalance would win your heart! The hosts are helpful and welcoming. Wake up early morning, take a walk along one half of ganga and watch the golden sun light up the mountains around the valley. Harsil town itself is around 2 kms from this place. ",Shrey M,/Profile/shreym2015,"Bengaluru, India",50
uttarkashi,"We stayed for in Nelangana for three nights (dinner and breakfast included) in June-2019. The location is good on the bank of river and is okay for a short vacation. However, this hotel is overpriced and the service is terrible. There was a frequent power cut, and we stayed at room in dark many times. Bathrooms were dirty. We killed one scorpion and a big spider inside of the room, and this was very scary and we couldn't sleep last night. I also recommend not to order lunch without knowing the price; otherwise, they will charge a lot and cheat. They even charged extra for a glass of milk for my two years old daughter. They charge Rs 30 for a one-litre mineral water bottle. I would NEVER recommend this hotel unless you are extravagant.",Kuntal Manna,/Profile/kuntalmanna,,10
uttarkashi,"An amazing place with the best view one can get in Harsil. One can experience the best of his time here with River Bhagirathi flowing alongside the resort and the snow clad mountains with beautiful and pleasent weather. Also, the place is very good. The best part of the stay are the owners of this place. The three brothers handle this place very well. They made me feel as if I was at my own house. They provided us with all the possible services despite the village being far away from the main city. They were extremely friendly and fun loving. It was an awesome stay with nature all around and such lovely people around us.",Rahul Mehta,/Profile/rahul_mehta0203,"Mumbai, India",50
uttarkashi,Nelangana resorts at Harsil was our choice to stay enroute to Gangotri. Most people stay at Uttarkashi which is rather crowded.Nelangana has this cosy homely feeling the moment you set in. Its on the banks of the Bhagirathi river and one cant find enough words to describe that view. The rooms are smart and done well. Food is yum at all times. Here I must mention that the owners of Nelangana are hospitable and care about their guests personally. The resort gives you a home feeling. ,preethijaidev,/Profile/preethij72,"Thane, India",50

uttarkashi,The location is outstanding just beside river Ganga. One can actually walk up to the river. The rooms are clean and tastefully done. Dinner was tasty. Personal attention was given by the owners to individual guests. The staff was very helpful and warm,Archana B,/Profile/445archanab,,50
uttarkashi,"Located on a pristine meadow just beside the river, this place is stunning! The rooms are luxurious and aesthetically designed with clear and unobstructed views of snow capped peaks, the mighty Ganges and lush green meadows that one can stare at all day. The rooms have every single thing that top hotels across the world offer- Heating, comfortable and clean bed linen and great room service. Being on this property, i found a sense of calm which is very hard to describe. The food is great too and the staff is extremely warm. However, apart from the property, the best part about this place is -Shiraz, the owner. I'm quite convinced he's probably the coolest person in the country right now. He's extremely welcoming and at the same time knows how to give people their space. A",devanka ghosh,/Profile/devanka,Mumbai,50
uttarkashi,"Superb aesthetics. Beautifully blended with the location itself. And amazing hospitality and service. The brothers run a wonderful place.  We landed there by accident as it was raining and freezing and we were woefully underequipped on bikes. We were immediate taken in and while we had planned a night stay and then off, we ended up staying 3 days. Purely because of the kind of people who ran the place. Knowledgeable about the whole place, helpful and with an excellent team.thank you Shiraz and gang.",Shashanka Ghosh,/Profile/Wishfulbiker,"Mumbai, India",50

uttarkashi,I had visited a long time back but I was waiting to write perfect comments for this place ....I must say that the owner of the place has great ideas to turn it into a beautiful friendly place for people who are less abled and also on wheelchair.... when I visited the place it was still in the process of being build... I did share my suggestions with the owner which he very gracefully understood and said would work on it.... the entrance to the gate was full of cement because the place was being made but I am sure it must have been made by now and one can take their car just right in the front from where one has to climb about 4 steps to get to the nearest step free room ....the owner said he was going to definitely think about making ramps for wheelchair people to get around,wheelchairandeye,/Profile/Pammu_Parvinder,"Mumbai, India",50

uttarkashi,my family were on this Pilgimage which included Ganggotri in June 2017. we spent i nite here. i must say the roome were simply superb. The service was excellent. More of a family kind of stay where everybody is helpful. situated on the banks of the river Gangga with the Himalajan foothills backdrop it is really awesome. There is no phone no Tv you are one with mother Nature. At night there is a camp fire where you can sit around with stories to listen. i honestly regret we stayed only for one night so me n my daughter are going back soon for a longer stay.syabas to the excellent management,kirpalani99,/Profile/kirpalani99,"Johor Bahru, Malaysia",50
uttarkashi,"We stayed here for 2 nights with triple occupancy to accommodate three of us. It was all friends trip. Entire route to reach Nelangana was picturesque with mountains, river and coniferous trees. It was easy to locate the resort as the owners made sure they advertise the hotel board at the major crossings and turns. Location of the hotel was beyond our imagination. It was located on the banks of river Bhagirathi. All rooms are river and mountain facing. Rooms were neat and clean, only problem was with insects of the jungle that can be found in around hotel. Best part of the hotel was there service in terms of food. You name it and the owners Shiraz and Sameer will make sure you will get it, specially lunch and dinner. All staff were soft spoken and helpful. The property has",Jai0787,/Profile/Jai0787,"New Delhi, India",50
