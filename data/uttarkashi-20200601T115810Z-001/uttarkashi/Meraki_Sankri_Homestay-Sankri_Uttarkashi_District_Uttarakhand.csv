uttarkashi,"I stayed at Meraki Sankri on my solo trip for the Kedarkantha trek. Nitish and Sandeep were extremely helpful in guiding me in planning my trip and resolving my multiple queries. When I finally landed at Sankri, I was blown away - the location was stunning, the place was extremely clean (this when there's trekkers with dirty boots tramping in and out all the time!), and the crew were super warm and hospitable. The experience of a homestay was all that I was looking for and more. The trek itself was fantastic, and though we could not summit due to heavy snowfall closing the route, the Meraki guys ensured we were still able to make the absolute most of whatever was possible (maggi and popcorn up on the mountain wasn't something I was expecting :).

uttarkashi,"Meraki homestay has now become my home,away from home. This time i stayed here and did the kedarkantha trek. Apart from kedarkantha and har ki dun trek,Sankri has a lot more in store. I thank the whole team of meraki triangle to help me explore the local villages saur and jakhol and introduce me to their beautiful culture and tradition.  There is something unique and peaceful about this place. Cozy and comfortable rooms,beautiful artworks,amazing music and pretty lighting elevates its beauty and makes you enchanted.

uttarkashi,"Though we are not trekkers we decided to spend diwali in a quiet and beautiful hamlet of sankri at Meraki triangle. It's a beautiful property overlooking the mountains. The rooms are spacious, cozy and comfortable. We had a room on the first floor which had wooden floorboards hence the room was warm. The entire first floor has a sit out where you can enjoy reading a book over a cup of tea or coffee. The staff is very attentive and efficient and takes care of all your needs. They do not have attached toilets or bathrooms. They have a separate bathroom for women apart from common ones. That is one concern. The food is wholesome and tasty prepared by the cook, mr. Thapa, a very genial person. For those who are not avid trekkers, there are a lot of intersting village treks one can",algaari,/Profile/algaari,"Mumbai, India",40

Spacious and cozy rooms that opens to a balcony overlooking the tips of mount Swargarohini and Lekha top, Meraki is truly perched at the right spot.   Food: It's foodgasm during the stay. Name it and you can have it.   Location: A few hundred meters from the Sankri main market area.   Entertainment: Play area, engaging in the artistic endeavors around the whole property.

This year too, we chose to stay in this beautiful art house before our Har Ki Dun trek. Amazing food, cozy rooms and above all...warmest people.   Plan to go for Phulara Ridge next year.

uttarkashi,"We fell in love with this place the first night when we arrived. The mountain views, traditional art and the music gave the place a magical and homely feel.   The rooms are spacious, clean and cozy. The food is even better, I still crave for the fried paneer and potatoes, pizza bread, mashed potatoes and a special pasta dish.   The surrounding village is beautiful and quiet, with lovely good-hearted people.   The host, Sandeep, is an amazing person. We enjoyed many conversations with him and learned a lot of the surroundings.  He also has exceptionally good taste is music.  For all of these reasons we decided to extend our stay.",Maria A,/Profile/MariaA8647,,50
uttarkashi,"I recently went for Kedarkantha trek via EUttranchal and had a Homestay at Meraki Triangle in Sankri.  Not to mention, the stay was so hospitable and comfortable, I almost felt like home.  The moment I reached the homestay after 8 hours travel from Dehradun,I was served with tea and fries.that was so home-like. And the entire stay was quite good.  The rooms are warm and comfortable.  The staff is quite courteous and kind.  The food served was awesome. Plus the design of the homestay made of wood is quite unique and beautiful.  Also, there's a meaning behind the name - Meraki ! ;-)  Mearki stands for putting our heart and soul into something that we do with love and creativity.  The place very well resonates with the meaning !  Try out a stay at Meraki Triangle and I'm sure you",Swati,/Profile/Swatt94Bali,,50
uttarkashi,"I was with Meraki staff at Sankri for 5 nights with my wife and 3 children. We stayed there and also did Kedarkanth hike planned by them. Thanks to good planning by Sandeep and great support by Pramod, Gajendra Rawat & staff we all managed to reach the peak and finished hike 1day ahead of schedule. The youngest one is just 4.5yrs old so we had to pick her up but Pramod managed that very well. Nice views of waterfall, snow capped mountains and step fields from the home stay itself and also opportunities to do many short walks around Sankari. There is a long zipline also nearby. The food was also very good. 5 days seemed short for this place. Thanks again Meraki Crew for making it memorable off-beat holidays.",Parikshit Chhabra,/Profile/ParikshitChhabra,,50
uttarkashi,"We stayed in Meraki homestays for one night on our way to Kedarkantha trek and one more night after we came back. As one would expect, a trek starting point should offer nothing fancy but a good night's sleep, clean toilets and homemade food. The Meraki homestay offers all of these and additionally, warm hospitality, calm and serene locale in the lap of the mighty Himalayas. During winter, you can see snow clad peaks from here. Last but not the least, it is designed beautifully to give you an escape from the humdrum city life. Fight club movie quotes, Murakami and Marquez books and Himalaya... Contemplate about life, reenergize and rejuvenate. Overall, highly recommend.  Ohh, did I mention that it snowed in Sankri this year?",Riddhi Pratim G,/Profile/RiddhiPratimG,,50

The rooms are spacious, warm and very clean. The toilets are clean and the best thing about this trekkers abode is you get plenty of hot water for your bath!  The food is delicious too. We stayed just one night before we left for Gaichwan  Gaon on the other side of the hill to join our trekking group for Kedarkantha. We wished we stayed more.

The rooms were clean and tidy. Although the loos were separate, they were clean and hygienic. The cafe area serves as an open area where one could play table tennis, chess, play guitar or just relax with friends. The artwork adorning the wall is so pretty. Not to forget the delectable food on the menu!  Honestly, it's the good vibes of a place thatI look for, and it was certainly present at Meraki.",Abhay A,/Profile/548abhaya,,50
