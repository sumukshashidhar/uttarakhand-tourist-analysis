uttarkashi,"For a weary traveller, finding a hotel close to the dropping point or pick-up point is a blessing.  This hotel fits that requirement as it is situated between taxi stand and bus stand within half km of each.  For the devotees of Lord Shiva, this hotel is just 10 minutes walk from the very ancient Vishwanath temple.  The District Hospital and shops are also near the temple.  A very large number of vegetable/fruit vendors are lined up near the bus stand.  When I visited the hotel, I was very sick and sought help from the hotel staff.  They directed me to the medical facility nearby and also cooked dhalia specially for me and kept checking on my health till I left the hotel next day.  The room I got had basic amenities....clean bed and towels, clean bathroom.  Geyser switch in the",Subrahmanyam NK,/Profile/SubbuNewYork,"Bengaluru, India",30

uttarkashi,"Budget hotel close to bus stand & Vishwanath Mandir, has small rooms with basic requirements just to pass your night while traveling. Meals are only available during yatra season. Many dhabas are near to it, Patiala Restaurent is nice option near vishwanath temple. Some rooms have foul smell due to dampness so it is suggested to book road side rooms having sunlight.",NISHANKSAROHI,/Profile/NISHANKSAROHI,"Uttarkashi, India",30

uttarkashi,"This is one of our favorite places to eat and stay. It's very convenient for all sites in Uttar Kashi, but the main road can be dusty and noisy. Biggest advantages are access to Choice Computer next door, and all of the main Mandirs across the street. They cook the food to your specifications and serve in the ground floor restaurant or up on the terrace or in your room. Request a backside room upstairs for quiet, or frontside if you want some views.",atmananda,/Profile/atmananda,Uttar Kashi,40
uttarkashi,"It is at walk able distance from the market area, and away from the traffics and noises. Nice hotel, clean enough. Restaurant facility not available, but they provide snacks, tea, coffee in the room. If you wish to stay overnight at Uttarkashi during a long trip, this is a good choice and value for money. Hotel guys are also helpful and nice.",gkaustav,/Profile/gkaustav,"Noida, India",30
uttarkashi,"This was the place which provided me with Accommodation and a great amount of help during the recent Uttarakhand Disaster (2013). Never in that duration of five days when I was stuck at Uttarkashi, did they make me feel sad or burdened. They were the people who would provide you with the hope and joy. Services were top-notch and even the Maintenance. To find someone like the owner of this Hotel at such time came to be a great relief for us. It is central and most importantly, provides you with almost every facility.  whenever we used to ask him if he would readily accept for Money Transfer as we fell short of Hard Cash, He used to say, Don't Worry about it. Just live here and then we will see. And at the end he charged 15% less than what was decided at the time of booking. ",JainBhavya,/Profile/JainBhavya,"New Delhi, India",40
uttarkashi,"Actually 'Bhandari' is a brand name in adventure tourism in Uttarkashi. The entire place is neat and clean and is  managed professionally. The owners are through gentleman and personally take care of your needs. In case you are visiting Uttarkashi as a team for 'Trekking Expeditions', Bhandari Anexxe is the only place offering extra facilities for pilgrim groups and expeditions. Here you will meet two special characters 'Rastrapati Ji' and 'Pandit Ji'. Both are oldies and do most of the jobs from service to house keeping. 'Pandit Ji' is loud and might disturb you early in the morning offering tea, don't get annoyed as starting  early is part of the mountain manners !  Parking is available and they have a small shop at the reception to take care of your petty  travel needs.",Mountain_Shepherds,/Profile/Mountain_Shepherds,"Auli, India",50
uttarkashi,"We checked in for a night's stay on our way back from Gangotri. We checked in late in the evening and to our surprise the manager gave us Rs. 100 discount from the published rate! Room is very basic but clean, no stains anywhere and the WC was in good condition.  There are limited hygienic eateries in Uttarkashi. In Bhanadari Annexe you need to place your order latest by 7:30 pm if you plan to have dinner there. They served hot simple Indian food and it was less spicy, we loved it! room service was quick, we were happy. Even breakfast was good and reasonably priced! Bhandari Annexe is one of the very few hotels in Uttarkashi where you get omelet! Our room was road facing and had a small balcony. The view was nice in the night & in the morning. But if you are a light sleeper",Arunangshu_Roy,/Profile/Arunangshu_Roy,Mumbai,40
