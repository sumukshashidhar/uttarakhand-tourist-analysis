uttarkashi,"Thank you for our wonderful stay for 2 nights for our Chardham Group,  Special thanks to Chandra Mohan and his team for taking care of us with excellent accommodation, great food and service.  Location of hotel is just awesome with valley facing rooms and just 1.5 kms from Barkot Market.  Overall a great group stay. Highly recommended.",royalescape,/Profile/royalescape,"Jaipur, India",50
