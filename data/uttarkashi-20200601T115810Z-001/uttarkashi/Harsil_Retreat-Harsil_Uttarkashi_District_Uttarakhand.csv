uttarkashi,The cottages are very beautiful. Good food and other facilities. Parking not possible nearby as the road is not fit for big vehicles to be taken till the hotel. Harsil is a beautiful village with apple orchards and river Bhagirathi flowing beside it.,Anuj,/Profile/879anujj,"Faridabad, India",40
uttarkashi,Stayed at Harshil retreat in May   . The hotel and cottages not very well maintained . The staff not trained shortage of manpower as only three people to cater to seven cottages. Food so so . Hot water by solar heater so not adequate for so many cottages . Location is excellent serene surroundings but property needs to be maintained and managed well.There is another property adjacent to this by name of Himalayan nature resort which is far better ,Shilpi,/Profile/shilpisinghal,"Greater Noida, India",30
uttarkashi,"Ended up here by chance following the floods and landslides in the Himalayas. Mr Mehta the owner made us feel at home.  The service was excellent, food lovely and accommodation comfortable and clean.   The location was beautiful surrounded by snow capped mountains and fast flowing streams.  Would definitely go again.  Thanks Mr Mehta for your hospitality Dr Avtar Ghattaora, Nottingham, UK",Sukhi G,/Profile/SukhiG,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",50

uttarkashi,"What a place! Green coniferous covered mountains, gushing tributaries in a hurry to empty out into the Bhagirati and lovely walks. We spent 3 nights at Harsil Retreat and we had a great time. The staff was helpful and the meals were good. Mr Mehta was always full of stories and anecdotes. It is situated on the banks of one of Jalandhari, so you have a sound of water constantly. The famous Raja of Harsil's bungalow is just opposite the property though now not as great as the original bungalow might have been. The Tibetan village is close by and the one street town a 5 minute walk away.There are not many places to stay in Harsil except for a few small hotels in the main street. We noticed a new hotel being developed right next door. Gangotri is close by and can be visited in half",SangeetaG,/Profile/SangeetaG,Pune,40
uttarkashi,"Me and My wife visited the place between May 2nd to May 4th , It was just Awesome . We took a cab from Dehradun and reached Harsil in 7 hrs of Gruesome travel . But the Moment we reached , we have enthralled by the beauty and Mr. Mehta . Mr. Mehta took us with personal care . The beauty of Harsil lies in the sound of Wind blowing through the Deodar trees and Buzzling river of Bagirathi . Truly a hidden gem .  Harsil retreat accommodation is luxuriously Basic , at  9000ft this is best accommodation you can find in the area . What you can expect is   1. Great food --> Esp with Local made Rajma 2. Excellent service from Mr Mehta 3. Sound of Wind and River  4. Snow capped peaks staring at you all around (Even in the Month of May)  Harsil should be go to place for the Nature lovers",karthikjoshii,/Profile/karthikjoshii,chennai,40
uttarkashi,"Nature in its most majestic self - Harsil is for those that want a glimpse of heaven. Surrounded by snow peaks, the sound of rushing rivers, pure air to breathe, a view of a crystal clear night sky as you sit around a warm fire, white waterfalls, treks of discovery - it was an out of this world experience. Three loud cheers to Rajiv Mehta for putting up such a place - it is his lovely touches and attention to detail that make your stay even more special. A wonderful place for a family visit. Our kids were amazed that they could have sooo much fun, even without a TV in the room. Ideal place to stay wrt Gangotri - you can make a great day trip. Can still see and hear all the magical sights and sounds every time I close my eyes - Harsil is a place that will remain in your heart",SeemaGurgaon,/Profile/SeemaGurgaon,Gurgaon,50
uttarkashi,"If nature is your thing and if you are not put off by silence and a laid-back existence, then Harsil is the ideal place for you. Harsil is a footnote in the book on spiritual pilgrimages.... it is a tiny hamlet 20 kms before Gangotri that most pilgrims pass on their quest for salvation. We stopped at Harsil. For us, Harsil was the main destination. After a long drive all the way from Haridwar we reached late in the evening. Harsil Retreat is a set of cottages. The location is unbelievable and right out of a fantasy. But I will come back to that a little later. The cottages are wooden and nothing very fancy. The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms neat. What you appreciate is the clean linen, soft quilts, the big glass windows that lets you see the mountains outside. The food",Diptesh G,/Profile/dipteshg,gurgaon,50
uttarkashi,"If you love nature in true sense Harsil is the place, I have seen a few nature lovers, but put in to a real natural place they complain about so many things, this is such a place where one can judge oneself.  Feelings can not be described in reality so I leave it up to the feelings only. I could not find a better place than Harsil Retreat there. Donâ€™t expect luxury but find the beauty of majestic Himalayas, and true good food. There is nothing to do, just walk in the wilderness, which is gift of kind nature, rediscover the self",shibasisc,/Profile/shibasisc,Delhi,40
uttarkashi,"The thought of Harsil Retreat after a visit, itself gives immense pleasure .. as one can't easily forget the luxury of well designed cottages, filled with warmth and comfort as compared to the extreme climates prevailing there. The mountains surrounding this retreat also give an inexplicable pleasure with the gurgling Jalandhari, and Bhagirathi rivers passing by along with the green lining of Coniferous trees. The campfire lit during the chilly nights gives you a different level of unbounded joy !!     The rarified air prevailing here...simply refreshes the mind !! The hospitality and reception of Mr. Rajiv Mehta on reaching this retreat is marvellous - i felt the warmth and reception i always felt on reaching home !! The staff here are very helpful and their services are simply",Adarsh N,/Profile/AdarshN_11,N. Delhi,40
uttarkashi,"These cottages are sorrounded by Deodar trees and on the banks of Bhagirathi and River Jalandhri confluence just next to the lord Vishnu's temple, quite and calm with very good facilities, Mr. Rajiv Mehta's knowliedge of surrounding area is excellent. The cottages are warm and cosy. And the best part was the running hot water bath which refreshed my whole body aches after the long journey. The staff provided a great hospitality. The food was really nicely cooked. The ajwain paranthas were awesome.",AnilRajput,/Profile/AnilRajput,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",40
