uttarkashi,"It would not be incorrect to say that among all accommodation options in the beautiful, tiny village of Harsil, GMVN is indeed the best in terms of its location as well as rooms offering some of the most amazing views and the best of all cottage! One could only wish if the management and staff training were also upto the mark. Not that the staff is rude, but they are indifferent, lax and apathetic towards guest service (again, not all of them, but most except a few). Imagine taps going dry and no water in the washrooms, when you are staying right next to the gushing Bhagirathi! And when the overhead water storage tanks are eventually filled after pursuing the staff for long enough and wasting precious morning time which could have been well utilized to start a nice long day out",Kushal Sharma,/Profile/KushalUlagam,"New Delhi, India",30
uttarkashi,"We have taken three rooms ( Hut, Super Deluxe & Deluxe) & stayed there for 2 days. Hut is very good but small compared to super deluxe rooms, but view & location of Hut is awesome. Bathroom fittings are almost new and there was no issue of Hot water. From taxi stand, GMVN is around 500 meters leisurely walk. One can take help of GMVN staff to carry luggage ( 20/- per bag/suitcase). Food at GMVN is bit bit costly.  But considering remoteness, it's OK. Taste is OK. We have to order 3 hours before. Breakfast is complimentary.  On request,  GMVN can arrange Bon-fire (800 to 1000/-) in evening.  Overall,  a memorable stay.",Biswajit_Pal,/Profile/Biswajit_Pal,"Vadodara, India",40

uttarkashi,Harsil is a magical place. Surrounded by towering snow peaks and with the presence of cascading bhagirathi it's a gem.  Gmvn Harsil is a nice place to detox and rejuvenate.  We stayed at deluxe hut which has clear view of the river. The food is homely and the people very hospitable.   We visited gangotri dharali and Mukhwa while staying at Harsil.

uttarkashi,River side cottages are awesome to stay. Limited food options but it's alrite as the place is remote. You need to walk (easy one) about 100 mtrs. Possibly one of the best place to stay around gangotri. Very economical. ,Swetabh P,/Profile/swetabhp,"Mumbai, India",50

I have visited there just after fresh snowfall, there was no electricity due to snowfall but staff was co-operative & providing services at their best possibilities, they provided us Dal-Chawal,Roti& Sabji... Hot water bucket at minimum extra cost. Rooms were Normal but if u go out in the lawn you get mesmerized by views, can spent time in transparent glass covered hut where you can order tea, can play cards.

uttarkashi,"1) This GMVN TRH is located in the banks of the Bhagirathi in a valley with stunning Himalayan landscapes,25-30kms and 40 minutes away from Gangotri. 2) You have to take a small walk of 5 minutes through the beautiful village to reach the rest house from the small taxi stand.The Hotel assistants will carry your luggage. 3) The two Super-Deluxe rooms, costing 2700 bucks including GST,in 1st floor are the best.Online booking can be made through GMVN website.A new separate cottage/hut,in close proximity of the river banks,not available online,has been recently added. 4)The food served in the spacious dining hall at the ground floor is of limited variety though.Enjoy your tea or breakfast at the glasshouse at the backside of the restaurant. 5) The Hotel surrounds are neat and clean",Soutik H,/Profile/soutikh2015,"Kolkata, India",50

uttarkashi,No one can beat it's location.this property has stunning view of flowing river with apple orchards all around. ...the most negative point about this property is it's rooms.. pathetic.. This property is arr.35_40 years old..and they are having still same furniture.from 40 years.. government should take steps to renovate such a beautiful place. ..

uttarkashi,The GMVN TRH is located with an excellent view of the Bhagirathi. The gazebos are an excellent place for having your breakfast and tea. A walk along the river is also a necessary attraction of this place.  The staff is friendly and is helpful.

uttarkashi,We had a 4 night stay and we regretted the moment we reached here. 1. Staff is not at all welcoming and very rude ESP the manager over there. 2. Property accessible only by foot. Car is to be parked at the public spot. 3. We reached on a rainy night and had babies and senior citizens with us. After various calls they simply refused to help us with luggage  We had to make 3 rounds to carry our luggage to hotel. From parking to hotel it's 10 mins walk. 4. Their rooms and beds are in very poor condition. Mattresses have worms.  5. During our entire stay not even once our rooms were cleaned. 6. Food is average. Portions are very small. We had to listen quiet a lot if we asked them to increase number of food plates later. It was funny that we paid for food and yet listened to how,Pooja K,/Profile/PoojaK172,"Faridabad, Haryana, India",20
uttarkashi,"TRH is situated on the banks of Bhagirathi, beautiful location, but one has to walk till resort for about 500 mt. with luggage. Working under constraints , the manager Mr. Samual is doing exlent work giving personal care to the guests. Desk man Mr. Rana, the kitchen man Mr. Prem and all othe staff are cordial and always ready to work. The power supply was disturbing as often coming and going. Generator has low capacity.  Harsil small hamlet about 25 km before Gangotri has un imaginary beauty. I stayed 2 nights and had comfortable stay. Gushing sound of the river Bhagirathi has a unique experience. The facilities can be improved in this TRH if GMVN recognises the value of Harsil for nature lovers. ",nalinkpande,/Profile/nalinkpande,"Almora, India",50

uttarkashi,This place needs to be visited for surrounded beauty which they offer and its a feast for eyes and soul for sure. Located on river bank and surrounded by trees what else you want ? And due to proximity to army cantonment next to it no further development is allowed so this place seats like a king.  Property is modest but due to its location it gets the tourist flow. Rooms and bathrooms are average so are the beds and linen but few people choose to spend more time inside in compare to outside.  They have made seating arrangement near to river bank inside the property so you can have you refreshment / books / kindle while overlooking a flowing water / green trees and birds right from morning to evening.

uttarkashi,The USP of the hotel is the view of Bhagirathi river. One can spend hours sitting at the gazebos viewing the river. Infact that is a much better idea as the rooms are very cramped and there is no view from the room. The hotel staff is very prompt and food is very good. Non-veg food is available.

Harsil is a beautiful, remote hamlet in the upper Himalayas. Do stop by here and enjoy its surroundings.

The property is about 200 meters away from the motorable road. This means one has to walk that distance with ones luggage along a narrow winding pathway. Porters are available though.

The rooms (even the superior Super Deluxe) are so small that an extra bed can take away any space to move within the room. Given the remoteness of the place, the staff (especially Prem) is quite helpful and responsive.

Location is on river bed with grand views of valley and just opposite of army camp so if you are not an indian resident than you might have to check with gmvn people about some permit due to army presence norms.

Better to call them direct.The GMVN Rishikesh office should be able to give you the Harsil number. We got bookings for only two nights online though we wanted for three and when we arrived we found rooms were available aplenty.   The guest house far exceeded our expectations.
