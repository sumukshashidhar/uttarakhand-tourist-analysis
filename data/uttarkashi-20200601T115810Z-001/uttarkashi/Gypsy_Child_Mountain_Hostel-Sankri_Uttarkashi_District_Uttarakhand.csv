uttarkashi,"A good place to stay where decent stay arrangements, good food and cleanliness is taken care off. Location is picture perfect. Sitting outside the hostel with a cup of team early morning is a time well spent. Definitely looking forward to come to this place again, this time with family.",Sunil S,/Profile/SunilS2992,,50

uttarkashi,I stayed in Gypsy Child hostel on my way back from the Kedarkantha trek. The staff are very kind and friendly. The rooms were clean and the bunks warm and cozy. The bathrooms were also well maintained. I would definitely come back here and recommended this place to anyone who is stopping by in Saur. ,Niharika N,/Profile/337niharikan,,50

Clean washrooms Cons: 1. Paid hot water  2. Weak telephone signal  3. 1.5 KM away from main sankari market  4. Common room is very small   Special Mention: Loved the photographs taken by owners which hung in all rooms,vivek_enzo,/Profile/vivek_enzo,"Mumbai, India",40
uttarkashi,"I happened to chance upon this beautiful hostel while I was in Sankri for a night before trekking up to Kedarkantha. The trekking company I went with had put us up in another homestay so I didn't get a chance to stay there. But on my last night i was walking around the town looking for a place to eat at and there it was! The owners have done a fantastic job at putting this place together. It was a very chill vibe with plenty to do - Carrom, Mini Table Tennis, lovely music and snacks to munch on while enjoying the bonfire. My last night in Sankri was memorable thanks to this place! Would definitely recommend people to stay here if they are in Sankri or crossing it.",Manisha V,/Profile/manishavasdev,"New Delhi, India",50
uttarkashi,We stayed here by chance at the start of an organised trek but would definitely come back to spend a little more time here when next in India. Has a really laid back atmosphere and a great platform from which to explore the surrounding mountains and local village. The people who own it are so friendly and really interesting and offer various activities/ suggestions for how to spend your time.  ** picture features view from the hostel not the actual place,Ayla S S,/Profile/aylass,"London, United Kingdom",50
