uttarkashi,The TRH is neat and clean.  Staff is very cooperative and friendly.  The place has a well maintained garden.  While going to yamunotri this is a better option to stay as compared to the GMVN Hanuman Chatti! Value for money accommodation!,Alpana71,/Profile/Alpana71,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",40
uttarkashi,We stopped nd stayed at GMVN Barkot main hotel not the new annexe one. It's a good place with nearby market nd basic facility. Rooms r quite good. Bathroom fine. No problems related to hotel infrastructure. Manager Mr. Mahavir is good person with friendly nature. Kitchen manager Mr. Rawat cooked really delicious food. However we kept the food simple as we r in journey. We stopped there after our Yumnotri Yatra for 1night. Recommended. ,Amit Agarwal,/Profile/AmitA2071,"Howrah, India",40
uttarkashi,"We reached the GMVN at Barkot haggard and weary, after a long day of travel. We had been to Har ki Dun and the last day had been hot and full of unexpected delays. It was almost 9PM by the time we reached the hotel, desperately in search of a hot shower, fresh food and a bed. Our expectations were exceeded by far. The newly renovated property has great amenities and the most helpful staff who not only served us cups of refreshing tea upon arrival but also kept the kitchen open just to that our dinner could be served hot.  The hotel is an ideal stopover for travellers chalking the Yamunotri trail looking for comfort at a decent price. ",Perched,/Profile/Perched,"The Hague, The Netherlands",40
uttarkashi,Food was average. Service was not upto the mark. Staff is cordial upto a mark. Rooms aren't maintained as they should have been. Despite all these flaws the average rating is just because I couldn't find better hotel in Barkot plus GMVN is the last resort for travellers if they don't find any. Hoping for the change in work culture. ,Harendra B,/Profile/HarendraB18,"Dehradun, India",30
uttarkashi,This building have newly constructed 4 rooms and we have all the rooms. Food was not available there as they need to ask the same from old GMVN which is 1 kms away. Location and others things are good.,girraj2018,/Profile/girraj2018,"New Delhi, India",40

uttarkashi,"3 of us stayed at Gmvn Barkot on 7th and 8th May. We had most pleasant experience here. The rooms are nice, clean, bathroom is very good. All the staff including management is very helpful and caring. Food at restaurant is also very good. We recommend everyone visiting Yamunotri to stay at Gmvn Barkot",arnabchoudhury78,/Profile/arnabchoudhury78,"Kolkata, India",50
uttarkashi,"Taking a detour from the Gangotri route because of bad weather we chanced upon GMVN Barkot en route to Yamunotri. Without a prior booking we were gladly welcomed by the Barkot team and made to feel at home within a few minutes of our arrival.Courteous staff, yummy food came every step of the way.And boy we were mighty pleased!! Wishing this great team loads of good wishes and success in the long run..Take a Bow! :) ",Sugar R,/Profile/425sugarr,,50
uttarkashi,"Our initial plan was to visit Gomukh but due to heavy rain we changed the plan and planned to visit Yamunotri. We did not have any prior booking but GMVN Barkot provided us accommodation for 2 days. Their hospitality is really good and we are very happy to stay in this hotel. Delicious food, hot water etc available whenever we asked. Thanks to the staffs.",dsuranjana,/Profile/dsuranjana,"Kolkata, India",50
uttarkashi,"""WELL BEGUN IS HALF DONE"" The correct order for Chardham Yatra according to Vedas and Vaastu is west to east hence Yamunotri-Gangotri-Kedarnathji-Badrinathji. This makes Yamunotri the first Dham and Barkot the very first place to visit thus making it important. We reached Barkot at 3.00PM via GMOU bus and GMVN is just beside the bus stop.   Barkot is a very small beautiful and last town before Yamunotri and thus not many options of stay are available. Different camps are available but there are many problems with them as from being highly overpriced to being very cold at night as alongside river to mosquito and hygiene problems. I would definately recommend against camps especially when along with family and elderly people as in my case. Other options being Hotel Devbhoomi,",Nawanit S,/Profile/NawanitS2,"Purnea, India",50
uttarkashi,There is two property of GMVN in barkot...TRH and Yatri nivas....I booked 6 rooms through gmvn website....rooms are basic with big bathrooms....running shortage of water but its ok.....the best part of hotel is food...we made gujarati veg (sev temato) by using their utensils which they allowed....so it was home made dinner experience.,pineshmoradia,/Profile/pineshmoradia,"Ankleshwar, India",40
uttarkashi,"Stayed here with family as part of my Char Dham yatra in May 2016 for 2 days. The rooms are basic. There is power backup which is very much required. The food served in nice. The bathrooms have geysers and adequate water supply. The hotel area is nicely decorateed with flowering plants, saw plenty of roses. There is parking area available.",manonita83,/Profile/manonita83,"Bengaluru, India",40
uttarkashi,"This is a nice cozy hottel with a large terrace just outside your room where you can sit, laze in the sun and forget yourself in the distant Himalayan peaks. Run by GMVN and being a government run facility, this suffers from mediocre service. But it is comfortable, clean, nicely located far from the market, food is home cooked by the guard on duty and overall cozy.",Amit G,/Profile/yatrasuru,"Bengaluru, India",40
