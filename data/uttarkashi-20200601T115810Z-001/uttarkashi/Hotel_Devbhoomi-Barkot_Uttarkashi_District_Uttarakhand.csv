uttarkashi,I visited hotel devbhoomi in may 2018 with family and friends. It was an awesome experience being there. Its prime location helped a lot in saving time. The rooms were neat and clean. Hotel stff was very nice and helpful. Hospitality received by the owner and the entire hotel staff was mindblowing  it seemed like a home like exp. The tasty food was and added advantage and clean kitchen was another nice thing about this place. These people really went many extra miles for their customer's delight. The sign boards on roads were really helpful to locate this place easily. I recommend this place to all who are out for their nice mountaineering experience in uttrakhand.,Pooja S,/Profile/padmamalinid,,50
uttarkashi,"Ample parking space, spacious rooms.centrally located. House keeping to be improved, restaurant is lowsy, not at all clean. No wifi. Only thing we don't have much options in barkot, so have to compromise ",Baburajnair,/Profile/Baburajnair,"Coimbatore, India",40
uttarkashi,I stayed in this hotel for a night and found the rooms were not at all clean and maintained.  The price of the room and food is highly overpriced and not at all Value for Money. The owner Mr. Dinesh was cooperative and changed our room on the request but still I could found spider web in the room.,nitin gupta,/Profile/nits0608,,20
uttarkashi,This is average hotel about 10-12 feet below road and ground level. You can not open windows because of basement like position  Rooms have rats... you will be scared to keep your luggage untorn  Pathetic food... Only potato all the time in breakfast and dinner because it is cheap... other vegetables are available at 15 meter away shop  After taking money in advance from agent manager tried to rip me off by taking same amount again second time but finally issue resolved - he kept me waiting for 1-2 hours in reception till he taken few hundreds extra from agent.    Selling triple room at higher price but providing double room with just mattress and size of double room hardly allow mattress and then you do not have standing place in room. Please look for any other hotel in vicinity,Niravni,/Profile/Niravni,"Pune, India",20

uttarkashi,"Basic rooms and average service. But then, it's the only good hotel in Barkot and the best place to spend the night. Food quality is good. The hotel is s perfectly located for that night halt during your trip to Yamunotri.",byasanand,/Profile/byasanand,"New Delhi, India",30
uttarkashi,Though the rooms were average with average facility and amenities but certainly the only good hotel in barkot. Just outside the town on left side on yamunotri road. They have good parking space cum lawn which other hotel don't. I wasn't expecting special hospitality from a place like barkot so the aura if hotel wasn't a shock for me. Stayed there for 2 nights and booked 2 family rooms. Food was good. Everything was ok. Can recommend this hotel for yamunotri pilgrims.,Lalbahadur,/Profile/Lalbahadur,"Mumbai, India",40
uttarkashi,"Barkot being a small place in Uttarakhand, one doesn't have too many hotel options, so I would request the travellers to keep the expectations low.I stayed in Devboomi in the month of May during my visit to Yamunotri. The staff is helpful, proper parking space, food is decent/homely. Tea/ Coffee is available all the time as per request. We stayed in Room No 102 which had 3 beds and a washroom. The rooms are small with a window in the verandah (the only ventilation). The towels,quilt and bedsheets were not very clean and appeared to be used ones. My travel agent had classified Devbhoomi as Deluxe hotel but if I compare it to a Standard hotel in Manali, Devbhoomi should be rated lower than that. The hindi kahavat ""Andho me kana raja"" is suitable to hotel Devbhoomi because it is",Prakriti A,/Profile/PrakritiA14,,30
uttarkashi,"Three rooms were booked by tour operator for eight person but on reaching hotel the staff said they provide two four bedded rooms. on insisting and contacting with tour operator three rooms were given. the rooms allotted to me were room no 101,102 and 103 room no 101 was supposed to be drivers room. it had one window opening in varnda and   other in kitchen. there is also a gate which may open outside.  the toilets were chocked. room service is very poor.  Overall the experience was very bad. never recommend this property to any one",babita13,/Profile/babita13,"Jaipur, India",10

uttarkashi,"The hotel is located outside Barkot Town on Yamunotri Road. Even though it is a good property compare to size of town and other hotels available at Barkot, but there is much scope for improvement in term of service, room amenities etc.   The hotel has ample parking space available. Hotel Owner Mr Dinesh Dobhal is very much helpful and do his best to resolve the issues, if any during stay.",Susil G,/Profile/SusilG,Mumbai,30
uttarkashi,This place is conveniently located just outside crowded the Barkot town. This is a good base location for visiting Yamunotri. The rooms are very neat with modern amenities and room fittings. They offer very good food from the restaurant located in the same building. They have ample car parking area. It was a fantastic experience and will definitely be keen to return again.,SivaramSi,/Profile/SivaramSi,"Bengaluru, India",50
