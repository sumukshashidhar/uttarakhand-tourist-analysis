They served rotten vegetable which was stinking. when we noticed and raise the issue that they gave us potato curry. we do not recommend. we were booked on the dinner and breakfast plan by the agent.,DNSingh,/Profile/DNSingh,"Hyderabad, India",10
uttarkashi,"We were booked in this hotel by the travel agent as a last minute booking. Dont expect any luxury, though they have a working  geyser. Rooms are basic.  They have an in-house restaurant, which is okay if you dont feel like walking a bit",karthik0410,/Profile/karthik0410,"Mumbai, India",30
