uttarkashi,We visited Rigveda Resort in Batkot during Chardham Yatra. The rooms are simple and clean (don't expect 4 or 5 star property). Bathrooms are clean and provide toiletries. Staff was very cooperative and always ready to provide service.  We suggest this place to travellers who are peace lovers and want to spend time in the lap of nature.  Party lovers should avoid this place as ambience of the place is more tilted towards spiritual side.

Unlike other resorts, I found the rooms to be extremely clean and well organized. The food though vegetarian was a reflection of the local scenic and excellent. Best thing was the staff and the management. Kudos to them for making my stay wonderful. Additional, perk was as thmey do not serve alcohol there was lack of the usual ruckus that surronds such camps.

Their experience was awesome, as they are not not tripadvisor, i thought let me share on their behalf. On these trips it’s usually so difficult to find an accommodation which makes one happy- but Rigveda is just the place you want for family. The cottages are beautiful nestled in nature’s lap, with amazing views 360 degree. Food - Veg only but yummy.  Staff - Extremely helpful and polite  Location - Views Views and views :) :) Rooms- Clean and comfortable   Later got to know, property is managed by an entrepreneur, Shivani who herself is involved in day to day running of the resort.
