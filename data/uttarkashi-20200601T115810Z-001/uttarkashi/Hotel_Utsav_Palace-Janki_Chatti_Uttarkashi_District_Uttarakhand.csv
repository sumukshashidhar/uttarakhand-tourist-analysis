uttarkashi,"We started from Barkot at 10.15am,hoped to reach before lunch,as it was 48 km only,but after overnight rains there was landslide,so we were stranded for 5 hours and reached Janaki Chatti at around 6pm. I booked via Booking.com,and received call from the owner Mr. Manmohan,as we were getting late, I asked for directions,and  he complied. We were given rooms,rooms were small ,we got them cleaned up,asked for towels,soap,I asked for bulb too,as room was dark,bulb was installed. There were lots of houseflies in the room.the toilets too were not up to the mark.   I asked for the owner,I came to know that he lives in Dehradun,any way the staff was good and prompt, especially  Dharmendra.    We stayed there for 2 nights. The food was good and very much like home cooked.    It  rained",jyotsna,/Profile/jyotsna907,"New Delhi, India",30
