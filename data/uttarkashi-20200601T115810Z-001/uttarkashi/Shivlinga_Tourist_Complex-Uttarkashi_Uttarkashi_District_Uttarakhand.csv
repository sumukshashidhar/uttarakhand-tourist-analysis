uttarkashi,"Had stayed here years ago and was average but this time the new section was great! Rustic furniture,  very clean and comfortable room and the food in the dining room was nice. It was a lovely surprise that in Uttarkashi such a nice hotel could be found. Would definitely stay again.",Marina1614,/Profile/Marina1614,,40
uttarkashi,We had been to uttarkashi during our chardham yatra. We stayed in shivling resort uttarkashi. It's just on the bank's of river ganga. We can hear the flow. So beautiful view of hills and ganga flow. The food is delicious garhwal style. Rooms are well maintained. Overall I suggest this resort for tourist stay in uttarkashi.,latha c,/Profile/lathac23,"Singapore, Singapore",40
uttarkashi,This hotel is situated right on the Banks of Bagirathi River ( Ganga). Based on the tripadvisor comments I requested that room be given in the new wing. the room was excellent with a good view of Ganga.  The front desk was good. the food in the restaurant was simple but good. We were the only persons staying because being Off Season and they did not compromise on anything.,Sundareswaran  T,/Profile/sundareswarant,"Coimbatore, India",40
uttarkashi,"Shivlinga resort or Tourist complex is same place. There are 2 different premises. It looks like guest house..There is no proper cleanness.  Electric plug are not at proper place.. Tea Coffee maker placed in some room is not in working order or you have to keep it in your hand and plug it for use.  If you ask, they start WIFI, BUT low signal.  Food is good and staff is co-operative.. But will surely find option if visiting again.",FAVOURITETOURS,/Profile/FAVOURITETOURS,Rajkot,30
uttarkashi,"Clean and basic requirements are met in this hotel. It offers a good  view of the holy river Ganga from the room. Care must be taken if one chooses to walk to the river as the boulders are slippery and one of us spotted even a snake there,which is of course expected as we are trespassing their territory .Close to shops and temples.The restaurant offers a limited variety of buffet service.",Kaveri H,/Profile/715kaverih,"Chennai, India",40

uttarkashi,"We stayed recently (March 2019) in this property. The new wing was not available, but this being the off-season, we got an excellent room in the old building where we did not have to climb stairs. The view is quite amazing. One can sit for hours in the balcony and soak in the delight of the  Bhagirathi flowing at the back of the hotel. The staff were very helpful and the food good. Overall the room was okay clean; please remember it is on the yatra route, just a kilometer away from the town and temple of Uttarkashi, right on the highway, s It possibly is as good a place in Uttarkashi; probably the best if one wants to avoid crowd and noise. We  got delayed en route, so regrettably, we could stay only one night. We will certainly go back.",Parthodatta,/Profile/Parthodatta,"Kolkata, India",50
uttarkashi,"Stayed her from 10/14/18 to 10/15/18 - as part of Tour group Tirtha Yathra...during Chardham visit in October 2018. the hotel has two blocks - old and new. We stayed in the Old block....bad/very old rooms. Torn and dirty carpets.Wash room was big, but very old, but barely clean. No hot water in wash basin, only for shower.  Room comes with hot watre kettle and some coffee/condiments....so had early morning coffee before getting out. Reception staff do not speak English.

uttarkashi,I have stayed here many times during my visits to UK. Definitely recommended for people who need a peaceful and nice place. The sound if bhagirathi from behind is so mesmerising.  Some rooms have balcony. I always ask for the room at the far behind to listen to that song.,ranjeetsingh16,/Profile/ranjeetsingh16,"Chandigarh, India",50
uttarkashi,The Hotel is situated over the Gangotri Highway and just besides the Ganges. Rooms were clean and the overall service was very good. We stayed here during our trip to Gangotri. The staffs were helpful.,Arindom,/Profile/Arindomray,"Kolkata, India",40
uttarkashi,"The place is possibly the best option for accommodation in Uttarkashi. We stayed there overnight while on our drive to Gangotri.  The rooms are well appointed, the wifi, though feeble, works, the staff is very helpful and ever smiling and the food is perfect for the hills. The location by the Ganges is the best part if you have your rooms facing the river as ours were. There is ample parking space. The only hitch is the acoustics of the place...tourists start of very early in the mornings and there is a lot of noise and commotion through the corridors and the reception area. Will certainly hamper your early morning sleep. Otherwise, its all fine.",SandyMall,/Profile/SandyMall,"Chennai, India",40

uttarkashi,Hotel is on the way to Gangotri. Rooms are specious and somewhat clean. Hot water is available and towels provided. Breakfast is either paratha or butter toast with chai of course.

uttarkashi,"On our way to Gangotri, we took a halt at Shivlinga Tourist Complex in Uttarkashi. It was a tiring and very exhausting journey from Dehradun Airport to Uttarkashi. It took almost 6 hours to reach and the first immediate thing after reaching was to have a relaxing session. After check-in it was really a nice experience to relax!!!  Check-in process was smooth and there were no issues at the front desk. They had all the necessary details and we immediately rushed to the room.  We opted for Super Deluxe Double room and it was really a nice medium big sized with ample of space to store luggage and relax. The room also had a gallery which was opening right in front of Bhagirathi River. Linen was nice and beautifully maintained. Washroom was nicely equipped. Best thing was all doors",Madhavi Nikhil,/Profile/MadhaviNikhil,"Mumbai, India",50
uttarkashi,"This place have nature on its side sitting just beside the river bed. A pretty big hotel great for groups.  They also have upmarket room under construction which again will be great vfm proposition.  Since this is a touristy locale entire to Gangotri food is generally offers as buffet. Food tastes more home style than restaurant which is good for long travelling tourists. Taste and prepration is better than average.  Staff service is ok for most parts.  Location is just ahead of Uttarkashi city but near to the Temple.  Facilities work fine, which are basic amminities only.  Satisfactory stay.",saargoga,/Profile/saargoga,"Dehradun, India",40

uttarkashi,"Most of the hotels were closed on 21st March, we found the door open and went in. The manager was obliging and gave us one good room of our choice, arranged clean sheets and furniture to our needs and was very helpful in cooking the minimal food requirements. We were the only occupant. We stayed 4 nights, 2 days of Holi festival we spent in our room and strolling in the large lawns and compound. We returned for a night on our way back from Gangotri by which time the hotel was full! Very good and satisfactory stay. thanks to the friendly manager.",dinkar29,/Profile/dinkar29,Pondicherry,40
uttarkashi,Are group of 16 stopped here on our way to a trek to Kush Kalyan and likewise on the way back. The rooms are neat and clean and also were fully ready when we checked in.Almost all the rooms had a beautiful view of the mountains. Located on the banks of the Bhagirathi River makes it an ideal location.  The food served was simple but tasty and prepared like home food. I noticed multiple kitchens so it is possible for groups to arrange their own food. This is what we did on the return journey .  There are also domitary style halls for the budget travellers.,HariBaskaran,/Profile/HariBaskaran,"New Delhi, India",50
uttarkashi,This is nice hotel located close to river. It is away form the city but nice location to spend the night. Service was reasonably good. Room are clean.

uttarkashi,"This is a good place to stay in Uttarkashi. Don't know what the status is now after the floods, but the riverside view and a little bit of lawn in front made for a peaceful setting. I have stayed here twice. A good starting point for Dodi Tal, Kedar Tal, Gowmukh and similar treks. Functional kitchen and restaurant. Compared to a lot of restaurants in Uttarkashi, the food is in this hotel better. Check out the geysers when you check in - they may not work in some rooms. The rates were affordable, but I went both times in the off-season. It is a good 10-15 minutes walk from the township, but that's why I preferred it - Uttarkashi town is pretty noisy. You will get share jeeps also to get to this place.",SajishGP,/Profile/SajishGP,"Bengaluru, India",40
uttarkashi,"Great Location on river banks safe enough for you to see surging Bhagirathi Ganga surge in front of you at holy town of Uttarkashi. Clean rooms, food and good bath before you climb, drive up to higher altitudes where you might not bath even. Stay spot for all who go and come back to, from temple town of Gangotri at 3100 meters. Great hub of mountaineering as NIM is here. Resort is away from town which has no rickshaw etc, walk you must unless you have your own vehicle which most who zip past in char Dham yatra circuit do. Great spot to recuperate after a hard trek like we did as we stayed two days before and later after our Tapowan Shivlinga trek.",Dr Hemant Sant,/Profile/DrHAsant,"Vadodara, India",30
uttarkashi,"The mark of a good hotel is determined by not how they treat their guest when the times are good but how they take care of them when the times are challenging. We were stuck in the Uttarkashi during the recent floods (June 2013) when on a char-dham yatra. We were enroute to Gangotri when we had to return due to heavy rains, landslide and road damage. We stayed in Shivlinga Tourist Complex for five nights. The length of stay was variable as we had no idea how long will it take before the roads to Rishikesh will open. The floods during this time were so severe we saw houses on the opposite bank of Bhagirathi being swept away. There was severe flooding and damage in nearby villages as well.

We were booked into rooms 102 and 101, of which 102 deserves special mention. Though the rooms were big, regular maintenence was low. The attached bathroom was as messy as can be imagined. Leaky flush, poorly lit, non floor, dirty accessories. There was a foul smell too.  We tried changing the room, but the staff were unable to do so. Despite repeated arguments with the Manager we had to stay put in thr room for 2 nights. The Manager suggested that we look out at the Lovely, well maintained garden at the doorstep, what more could we ask for, hinting that our demand for a clean room was unreasonable.

uttarkashi,"This part of Uttarakhand is known for its torturous back-breaking roads. Uttarkashi is even worse with roads full of slush all around. You don't really expect a nice place to stay here overnight and Shivlinga Tourist Complex is a nice surprise. The place is clean and have basic facilities. Further, the backside view of river Bhagirathi makes it worth staying for. But, don't venture for front view, which is the classic dirt road of uttarkashi. The hotel has hot water facility, which is a rare luxury in Uttarkashi. But, this hot water is delivered through the taps not through the shower. Hence, no shower no matter how badly your back aches because of torturous roads of Uttarakhand.",Abhi_P_Bpl,/Profile/Abhi_P_Bpl,"New Delhi, India",30
