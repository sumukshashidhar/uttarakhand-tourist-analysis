uttarkashi,"Himalayan Pligrimage (Char Dham) By Heli The 9 things you need to know before signing up.We did the may-jun (peak time) yatra tour. Best to “book direct” with Heli company as the Heli company is solely responsible, in-charge & control of this tour. Advance booking 2-3 months is sufficient. Alternatively you can consider the sept-oct (less crowd) period. Before signing the booking form & effecting payment insist on talking to Heli coordinator (chief-in-charge) re your rights & obligations for a safe, secured & pleasant pilgrimage tour. 9 things you need to know, sharing from our recent experience ... 1. On the heli tour itself, Important Points to agree upfront are as follows: a. you will provide accurate body weight and can be validated on day of check-in with some variations b.",JSYD,/Profile/SPIRITUALCHARDHAM,,20

uttarkashi,"I stayed here with a group of 20 people while going trekking to Kedarkanth. The hospitality of the owner Balbir ji and his wife (who we referred to as Mama-Maami) was just amazing. They took care of us like their family, they provided happily to whatever we asked. Maami served delicious food in her kitchen and made us eat like her own kids. We all stayed in the cozy wooden room and missed it's warmth while camping. I recommend this place to everyone for the true taste of local pahaadhi culture and hospitality",Paimona,/Profile/Paimona,"Bhopal, India",50
uttarkashi,I visited this place 5 years ago with friends.(It was not on trip advisor then)..But I still remember the amazing hospitality we received there..The family welcomed us with black tea in the evening within minutes of our arrival..cooked us very homely food..most of which was organic n some even included local wild herbs..We were treated with rhodedandron n sebachthron juice for refresments..They arranged for our treks in the region..This is a true Himalayan homestay that will give you a close look at the life in the mountains and the colorful culuture of people living at high altitudes..The family itself is very welcoming and friendly.,Vaibhav,/Profile/iamraje,,50
uttarkashi,"We, a group of 13, stayed there for almost 2 weeks. The location is very appropriate for hiking and long walks. We were contented by the freshness in the air, formidable mountains and serene landscape. You can experience nature in its originality, but at some places it was sad to see people ruining forests by burning them or dumping rubbish simply down the hill or into the brooks.  Balbir ji's family is very warmhearted and hospitable. The house is built a little low so you need to always watch your head. Kamala ji made soups from some indigenous herbs which proved quite energizing for some of us who got ill, probably because of the many flies around. But, it was altogether a memorable stay. Many thanks to Sachin for organizing everything.",Raju V,/Profile/RajuV129,,50
uttarkashi,"We organised the trip through Sachin (their cousin in Mumbai) and stayed for three nights. The homestay is a solid day's drive from Dehradun which was organised for us, and was super cheap. Totally an amazing place to stay, with beautiful views and wonderfully clean air. And Kalma's cooking was delicious and filling! Balbir had such great knowledge about the local plant life too which was interesting. It was just real nice! They are really friendly and welcoming. And it was no real bother going in the winter, although it was cold they set us up with plenty of bedding. They also took us round on walks and introduced us to their family, and gave us the chance to get involved with all sorts of trips and whatnot had we had the time. A lovely quiet place, it was a good way to see",kwbr,/Profile/kwbr,"Manchester, United Kingdom",50
uttarkashi,"I first visited Balbir's village in 2010. Him and his wife and his kids met me at their house with smiles and affection. I was going to stay for 3 days, I ended up staying for 2 weeks and coming back 3 more times over the past 6 years. The uniqueness of this homestay is not its gorgeous location - at the portal to the Har-ki-Dun glacier, or the pahadi food that energizes both body and soul, but it is the engagement and love that Balbir's family bestows on all tourists that come to their house. Furthermore, their gorgeous cedar/pine house, with solar lamps that come out at night, is comfortable and idyllic.   Looking over their old ledgers I discovered that they have entertained people from 10 different countries, have kept in touch with many of them even after the stay ended and",Brownmountainman,/Profile/Brownmountainman,"Madison, Wisconsin",50

uttarkashi,"The homestay is a short 5mins walk from Sankri. You stay with Sachin's family Balbur and Camla. They place, area, scenery and vibe is amazing. You will not regret staying here vs in Sankri town itself. The best food I had during my travels in India was made at the homestay...organic, healthy and delicious!! Comfy room, bathroom and enough blankets for the cold winter nights. The family is amazing. Balbir will take you for nature walks, show you around his farm and share deep discussions about life. Most definitely a place I would recommend. ",_triecha_111,/Profile/_triecha_111,South Africa,50
uttarkashi,"Amazing Himalaya, Perfect homestay !  Great Experience!  It’s an unforgettable, amazing experience for us while to be at this place and staying with the Family. I visited this beautiful place in October2015 with my wife It was such nice experience to stay in this true Himalayan village see the local life here,  Rawat Family where we stayed is so kind and caring that it was kind of second home for us in Himalaya. It was such great and warm feeling to be a part of the nature and the community. The view of Himalayan peaks from the house are mind blowing. The food here excellent. Its vegeterian, most of the ingredients from their own farms which are around on the steps of mountain, organic and cooked on firewood.

uttarkashi,"This place is exactly what has been described on the airbnb site and what Sachin mentioned over our numerous discussions. He was pro-active in his approach to understand my requirements and help arrange for local guides etc. He went in detail of what route to take and where to halt etc. and ensured that I have a wonderful and cherishing memory of this trip right from starting point. The stay was wonderful, especially keeping in mind that this was my 1st true homestay experience. This place is a paradise for someone who wants to spend time with nature. There are options of short and long treks, visiting villages and meeting locals. Overall, a very satisfying trip for me and I have already decided to come back.
