uttarkashi,The room here was very spacious and clean. It had two balconies with a very great view of snow clad mountains. The bathroom fittings and taps were missing. There was no hot water supply. We had to pay for every bucket of hot water we asked for. The food was very good and piping hot. ,Aditi C,/Profile/921aditic,"Mumbai, India",30
uttarkashi,"Generally travelers do not prefer to stay in Gangotri and gets back to Uttar Kashi, in case you want to stay there and explore the place more the guest house from Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam is definitely a good choice. The Room service is good and staffs are well behaved, rooms are neat and clean.",Suvabrata M,/Profile/SuvabrataM2,,40
