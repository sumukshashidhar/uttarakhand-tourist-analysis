uttarkashi,"We had stayed in this hotel in the month of May.  Its a very basic hotel.  They don't know what is hospitality.  Food is also very basic.  Their sale manager don't know how to talk to people.  Our refund amount of food which we had not taken during stay in spite of payment made in advance for which they have agreed to pay in writing is still not given by them instead of so many request.  Now they are saying we will not pay it, do whatever you want to do.  They are very arrogant people and takes benefit of our helplessness.  Try to avoid to stay in this hotel.  There are lot of good options nearby in the same cost.",NilamMandlik,/Profile/NilamMandlik,"Pune, India",10
