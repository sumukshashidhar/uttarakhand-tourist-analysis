uttarkashi,"Lyers, cheaters and thieves own this hotel......I urge any wary foreigners and trekkers to avoid this hotel at all cost. I had a dreadful experience staying at this hotel. All travellers beware of the father son duo of Pradeep Rawat and the son Prashant Rawat. These people co hersed and fooled me into becoming involved in the tourism industry in Sankri. False promises and lies is what you will get from these people. They will befriend you with the sole purpose of cheating and stealing from you. In Particular beware and avoid at all costs the son Prashant who operates under the alias of The Snow Leopard which the Rat would be a more suitable name. The kindest thing I can say about Prashant is he is a parasite. He will cheat lie and steal from you at any opportunity. He will be",jamie pearce,/Profile/justcolour,"Adelaide, Australia",10
uttarkashi,"We went on the Kedarkantha trek in November and stayed at the Wild Orchid Inn at Sankri. Sankri is the base for treks like the Kedarkantha trek, Har-ki-dun trek and the Bali Pass trek.  Rooms were clean and neat. Bathrooms were top class. New fittings. Geyser which provided piping hot water in minutes.  They have rooms with two-beds and three-beds. The rooms with the three beds provide spectacular views of the snow capped mountains and the deep valley with the river roaring at the bottom.   The owner and staff are very helpful, friendly and efficient.  Highly recommended.",gangolli,/Profile/gangolli,"Mysuru (Mysore), India",50
uttarkashi,"I have stayed here a couple of times since Sankri is the base village for a number of treks. The sheets and the rooms are quite clean here. Hot water supply is an added bonus. The balcony on the rear side has an excellent view. Food is mostly available in one of the nearby dhabas, though occasionally the Hotel's kitchen is opened. In peak seasons, this place is bustling with trekkers.",Arnab Das,/Profile/ArnabD1000,"Dehradun, India",40
uttarkashi,"It is literally a transit camp for trekkers.  The location being remote it is a decent accommodation.  The views from some rooms are very good. Basic amenities provided, clean rooms.  Co-operative staff.  Hot water subject to number of inmates.",vidyavathi,/Profile/vidyavathi,"Bengaluru, India",40
uttarkashi,"I stayed here for a day while returning from har ki dun trek in December 2015.   It is located at the end of the 100 meter long Sankri main market. Given how remote Sankri Village is, the smallest of luxuries matter, especially when other places don't have them.  Firstly, the mattress and blanket here were better than the other 2 hotels i sampled here so a big positive for night sleep. Secondly, the solar water heater provided us excellent water for bathing. Finally it's a new property so stuff worked in the bathroom. Might seem like i have low standards, but again, given how remote and small this village is (it's inside a national park) this is as much as you can expect.   I could say the view was nice, but you'd be better off wandering out of your room to get even better",adi0202,/Profile/adi0202,United Kingdom,40
