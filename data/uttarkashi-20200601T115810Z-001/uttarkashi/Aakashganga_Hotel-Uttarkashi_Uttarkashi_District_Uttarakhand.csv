uttarkashi,"I was on a Char Dham trip with my parents and took two nights halt at this hotel. The Rooms gives a modern feel with nice and clean washrooms. Though everything seemed good until we enter and requested for lunch. To my surprise, they don't provide lunch. Seems the hotel is only for fixed menu dinner buffet and breakfast. The Kitchen and restaurant really need renovation and cleaning. There were flies all over. The Service was also not good. Any request that you make would be denied in first place and then they agree (if you start screaming) and take lot of time to provide. Overall an average hotel.",Mohit Bansal,/Profile/MohitB857,"Greater Noida, India",30
uttarkashi,"Aakash Ganga Hotel is located near the main Gangotri Road about 2 km south of Uttarkashi city center.  Views overlook mountains, terraced fields and a small village.  Easy access to town and just far away enough to have a peaceful stay.  I ended up staying a week in this well-maintained, clean new hotel. It has light-filled spacious rooms, wifi, room service, restaurant and a kind, helpful owner and staff.  Highly recommended.",242cara,/Profile/242cara,"West Palm Beach, Florida",50
