uttarkashi,"We were a group of 12 family members on a trip to Gangotri and Badrinath. We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights. The hotel was severely understaffed when we visited - there were a total of 2 (year TWO!) staff members. 1 guy was doubling up as the room boy and the receptionist, and 1 more person who was acting as the chef. Rooms were just OK, but the TVs were not working because they had not paid the subscription fees. The rooms have a good view of the river, there is a nice road bridge across the river which is accessible from the hotel. The hotel is outside the town, but there is a nearby shop which sells some essentials like water, cold drinks, snacks, etc. It seems like they run a Yoga Centre, but that is probably during the season, there was nothing of the sort when we visited.",ToffeeTour,/Profile/ToffeeTour,"Bengaluru, India",30

uttarkashi,I stayed during my Chardham Yatra session. Many people have many views but in holistic mountain it is great experience to live beside Ganga Ji ..specially when you get chance to do Aarti in this premises on request.

Opened on May, 1 and on May 5,  we were the sixth guest in 18 room hotel in 5 days.  We have been cheated by our tour operator while booking of this hotel, as numerous things were told and it was just like an Rs 7-800/- hotel   while we have been charged Rs 3400/- for a night.  Not even basic things like soap, intercom, toiletries are provided which you expect in such price.  Always, hotel staff has only one answer,  this is new hotel and very soon it would done.

The photos published in TripAdvisor is completely deceiving & the reality doesn't even come anyway close to it. The manager does his best to impress you with his oratory skills but I'm afraid same effort is not seen in maintaining the Resort. The hygiene has absolutely no place here.

uttarkashi,Calling this Property a RESORT is a sure shot blunder.  It's just a Lodge with a Dining Hall & Attached Kitchen.  The location of the property on a river bank may be an attraction (but such locations are available across Uttarkhand everywhere) for people who have their own vehicle at disposal for others it is a punishment as it is very far from the town.  During my visit to hotel in 1st week of Sept 16 - my arrival / reservation was not intimated in advance to the ONLY 1 PERSON in the hotel who is managing all the 20 plus odd rooms of the hotel & kitchen. There is no one to even clean the toilets and rooms during my 2 night stay in the Hotel. The only 1 person in the Hotel will cook and acts as a caretaker of the hotel.

uttarkashi,"I was at the mot romantic destination of the world the Shivparivar Resort, with freshness of the kind never to be experienced elsewhere. The people were hospitable, despite of the Uttrakhand rain devastation they have managed to keep the place in healthy condition and this was clean and comfortable. The food was simple as we were in the Nature so the idea to breath fresh was the main concern.The honesty of the staff was so visible that it made me write the comment hey we all must travel to such a destination and not haggle for room rates. The cost of 2 pizzas and nothing more we got a stay with attached toilet & kitchen service. The government should have subsidised the electricity bills to promote tourism but who cares.

uttarkashi,"I stayed here for 3 nights, end of June 2016. The tourist season was almost over, so we were the only occupants when we checked in. Positives: 1. Great location, on the banks of river Bhagirathi. You can spend hours just looking at the river flowing by and listening to its roaring sound. You can also go down and sit on rocks in the middle of river. Location is one of the best you can get in Uttarkashi, if you like serenity and picturesque location. Being out of main town, you would need to have your own transport to commute, though. 2. Decently appointed rooms by Uttarkashi standards 3. Attentive staff. Shalabh and team are great folks and try to make you comfortable to the best of their ability.  What let's the whole experience down is the food, which lacks taste.

uttarkashi,"the place is a little run down. very run down, actually. the stairwell has no rood and the restaurant gets wet if it rains :) food is okay, but not because of lack of effort. the staff (shiv, shalabh and team) try their best, but they just aren't the best chefs in the world.  the location is really good. the staff is really nice and try to please at every opportunity. so just for that i'd give them 4 *s. we were the only occupants at that time, and maybe that got us more attention. overall we were happy with our 2 night stay, and i'd stay here again if i go back to uttarkashi.",dunkin007,/Profile/dunkin007,"Visakhapatnam (Vizag), India",40
uttarkashi,"The hotel is located at the bank of The River and that's the most amazing part of it. Story finishes here. The hotel has got rooms, which are just ok. It's a basic hotel when it comes to sleep. Do not expect any other service. The food is not good. Please have a backup plan.  Unfortunately, this is probably the only reasonable option you have in uttarkashi for overnight stay. That's the reason, we stayed there for two nights. On the second evening, we brought our own milk and supplies. The master of the hotel was kind enough to allow access to the kitchen and we ourselves have cooked our own meal, with the help of their staff, of-course.

The place is great if you have your own vehicle or a reserved one - not so great if you are travelling by public transport and have luggage. However you can take the phone numbers of the local taxi drivers at Uttarkashi town and call them which should solve the matter.
