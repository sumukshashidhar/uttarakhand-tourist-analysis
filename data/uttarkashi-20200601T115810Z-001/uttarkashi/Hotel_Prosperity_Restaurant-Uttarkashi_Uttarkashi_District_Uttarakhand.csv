uttarkashi,"We stayed 2 nights in May 2019. No cleanliness is maintained in the rooms, hospitality is poor, staff is untrained. In addition to this kitchen facility is absolutely unhygienic and no service is provided. Free breakfast was given only poha and tea.",RajendarSinghal,/Profile/rajendarsinghal51,"Panjim, India",10
uttarkashi,"Free breakfast-was given only one sandwich No 24 hr staff at reception Left morning at 6am , nobody was there to collect the room keys at the reception Left the keys on the counter. When returned at 6.15p.m  in the evening, again nobody at the counter, astonished to see that room was not at all cleaned, when Enquired with the person who then came at the counter he said ""You people did not tell us that the room has to be cleaned"" We replied that room cleaning is obligatory and goes without saying , that this is the first hotel making such a demand. Further When we said nobody was at the counter/ reception at 6am  he said he does not be there And how can we expect somebody to be there at that time  When I asked whether the hotel has a license to run as hotel he told me if you want",Ravi N,/Profile/7ravin,,10
