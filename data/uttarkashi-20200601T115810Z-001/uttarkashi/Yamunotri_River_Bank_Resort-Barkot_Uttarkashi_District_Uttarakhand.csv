uttarkashi,"Camps are clearly better vis-a-vis hotels in this area. Camps are clean, toilet hygenic and service is good. Food is normal but hygenic. All in all, a good place to stay and travel to yamunotri. One of the better options available to stay in Barkot.",Devendra G,/Profile/749devendrag,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30

uttarkashi,"On our way journey to Char Dham Yatra, we only booked a hotel/resort 3-4 hours in prior as you can never predict the road status. On our first day We booked this hotel and it turned out to be the best one with comfortable tent, soothing river sound and great view, especially when you wake up in the morning. Prices are very reasonable, and staff are helpful. Breakfast could have been better, but everything worked well, and I can hardly complain given the price. *WORTH A STAY*",Utkarsh T,/Profile/899utkarsht,"Mumbai, India",50

uttarkashi,"Stayed with parents on the way to char dham yatra in the middle of Sept for two nights. The camp is located about 12 kms from Barkot on the way to Yamunotri right at the banks of mother Yamuna. Its an ideal stopover if you are a nature lover. Of course, the 2013 floods have casted its shadow everywhere in the char dham area of Uttarakhand. The staff is great. One point contact is Mr Pramod the manager of the property. Comes with solutions all the time to make the stay memorable. Food is superb just like home.Tents are neat and clean with western toilet attached. Power back up facility and solar water heating system is installed in the property. The property is safe to stay. There is a very old pond of mother Ganga water about 70 mtrs. The place derives its name from it,",Kaustubh J,/Profile/60kaustubhj,"Zug, Switzerland",40
uttarkashi,"The best part is the scenery and location of camp. It is close to barkot (nearest place to yamunotri) and yamunotri is just 1 hr drive from here. Staff is hospitable.Food is good (nothing fancy but good home food). Camps are clean, toilets are OK.But the best part is it is on the banks on river yamuna and you can get the see the peak of yamunotri glacier.Price is fine and you can bargain if you want.",Himanshu_Shruti,/Profile/Himanshu_Shruti,"Bengaluru, India",40
uttarkashi,if you are travelling to this part of the world this is a place to stay. --- the best location in uttarakhand I can say.- bang on the Yamuna river- with a view of the great Himalayas. --   The stay was during my travel to char dham last year. yes you might miss the five star services but the staff though not very professional but is very courteous.,amitwantstoexplore,/Profile/amitwantstoexplore,"New Delhi, India",50

uttarkashi,"This is definitely one of a kind lodging in the whole of Uttarakhand. The location is absolutely spot on and brilliantly set. Its located right on the banks of the crystal clear Yamuna river and is surrounded by wonderful and picturesque valleys. The rooms are clean and well maintained, just what you'd expect in a good tent. There is a proper attached bathroom and hot water supply. The food is delicious and there is a wide array of choice. But the brownie points goes to its wonderful staff who were well behaved, courteous and took care of every little demands we put forth dutifully. Also, its just a stone throw away from a famous Tapt kund which is very well known for its purity and importance. Would advise a stay here if going to Yamunotri as it is located in close proximity",Akshat Jhunjhunwala,/Profile/akshatjjw,"Mumbai, India",50
uttarkashi,we had a wonderful stay at the river banks. The environment was serene and we were completely spellbound. The cook was extremely good.
