There are number of apple trees within the guest house compound. Scenic beauty of place is very attractive. Quality is food is simply fantastic. Mr Sunder is a very nice person who took care of us very well. We enjoyed our stay wonderfully. I strongly vouch this guest house for stay.",Kaushik Kumar Das,/Profile/kaushikdas77777,"Kolkata, India",50
uttarkashi,My family travelled to harsil for a 3d-2n stay at sunder homestay and we were blessed with snowfall on our arrival. The bhagirathi valley is enchanting in its beauty complimented by great hospitality and service provided to us by Mr. Sunder and his staff. From bonfires to freshly cooked food our stay really felt like a home stay. I would highly recommend people travelling to harsil to stay at Sunder homestay as it really surpassed all my expectations. Location - excellent Hospitality - excellent Food & services - very good.  Will visit again soon.,Priyam Swarup,/Profile/Priyam369369,"New Delhi, India",50
