uttarkashi,"This was our base camp for Dayara Bugyal trek. We were a group of 20 people. They have a few 4 bed rooms, 3 bed rooms and a 6-8 people dormitory. The rooms are average and toilets are not very clean. The 4 bed room that we stayed in had a problem with the geyser. Hence they provided us with a heating rod for hot water. The food served by the staff is good. On the request of our trek guide they even baked a delicious cake for one of the kids in our group to celebrate his birthday. However the entire dining area is swarming with flies.",prit_12,/Profile/prit_12,"Pune, India",30
uttarkashi,"Stayed here for a night . It was kind of base camp for us while trekking to dayara bugyal. This place is filthy. Dirty linen in rooms, broken chairs and bees in dining room, broken toilet seats in washrooms and seepage on walls. It completely spoiled our mood on the first day of trip itself. This place really needs maintenance.",renu m,/Profile/510renum,,10
uttarkashi,It was a great stay arranged by Garhwal Mandal for hikers in Raithal. This place is like a base camp for Dayara bugyal trek. You can book here via online booking or you book at the location. Food is also provided by the care taker.,Sumit Sharma | Indian Travel Blogger,/Profile/iamsumitsharma,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
