uttarkashi,"This place is right on the banks of mighty Yamuna around 7kms ahead of small town called Barkot. This is the best part of this camp, river is shallow and fast flowing, come prepared with quick dry clothes to take a dip in this holy river. This place offers, tents and semi-permanent structure, don’t expect too much. Well clean bed, pedestal fan, electricity connection, paid home cooked simple food (Rice, Dal, Chapatti, two Veg, Papad) and clean bathroom with western seat. Believe me, this is perhaps the only option available on this route if you want to hop on, while travelling to Yamonotri. I started travelling from Dehradun @ 4:30 and decided to hop on route as reaching till Yamonotri was not possible. While passing through Barkot town I looked at hotel, god’s sake looks like",AvinashM,/Profile/AvinashM,"Mumbai, India",30

uttarkashi,"We reached Dehradun by Shatabdi,late by one hour,took cab, started journey to Barkot, reached at 6.15 pm,given the rooms,part tent part rooms,roof was tinned.Rooms were small to tiny. Washroom was the worst part,tiny wash basin,if you touch ,it is in your hands.Commode was the same.The drainage tube is out,we had to negotiate ourselves.No place to open the suitcase,no place to put your toiletries .It was a nightmare to live there.The owner lives in Delhi,Mr.Bhandari. I booked on booking.com,as the pictures were incredible,and of course  location is good, food was also good. River Yamuna was there. Whole night it rained and it was making noise on tin shade,so unable to sleep. We found the accommodation overpriced,as facilities were poor .",jyotsna,/Profile/jyotsna907,"New Delhi, India",30
