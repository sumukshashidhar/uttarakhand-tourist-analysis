uttarkashi,This is not a hotel. This is a lodge. Poor dirty pathetic. Water problem. Bathroom leakage. Food shortage. Power cut. Only fit for the villagers who have to spend a night anyhow. Better to stay in a home stay ,Nirantar Singh,/Profile/shabdnirantar,"Ranchi, India",10
uttarkashi,We booked this hotel online three months prior to visit and yet they flatly refused saying we had no booking in their hotel. After so many calls and arguments we got a room. The room was right on the road. The curtains were transparent. No privacy. No hot water on first day in spite of showing availability. They wouldn't give the valley view rooms even though almost all of them were vacant. The toilet seat was broken. The food and room service was the only good thing. Not recommended. ,Aditi C,/Profile/921aditic,"Mumbai, India",20
