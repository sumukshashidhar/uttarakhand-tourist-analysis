uttarkashi,"Found the room cheap at last minute returning late night from Gangotri. Its in a 2 min walk distance from shared pvt taxi stand to travel Gangotri/Rishikesh, Kashi Vishvanath temple and 5 mins walk from Bus Stand.Food is cheap and good enough. One does not need AC at night so no AC rooms though. 90% hotels here are non-AC. For fly by morning hectic Char Dham tours and night stop overs this is sufficient and good choice.",Vikas B,/Profile/VikasB655,,50
