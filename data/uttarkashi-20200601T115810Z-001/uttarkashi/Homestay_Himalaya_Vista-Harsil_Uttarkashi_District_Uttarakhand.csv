uttarkashi,"We arrived here by car from Uttarkashi.  Its easy to find - on the main Uttarkashi-Gangotri Road.  We were doing our Char Dham pilgrimage and had thought of staying in Gangotri but heard terrible things about the accommodation and food there, so we tried this place nearby.  It's pathway entrance is just across from Harsil.  You climb up to it through a virgin deodar forest, but they carry all your stuff. The location in a tiny settlement is spectacular with views of the Ganges, the valley, and the high Himalaya.  The Ultimate Peacefull Paradise.  The house is very new and spotless.  The quiet pleasant  Negi family lives in an attached house so they are there to answer any questions or needs.  Mr. Negi operates what is said to be the best trekking company in the area, so guidance",jeffrey n,/Profile/jeffreyn544,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",50
uttarkashi,"We stayed in the month of May in Homestay Himalaya Vista.  The scenery was beautiful. To reach there you go through a beautiful forest in the hills above the gangotri road. It is not a long trek, only 1.5kms. However after the drive from Uttarkashi, the trek is welcome change. The standing and walking muscles wake up.   About 30mins of walking later, we come out to a village and after a flight of cobbled steps, we can view harsil from high above, the Gangotri turning a bend towards the hot and dusty plains.    The homestay run by Mr. Rajesh Negi is beautiful. There are many opportunities for bird watching and walking trails of all levels of difficulty.  The food was very nice with fresh homegrown Rajma.  Mr. Rajesh himself is a very accomplished trekking guide, is very friendly,",Narayanaswamy N S,/Profile/NarayanaswamyNS,,50
