uttarkashi,"I travelled to Harsil- Dharali soon after Diwali in November 2019, when the tourist season is over (char dham yatra) and the temperature starts to plummet but the roads are still drive worthy. The journey, no doubt, was tiring (due to road works) and prolonged (due to our several short stopovers to admire the sheer beauty of our surroundings) but our respite was a dip in the hot water spring at Gangnani and our prize was our stay at Prakriti- The Retreat.¬† ‚Ä®On reaching Prakriti we received a warm welcome by the staff and were pleased to find ourselves in a tastefully decorated reception, leisure and dining area. We checked into a spacious river facing room number 301. We quickly unpacked and headed straight to the restaurant to enjoy a hot cuppa with mixed vegetables fritters",Prash K,/Profile/prash123,England,50
uttarkashi,"The Prakriti s a real gem! The view from the outside is not particularly inviting, but on stepping through the main doors, you are immediately struck by the beautiful, wooden reception area. Light and airy, and very spacious - very welcoming. The straff throughout the hotel were very friendly and extremely helpful. The breakfasts and dinner were amazing, a wonderful selection, and again, the young staff were very efficient and helpful in making the breakfast times enjoyable. The location of the hotel is great - right in the middle of beautiful nature, The room we had was very spacious and well equipped with all essentials.

uttarkashi,"We stayed at Prakriti for 3 nights recently and were pleasantly surprised with the hotel quality. Given that this is a far flung mountain area, the facilities are basic but thoughtful. Our senior citizen parents were offered room on the ground floor, while we stayed on the floor above. Both rooms had river view and it was breathtaking. Food was great too... We opted for Garhwali thali and thoroughly enjoyed it at dinner. Do note that electricity supply is very erratic so be prepared... But it wasn't really missed as lamps were provided for the night and we didnt travel all the way to the Himalayas to watch cable TV. All in all a place totally worth the price.

uttarkashi,The location of the hotel on the banks of the Bhagirathi and surrounded by mountains is stunning. Places such as Gangotri and Nelong valley are 1-2 hours away. Rooms are clean and the service is decent. The food served is primarily North Indian and they also prepared a very good Garhwali meal on request. Power cuts are frequent and the generator is put on for a few hours during power cuts and not for the entire duration of the power cut. This is understandable given that fuel for the generator has to be sourced from a distant place (no fuel stations nearby) but can be a bit a dampener for guests.,ArnabAtBlr,/Profile/ArnabAtBlr,"Bengaluru, India",40

But due to it location it is completely dependent on supplies from Uttrakashi city which is 70 Km away. The hotel ran out of tea bags when we stayed there. So the staff must do advance planning for all supplies depending on reservations.   You can enjoy leisurely walks around the hotel or just enjoy quietly on the banks of river.

uttarkashi,"My wife and myself stayed at Prakriti during our Chardham tour in 3rd week of May 2016. It was a blessing in disguise. We had our booking confirmed at Chardham Camp, Harsil through Make My Trip. But, due to over booking by Chardham Camp management, we were alloted a room at Prakriti about 2 kms away, which was newly constructed and some work was still going on. Initially, we felt a little lonely, but a few more moved in from Chardham camp by evening. We loved our stay at Prakriti. Room was spacious, was neat & clean with hot water supply in the bathroom. Best part was the closeness to the nature, with river Bhagirati flowing just outside the hotel boundary wall and the view of green as well as snow capped mountains from our room window. It was nice to sit in the balcony and",Santu18,/Profile/Santu18,"Mumbai, India",40
