uttarkashi,"When we  reached the resort it was 8 pm naturally dark after 11 hours of journey from Haridwar . It was raining before and the ground was wet.After calling the security two three times somebody  came and opened the temporary gate .As we got down from car we felt cold tremendously . The resort located within 1 KM of Janaki Cotti through short cut and 2 KM by road. . Tomar Singh is a local and care taker of the resort . First question I asked him ,about hot water . He assured me that there is a geyser . My first problem is solved ..Our room was spacious  . Had enough blanket to negotiate cold. Resort served roti and rice with vegetablesfor dinner.  . Next morning we are due for Yamunotri  darshan . Tomar Singh ensured two horses in the morning 0530..Whatever anguish I had in the",Tapanmc,/Profile/Tapanmc,"Chittagong City, Bangladesh",40

uttarkashi,"We were welcomed by the warm hotel staff. They were just amazing in hospitality that shows in India, good hospitality can not be learned in colleges it should be learned by this culture, people. Amazing scenic views. Stay, food was just awesome. Staff fulfilled our all wishes before time. Staff is kind respectful and fast in service.  I felt the stay was definitely homely.  I cant forget the campfire and conversation of trekking knowledge, apple trees, rare medicinal tree plantation in his garden. The person has inspired us a lot.",vrushali101,/Profile/vrushali101,,40

uttarkashi,"I had made a call before I booked this place and asked them many questions about the hotel... Thank god we booked this place which is little bit outside of Yamunotri because in the Yamunotri area all the other hotels are very basic and so crowded can't even say about the hygiene...  I am saying this because when we went for our Darshan to Yamunotri I looked at the Lodges and hotels on the way and they were so not happening... This is kind of a small Resort which is about 2 kilometres on the other side of the area where mostly people start their journey towards Yamunotri ...it is owned by a family with two sons husband and wife, they have been living there since years and years and they have made a portion of the property into a hotel I did have to climb 2 steps to get to my room",wheelchairandeye,/Profile/Pammu_Parvinder,"Mumbai, India",50
