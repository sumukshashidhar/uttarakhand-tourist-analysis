uttarkashi,"I have been here for almost 4 or 5 times while going for a trek to Har Ki Dun & Kedarkantha. So I have not stayed here but have been to the restaurant and the service + food is okay considering Purola as a small town. The view from the restaurant is of the main market and you can get everything just outside this place. The washrooms are not very clean but just can be considered as per the situation. There are very few small Dhaba type options for food nearby, hence this is the only option most of the people would consider. Most of the adventure companies, stop at this hotel/ restaurant only for meals.",Shubha K,/Profile/Shubs24,"Pune, India",40
uttarkashi,It was such a bad experience of my life. I stayed in hotel in second week of July. The behavior of the hotel owner was horrible he was acting like a local gunda. He misbehaved to our all team in a very bad manner. The quality of food was very poor so we preferred to have food outside. AC room size is very small. Major part is security issue over there. I would not recommend to anyone to stay there.,Nadeem C,/Profile/NadeemC44,,10
uttarkashi,"We stopped here for breakfast on our way from Dehradun to Sankri. It took about 3 hours and 45 minutes to reach this place, that was a perfect timing for breakfast; given that we left Doon at about 5am.The bathroom was reasonably clean. The restaurant is in the first floor. The parathas were great, particularly the onion parathas, but was too oily. We didn't stay here overnight, however the rooms looked okay for a short stay.

uttarkashi,"A nice facility was required for travelers planing to explore the Dehradun- Hatkoti-Shimla connection and also Har Ki Doon area, Hotel Classic Hill View fulfills that requirement. Now trekkers can even start their return journey in the afternoon  from Sankri and stay overnight at this facility to reduce the travelling hours next day. Else Purola is turning into a shanty town and there are no facilities beyong Purola till you reach Sankri or Hatkoti. The rooms were clean and small, perfect for overnight stay. The house keeping needs professional inputs. There was a used satchel of hair oil   left in front of the mirror, and color of towels were different in the two rooms booked by us. The quality was cheap. They can save lot of money by using less oil in cooking  Else food was",Mountain_Shepherds,/Profile/Mountain_Shepherds,"Auli, India",40
uttarkashi,"1. In purola - this is one of the better hotels 2. Right inside the city 3. Warm people at the hotel 4. Fairly clean place 5. The following must improve a. While the lunch/dinner etc are are fine, the Breakfast needs to dramatically improve with less oily, less spicy options with a lot of fruits b. In some rooms, the passage near the bathroom has an opening with the general area and i just could not speel well since people started making noise at 5 am  c. During my stay, i witnessed too many flies around the reception and kitchen area - must solve this problem",dkr50,/Profile/dkr50,"Bengaluru, India",30
