uttarkashi,"Stayed at this lovely hotel just by chance, for 2 nights in Sep 2017, during visit to Yamunotri as part of Chardham trip. Due to major landslides near Sayanachatti blocking the  road to Hotel Anil at Ranachatti, where our actual booking was done, we were offered alternative accommodation at this hotel.
