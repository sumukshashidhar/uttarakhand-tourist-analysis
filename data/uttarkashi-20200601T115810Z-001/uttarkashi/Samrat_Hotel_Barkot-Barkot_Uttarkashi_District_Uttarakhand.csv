uttarkashi,Tiny Hotel. Food is homely. Hot water is an issue and is available in selected time in the morning and evening. The rooms with one tiny window and ventilation is very poor. It is very difficult to stay in hot summer at this Hotel. We went during rainy season so less problem. Good view of Yamuna river from the terrace of this Hotel. Yamunotri is 2 hour drive from here ,Venkateswar,/Profile/Venkateswar,"Navi Mumbai, India",30
uttarkashi,"Basic Hotel which generally tourist use to stay on the way to Yamunotri. Has basic kitchen facilities, rooms are average, staff is average. Due to local challenges, you could experience, electricity issues. But if you have just have to spend a night, not a bad choice",Ketan27,/Profile/Ketan27,"Thane, India",30
