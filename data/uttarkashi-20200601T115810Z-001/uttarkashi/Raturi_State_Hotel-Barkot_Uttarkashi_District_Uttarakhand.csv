uttarkashi,"Room smelled like it wasnâ€™t cleaned in ages. Staff is extremely rude and try to extort money in different ways. We just kept our bags in the lobby for 10min and had to pay for the full day. He got aggressive and was demanding money just to coz we stepped into the property. Do not stay here. No security,no amenities and the hotel smells like anything.",A917p,/Profile/A917p,,10
