uttarkashi,"To spend one night in a recently refurbished hotel with modern decor and a fresh coat of paint is gladly welcome and that‚Äôs exactly what we experienced at GMVN,Uttarkashi.The rooms have been renovated with cozy and comfy furnitures which gave us the  necessary rest and relaxation after a 7 hr. journey from Rishikesh.The cost of delux room is 2500 bucks approx,slightly on the higher side but acceptable.Make sure to book in advance through the GMVN website to avoid the heavy rush of the Yatra Season. As always the TRH is located in close proximity to the main road and the Ganges flows eternally nearby.A evening visit to the ancient Vishwanath temple is a must and you get to know about the rich history of this ancient small town of Uttarkashi from the informative Pujaris,just",Soutik H,/Profile/soutikh2015,"Kolkata, India",50

uttarkashi,"We started our chardham journey from Rishikesh organised by Garhwal mandal Vikas Nigam Ltd. Special mention needs to be done of RM TRH Uttarkashi, Mr. Kamal Nautiyal, his restaurant manager and all his support staff. My child got ill during the journey, he extended all his support, help and guidance for arranging doctor, extended accomodation, arranging transport and other requirements. He was very kind and supportive.  I am very glad for his kind gesture and wish him luck for his future.",adityaagwl,/Profile/adityaagwl,,50

uttarkashi,"As ever GMVN managed transit guest houses at major tourist destinations in UK are well managed ,with good ambience and good food. Same is here. The rooms are very reasonably priced . Uttarkashi is a small town with a couple of good temples like Kashi Vishwanath temple. We were coming from Gangotri and stayed here for the night .

uttarkashi,We ended up spending much more time in Uttarkashi than we originally planned so we were definitely on the lookout for clean food. We went to the GMVN restaurant and then proceeded to eat there every meal. Best restaurant we found as travelers in Uttarkashi,kelseyhigney,/Profile/kelseyhigney,"Rudra Prayag, India",50
uttarkashi,We booked this for our chardham trip. Its a good hotel for a one night stopover. Excellent location - very close to Bhagirathi river one could literally walk to the river. Also very close to Vishwanath temple - about 10-15 mins leisurely walkto the temple and the market area. The hotel itself is very old looking and lots of renovation going on when we went. Rooms are big in size but old looking. At this price there are other options. Avoidable food.,Hits,/Profile/hitanshs,"London, United Kingdom",20
uttarkashi,"We stopped here once for lunch and another time for overnight stay. Close to Bhagirathi River, Vishwanath temple and the quaint market of narrow lanes.  Big renovation is on so there is dust and noise. May be the ambience will be better after renovation. Rooms need more attention. Restaurant and food were good but there was no water in the wash basin. Needs attention here too.",Travel3652,/Profile/Travel3652,"Guwahati, India",30
uttarkashi,Stayed here as part of chardham yatra. Place is comparatively large and averagely maintained. Staff is mostly experienced one  so they can guide you fairly if you require.  Rooms are large but screaming for restoration so are bathrooms. But for a day or two its fair enough for such low prices. Bed & linen were comfortable but nothing great. Atmosphere were pretty pleasant around that time.    Restaurant has got some limited listings on each of the order they prepare them fresh so do not expect quick service.  Location is good too.  In my view it can be a choice in the town with low expectations.,Manandani,/Profile/Manandani,"Mumbai, India",30
uttarkashi,"This is an average hotel and not very clean. We stayed here for one night. rooms were having lot of dust and not cleaned. In the early morning water was not there in the rooms and the person at reception didn't help. We found service very poor.

uttarkashi,"We stayed in this Hotel on 7th May night our way from Yamunotri to Gangotri.  Again on 10th May night, on our way from Gangotri to Guptkashi. The rooms in the new building are better than the old building.   The deluxe rooms were fairly large, good and clean.  They have a restaurant which is clean and food is also good. Dhal rajma was too good and my sons just loved it.  Mr. Semwal has arranged for our Gangotri -Gomukh trek. The Hotel Manager(I don't remember his name) was very helpfull and also gave us a lot of information about the town and also the gomukh trek.   The breakfast is complimentary and was good.  They offered butter toast, Alu Parota, Dhal, Puri Bhaji etc.",BGIP,/Profile/BGIP,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",40
uttarkashi,"Went in May end 2014 enroute to trek to Dodital and beyond. Used this place as a stop over and to park our car.  4 of us were there so we took the 4bedded rooms. A tip ensured fresh sheets , which in any case were decent. The rooms were clean, spacious and  basic . The TV worked! There was an issue with the water in the loo, which too was addressed . The bathrooms were , like all Hill properties , very basic but clean and well lit.  The reception manager was always to the point but helpful.  Overall a good experience in a happy place.",gulshan_1900,/Profile/gulshan_1900,"Mumbai, India",40
uttarkashi,I stayed at the GMVN guest house in Uttarkashi when I was part of a team that responded to the 2013 Uttarakhand Disaster. I understand this was not the best of times to be staying here but the fact that they kept the place open and running when most hotels in town had closed shop due to lack of tourists during the disaster was appreciable in itself.  The rooms are lovely - loads of space and well laid out. The bathrooms are as large and there is lots of walking space within the room. I took a non ac room but i had a look at AC rooms too. Those are wonderful.  The restaurant is nice - no non vegetarian fare but the food is nice enough. I guess i was there during a disaster so the only a few things on the menu were available. But good food all in all.  The cons - there is a,ChrisJ45,/Profile/ChrisJ45,"Ahmedabad, India",40
uttarkashi,"We were travelling from Rudraprayag to Gangotri and stayed enroute at Uttarkashi. We had bookings at another place-but it was very inconviniently located and the staff was unwelcoming, so we decided to go to GMVN. The place looked inviting, with lots of lights, spacious surroundings and was nearest to the river. We were given a large super deluxe room. True, the bathroom door creaked shut , but that was a very small inconvinience compared to the comfortable stay. The stay is very friendly and will go an extra mile to make if you feel comfortable. The food in the resturant was good. The balcony was large and we could sit and enjoy the rains (the place is filled with a wonderful woodsy smell after rains). We stayed after we returned from Gangotri too. The reception staff, helped",gauriram,/Profile/gauriram,"New Delhi, India",40
uttarkashi,we were offered super deluxe rooms. the rooms were big and clean. big enough to play soccer lol....the bathrooms were very neat the food at gmvn restaurant was very very poor compared to gmvn at other places. there was a situation where i was forced to prepare my own bread toast and poori in the kitchen. very poor man power........but uttarkashi has very good restaurants in the town if u explore deep. the main problem is there is no proper place to stay and GMVN offers excellent rooms...be it deluxe or sup. dlx.....dont go for family suites they are very poor and low in maintanence. they should have had AC rooms also atleast during summers........if u want a very cool place then there are plenty of GMVN bunglows on the way to gangotri try some of those....but in uttarkashi GMVN,A Tripadvisor Member,/Profile/null,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",50
