uttarkashi,"Camp Nirvana is around 6 km from the highway to Barkot, on the Yamunotri road. A very serene property, right on the banks of the scenic Yamuna. We were allotted a cottage with a lovely view of the river from the verandah. Comfortable room, clean Toilet, plenty of hot water. The staff went out of the way to be warm and helpful. Really enjoyed the food served - piping hot, tasty and lot of personal attention. Loved the Khichadi + Kadhi served for dinner and crisp Aloo Paranthas and porridge for breakfast. Very comfortable and enjoyable stay.",whirlwindexplorer,/Profile/whirlwindexplorer,Chennai,40
uttarkashi,"We stayed for 2 nights while visiting Yamunotri.  Swiss camp having basic amenities but there is no running hot water !!!  You have to ask for bucket of hot water in morning and wait for that..Moreover, if you are on Half Board, they are not providing afternoon Tea Coffee.. It is required..  Staff much co-operative.. Good breakfast and dinner.",FAVOURITETOURS,/Profile/FAVOURITETOURS,Rajkot,40
uttarkashi,"Stayed here from 10/12 to 10/13/18- as part of Tour group Tirtha Yathra...during Chardham visit in October 2018 nice place to stay, right in the banks of Yamuna, both Cottages and Camp tents. Very clean and well maintained. The camp has two variants.....(tent and cottage)..we Stayed in the cottage..very clean, good customer service. No hot water in wash basin...only for shower. No hot water kettle in the room, so was deproved of early morning coffee before the trek to Yamunothri. No restaurant available, no kitchen, make your own arrangements. Our tour operator had a fully equipped mobile kitchen along with us so had to make special arrangements for tea in the early hours. Recommend to stay in the place....",gkv2014,/Profile/gkv2014,"San Francisco, California",40

uttarkashi,There is no better description that I can give that when you wake up you hear the mighty Yamuna river flowing just meters away from the hotel. Do take a short walk near the river it is worth it! Living in the nature is an experience of its own so donâ€™t expect a luxurious tent but instead a very basic tent which caters to your basic need. Warm clothes are a must since the mornings can be very cold,Srishti Misra,/Profile/srishtimisra,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",40
uttarkashi,We enjoyed a wonderful stay of 2 days in camp nirvana in yumonotri.  The senic beauty around the resort along with their hospitality is really mention worthy.Inspite of too many odds resort service team always in our doorstep for any thing if we required.

uttarkashi,"Stayed in Camp Nirvana Barkot for two days in May 2018 during our Chardham Yatra, the camp is located in a very scenic spot, what with the mighty Yamuna on one side and mountains on the other. The tent provided was basic but clean. The scenary was breathtaking. Run by teenage boys who provided good service ,hot water in the morning and packed breakfast before starting for Yamunotri dham. Improvement is required in food items provided by the hotel.over all it was a good experience.",Vijaya G,/Profile/793vijayag,Hyderabad,40
uttarkashi,"It is situated on the banks of roaring Yamuna just ahead of Barkot. The tented rooms are excellent and has attached toilets. All the facilities are well maintained. The food and the service are very good. The staff is very accommodating; they gave us hot water, tea and packed breakfast early morning at 0430h so as to facilitate our pilgrimage to Yamunotri dham. They also updated us with the local conditions and rates. A must stay.",Sheshadri S,/Profile/sheshadriS,"Bengaluru, India",50
uttarkashi,It was rare experience for me to stay in a tent but overall it was great. The manager Sanju made everything perfect for us - from delicious breakfast to a wide spread for dinner. He also made sure we had hot water for bath as it was a little cold. The view was amazing and the camp rooms were decent I would say. It was clean and the beds were in good condition,rivalpine,/Profile/rivalpine,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",50
uttarkashi,"We stayed here during our Char Dham Yatra tour on end May.'17. I remember that due to a landslide, we reached here very late in the evening and it was raining also during the most part of the evening, but the reception that we got there was absolutely wonderful and full of warmth. We will never forget that hospitality.  The location is amazing, right over the banks of the sacred river Yamuna. The camps were having good basic facilities and the staffs are very helpful.",Arindom,/Profile/Arindomray,"Kolkata, India",50
uttarkashi,"Stayed here for two nights on Chardham yatra which was booked by the travel company. I really want to appreciate the owners of this tents for providing us with such a facility closest to Yamunotri. However, I have stayed in tents which are in much more isolated locations but with better conditions. A few things would lift this place from average to good or in fact very good. So please consider this as constructive feedback rather than criticism. 1. Please ensure that the tents are 100% seal proof. There are crevices & small areas exposed all around the tent inviting all kind of wild insects inside which can be scary to kids. 2. Bath rooms are simply horrible. It can be much better if focus is given on cleaning & maintenance.  3. The breakfast provided on the morning of Yamunotri",Naveen Subbaiah,/Profile/navjyo08,"Fahaheel, Kuwait",30
uttarkashi,"I stayed from May 1 to May 3, 2017 while on Chardham yatra. The camp location is excellent, but from 5 kms from Barkot on Yamnotri road, in naugaon village, and not as presently indicated in google maps. Tents are on Yamuna river bed with excellent facilities, mesmerising views, flowing river sound in night just soothing our nerves, hot water on demand, tasty and homely food, very obliging service. Manager Sanju is always available for help. Subro Bhattacharya, the GM at Delhi always obliging with guidance and help. But beware of two Camp Nirvana's in the same site. It appears the partners have split but the Subro Bhattacharya group camps have luxury and all the above mentioned facilities.",vselvarajfca,/Profile/vselvarajfca,"Coimbatore, India",50
uttarkashi,"Luxury Swiss cottage tent accommodation right on the banks of river Yamuna, gushing winds and the galloping river stream as it treads through rocks and boulders along the river bed echoes through the night under starry nights. Nirvana. That's Camp Nirvana at Barkot for you, the base camp for Yamunotri as it's called.  The camps are well maintained and eco sensitive with all modern amenities in the midst of nowhere. Dinner and breakfast are good though not much variety for choice. They serve for all guests at dining hall with the luxury of watching the only TV in the property. As such mobile connectivity is almost non existent here in mountains. Sometimes the electricity is shut down during nights as the temperatures are usually very cold and fans not required. Unless otherwise",samsamal,/Profile/samsamal,"Bengaluru, India",50
uttarkashi,"We started from Haridwar for Yamunotri and the sun was setting in west and we decided to break our journey. It was Barkot, we decided to stay in. We were searching for a place and someone suggested camps at the bank of Yamuna right after Barkot. So we drove and reached to the first camp on our left.   Amazing place and liked it at the first place. The camps were small but nice. Please do not expect any thing extra ordinary. These are nice tents for couple of nights.   The scenic beauty around is great. The river bank is little far of. The food served by the staff if just ok. The bed was comfortable and cozy. You get a table fan in the room, just in case the temperature is little high for you.   Over all the staff is quite friendly and the place scores well for base camp of",Pankaj_Bajoria,/Profile/Pankaj_Bajoria,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
uttarkashi,"OMG! The camps are situated in a very good location. There cannot be anything better. The staff is very helpful BUT.......... the hygiene and cleanliness is beyond words. Food is passable. One does not have a choice but to eat in the camp as it is in the middle of nowhere. The owners are from Delhi and could not care less as they are just interested in the moolah. The boys run the show. Most of them unkempt and dirty.   Their sense of cleanliness is completely different and distorted.  Beware, there are 2 camp Nirvana. The partners split is what one got to hear. So please make sure if you are going to 1 or 2.",Tempotraveller,/Profile/Tempotraveller,Bangalore,20

uttarkashi,"Stayed for two nights at camp nirvana in barkot on way to yamunotri. Camps are well maintained with tents nicely furnished. Staff are quite attentive and helping and do all they can to please you. Attached bathrooms are clean and hot water is provided whenever you demand. Food was good and the cooks make whatever you order. The view of river yamuna  from the camps is worth every penny.  That feeling of staying on banks of river yamuna is awesome, Although it was very very cold in November  when we stayed there .",SSR,/Profile/461snehalr,"Bhavnagar, India",40
uttarkashi,"Despite the communication misunderstanding with the arrival date , the bookings office made sure that we receive prompt consideration and were given neat and clean fully equipped camps , hot and tasteful food and Mr Hari - the caretaker ensured that we have a pleasant stay . The only drawback was that there was no route or path for direct access to the beautiful and mesmerising Yamuna river flowing within eye distance and the area of the campsite too was very small with not very lavish landscaping done . Apart from that it was a good experience but there is more need for improvement to make the stay more wholesome",vaishaligoyal,/Profile/vaishaligoyal,agra,30
uttarkashi,"Stayed here for couple of nights on our way to Yamunotri. Staff were very courteous, food was good and tents were very clean. Children were expecting a television in the tent, but it was not there, however there was a common television at the dining hall. I actually liked that there was no television on the room. The tents are walking distance from the river Yamana, but please make sure to check before you venture on your own with kids. Water will be cold and the river is not very easily accessible for city dwellers. All tents were of the same size and so we squeezed together in one tent instead of two for a family of four. It would have been good to have larger sized tents for families. Nevertheless, enjoyed the stay, the food and the location. Would not mind staying there",Sundaresan Subramanyan,/Profile/SundaresanS,"Chennai, India",40
uttarkashi,"Was here for the night halt on the way to Yamnotri in end April 2015, actually its around 2 hours journey more to Yamnotri, and the tour organizers booked this place. First impression was not so pleasant, was the only occupants since Char Dam season just started. Was below the main road on the banks of Yamuna River. Plenty of insects flying around. I didnt like carpets on hotel room floors since it collects dust and also stains are stubborn to be removed. Same case here. Luckily i brought my bedrooms sleepers. The loud flow of the river just relaxes the mind. Hot water in buckets are provided at requested time. Breakfast and dinner provided was fabulous. And the staffs were in their best selves. Great hospitality. Although at first sight this accommodation gave me a sour note ,",AlaganM,/Profile/AlaganM,Kuala Lumpur,30

uttarkashi,"I do not agree with the comments written here in a previous post by some traveler (MIRAGOENKA).  I visited Camp Nirvana Guptkashi in the month of June 2012, with my family. You get a panoramic view of Himalayan peaks. The staff is decent, and always ready for prompt services.   The hot water is supplied in buckets, obviously they need time for it. Food is hygienic and tasty..... I liked it so much, that extended our stay from one nights to three nights.... in all, a warm hospitality...   I only suggest them to provide Fan  Cooler in the tents, as in day time its a basic requirement. And also if they come with some activity area for children (Indoor / outdoor games etc.).  An internet connected PC at reception, would be just another good facility to provide.",SumitUniyal76,/Profile/SumitUniyal76,"Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India",40
uttarkashi,"The inside of the camps at Camp Nirvana is okay. They have a double bed with clean linens, a table and a couple of glasses for water. A single CFL light bulb is used for lighting. There is one slot available for charging cellphones/laptops/cameras. The bathroom has a WC, a basin and a bathing area. There are a couple of chairs outside the tent.  The service is good and enthusiastic. I don't know how it would be like in the peak seasons of May and June... but when I visited in September 2011, the boys there were going about their tasks with a smile on their face at all times. They were all very polite and hospitable. Since 24-hours running hot water is not available (and it would be foolish to expect it to be there), you have to ask them to bring hot water buckets to your camp",Shridhar_Jaju,/Profile/Shridhar_Jaju,"Yavatmal, India",40

I am not a tent person, so really didnt like all the creepy crawlies walking around.We were lucky to atleast have a fan..rest of the tents didn't have them. It has a huge bed with clean linens. A rustic bathroom with WC. No hot water. You have to wait your turn to get hot water in the morning, which is lugged up and down by the 'boys' It gets really hot in the tent during day time. Food is edible. Nothing to write home about. Breakfast is terrible. People in other tents are really loud and hence u will find sleeping early difficult Camp Boys are really helpful and cheerful The nature around will take ur breath away. beautiful yamuna river",Preeti A,/Profile/preetiPune,"Pune, India",20

We arrived late in the evening and its difficult to see surrounding area or complete camp area.   We entered our tent and to our surprise it was very clean and with attached bath facility. Bed was comfortable and linen was neat and clean. They served dinner in a small dinning hall - not a lavish buffet but very tasty indeed and after completing Chardham Yatra I realise that this was one of the best.
