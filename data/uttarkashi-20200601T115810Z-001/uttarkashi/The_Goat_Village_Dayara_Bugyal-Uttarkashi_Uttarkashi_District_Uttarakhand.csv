uttarkashi,"I visitied Goat Village Dayara Bugyal in the month of October with my family. This eco-stay provides amazing views of the Himalayas. You can see the white mountain peaks from your room. The beauty of the place is breathtaking. Dayara Bugyal is famous for the trekkers. More than anything, what I loved most about Goat Village is their amazing concept of building the sustainable lifestyle for villagers and bringing them back to their roots. These villagers have such an amazing culture, the hospitality, the positivity and love in their hearts. Overall I would say The Goat Village, Dayara Bugyal is not just an option to go, it is indeed a place to experience rich culture, astounding Himalayan landscape, heart warming hospitality, and super tasty healthy local food.",Shiksha Swaraj,/Profile/lostilllusion,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
uttarkashi,"We stayed there for 3 days with my friends .It is  situated at an altitude of 7000ft in the lap of mother nature . With almost very less use of electricity, our rooms  were lit with candles and kereosene lamps . They provide hands on farming experience around the property and was also the best place to do an early morning yoga.   The views from the rooms were amazing and the stay was perfect.   The meals we had there were organically grown local pahadi dishes and very tasty.   Pravin ji , the caretaker took very good care of us. We even got the privelage of trekking and camping around the place. Would love to visit again soon.  ",Harsh vardhan,/Profile/hraim1,,50
uttarkashi,"The Goat Village, Dayara Bugyal, situated at 7000ft. beautifully carved cozy wooden cottages. Within the farm stay premises, we have one common/dining area and a kitchen with minimal electricity. Rest of the space doesn't have electricity by design and gets lit up on candles and kerosene lamps in the evenings. A highly recommended place for Yoga and Meditation. Definitely one of a kind Yoga Retreat in India with good Vegan Food options. Priyanka Rana made our stay very memorable and extremely hospitable lady.",Anish Veigas,/Profile/anishveigas1990,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
uttarkashi,"Everything around there was so peaceful. Hameer ji and family were very co operating and helped us to witness the beautiful environment around the place. The view was amazing, the food was  delicious and the environment was very clean. The food they gave us was produced organically and they had a place to store excess water so that it doesnt get wasted . The property is pet friendly and just being around pets , makes everything perfect.",Kapil Narula,/Profile/kapilnarula,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
uttarkashi,"The Goat Village at Dayara Bugyal is so so refreshing. We spent the days doing yoga, trying our hands at farming, even rearing sheep and eating fresh and delicious garhwali food. The views are like nothing I have seen before and pace of life wonderfully slow. The perfect break for a city dweller! And thankyou Priyanka Rana taking such good care of us.",Rukmini V,/Profile/rukminiv,,50

uttarkashi,"The Goat Village (TGV), Dayara Bugyal is a small & beautiful cottage cum hotel in village Raithal, which is around 40 kms from Uttarkashi.  I visited TGV in April 2019 and was mesmerised by the beauty of this place. It is on the way to Dayara Bugyal, which is a famous trek in that region.   The cottages are extremely nice and you can be, all by yourself, as it is far away from the commercial hubs.   Biggest plus : - Away from commercial activities. Be at peace.  - Magnificient sceneries all around - Extremely helpful staff - Comfortable cottages  Attention point - Limited connectivity to the nearest town (Uttarkashi). So you have to have your own vehicle or plan the cab appropriately  I will strongly recommend TGV Dayara Bugyal, if someone is looking for something ""different"" :)",Vishmanjo,/Profile/Vishmanjo,"Hyderabad, India",50
uttarkashi,"I had the most wonderful stay at the goat village. Priyankar and Harveer made me feel so welcome the minute I stepped foot through the gate. In such a beautiful peaceful setting, I just kept extending my stay - didn‚Äôt want to leave! Walks up in the mountains, the sound of birdsong, sunrise over the himalayas and the most gorgeous food.

uttarkashi,The Goat Village at Dayara Bugyal has everything to offer the active and the not so active traveller. The place offers excellent views of the Himalayas as well as an opportunity to meet and interact with the local community.

uttarkashi,"I stayed in Goat Village Dayra Bugyal for 2 nights with my wife and 2 kids. I had to reschedule and prepone my stay coming from Gangotri. The team was more than willing to accomodate. The rooms facing the Himalayan range are cozy with a window seating. You could just sit there staring at the hills and surroundings as birds come visit you. Priyanka Rana, who takes care of the hospitality at the place, makes you get comfortable like at home without the overly in-your-face service. Don't come here if you want to be treated like a king with all luxuries. Come here if you want to feel at home, feel grounded, feel warmth and connect. The best thing my kids enjoyed was the trek to Dayra Bugyal. yashveer Rana, the local guide, was awesome, as he took us through the path, shared stories",santshiv,/Profile/santshiv,"Bengaluru, India",50

uttarkashi,"Situated on the trail to Dayara Bugyal, Goat Village Dayara is a perfect place to acclimatize and relax before/after hiking. It's also a stunningly beautiful property where you can spend days gazing at the Himalayas. Pack a good book- and a sweater and umbrella to meet the whims of the weather- and there's little else one can ask for. Raithal local Priyanka is a wonderful manager and guide. Shobini serves up platters of nutritious and delicious Garhwali food. To see the fields from where you're lunch is grown, and to talk to the farmers who sow the crops is a truly enriching experience. If you're on a budget- the dormitories are warm and cozy.",niveditanath,/Profile/niveditanath,"Dehradun, India",50
uttarkashi,This place reminded me of my childhood when we used to go to Nani‚Äôs house where we had no electricity & all we used to do was to count the stars & just be with our own thoughts. This place offers you moment of quite introspection where one can just sit back & relax without unwanted disturbance from electronic gadgets which has actually gripped everybody in city life. The extreme warmth & love extended by TGV staff is icing on the cake which actually gave this trip a feeling of completeness. (Priyanka..Lovingly we called her Manager Sahab & our lovely chef Shobniya). Our stay was taken care of extremely well & with both our host it was not less than meeting an old friend. We just couldn‚Äôt stop finish talking since the connection between ‚ÄúKumaoni‚Äù & ‚ÄúGarhwali‚Äù was going pretty,Anjali K,/Profile/796anjalik,,50
uttarkashi,"I had booked TGV Raithal a few weeks before my travel and being a solo traveller, wanted to have the whole hitch hiking experience in an unknown place. So after my flight landed in dehradun early morning at 7am, I began my trip to Raithal. After taking a ride from 5 different vehicles(Airport terminal - airport exit, airport exit - natraj chowk rishikesh, Natraj chowk - chinyalisaud, Chinyalisaud - Uttarkashi and lastly Uttarkashi - Raithal) I reached Raithal at 6 30 PM. All through the journey, Priyanka from the goat village was checking up on me and taking updates.The goat village is a 10 minute hike from the place where the taxis stop. Completely exhausted from the travel, I had a very warm welcome from the staff at TGV. Since it was already dark, there was nothing much to",Samarth R,/Profile/135samarthr,"Mangalore, India",50

My experience of staying with green people India has been overwhelming, they took care of every minute detail, from food to stay and arranging my trek to Dayara Bugyal.

It was a highly satisfying experience for me to be at this place probably at the best time of the year. From services to food to having a comfortable stay, nothing lacked.

uttarkashi,"Goat village is nice concept. Stay there was quite good. It has beautiful sorroundings. The huts are quite comfortable. Food is good but some might have to develop some taste sense local organic food they serve, although it's very healthy. The best part is the hospitality ,specially by the two girls serving there. I suggest to provide dim light in the rooms in ethnic style.I also suggest to provide electricity in the charging points.",drpiyush2002,/Profile/drpiyush2002,"Dehradun, India",40
uttarkashi,"This has been one the best experiences I have had before and after the trek.

uttarkashi,If there is one place I would want to go back again and again then this is it. I was always of the opinion that Himachal pradesh is better but this place changed my mind. With the best staff and awesome location I think this is one of the best spots to hang out if you have 3-4 days. In monsoon it absolutely felt like Swiss alps landscape that we see in pictures. Just go there and forget the city,Nikhil K,/Profile/NikhilK1376,,50
uttarkashi,We stayed here for ten days. Being surrounded by pristine nature and easy access to treks was good enough to fulfill our desire of wanderlust.  We've enjoyed every moment here.

uttarkashi,"It was my second Goat Village stay, I am already very impressed by the whole idea of self sustainable village and The Goat Village, Dayara Bugyal has alot more than that to offer.  It is a perfect destination for a peaceful hide out, where you can enjoy your own time, try the vegan food (my favourite), volunteer in the local farm, mediate, practise yoga and go for a hike too.  Location: It is located on top of a village which makes it easier to locate and in case you need basic grocery products, it's just a walk away.  Rooms: The cottages are as comfortable as it can be, with a magnificent view in the comfort of your bed. I really appreciate the cleanliness they maintain.  Food (yes lets talk about that): Living a city life, I am literally sick of preserved and adulterated food.",mita_hsingh,/Profile/mita_hsingh,"New Delhi, India",50
uttarkashi,"Located just at the base of Dayara Bugyal Trek, I was in love with the property. An open lounge and Cottages looking at beautiful lush Uttarakhand mountains. But my favourite was the people. Humble and so sweet to talk. I kept asking about Goat Village culture and they were more then happy to tell me the complete history.  And to make the whole experience more delightful, every meal and breakfast was probably the healthiest one I've ever had. Some of local cuisine were made straight out their organic farms.  If you are truly looking to disconnect from the metro life and immerse yourself into nature, this is the perfect place.   P.S. Their Cinnamon Tea is just too good. Also try their Green apple Chutney. (I think it's seasonal)",Vishal B,/Profile/VishalB1005,,50
uttarkashi,"A cup of hot camomile tea, freshly plucked from their garland, and shining white Himalayan peaks right in front is how The Goat Village, Dayara Bugyal welcomed me. Wooden cottages that blends architecturally so well with that environment are the first things that will catch your eyes as soon as you reach the place, and one of those was my abode for the rest of my time at The Goat Village. A picture perfect start for my day, nothing can be better than that for a mountain lover.  Along with the astounding views, the generosity of people and their amazing hospitality is something that I wouldn't be wrong if I call it my second home.
