uttarkashi,"I highly recommend Shivalayaa Yoga Shala. Amazing place and wondeful people: not only Naveen and Diksha who treated us as their own family, but also all the members of the staff made us feel at home. The food was delicious and the TTC was beyond expectations so, if you are thinking about doing a TTC or spending a few days in India, this is the perfect place for you!!",Sandra G,/Profile/N2373SUsandrag,,50

uttarkashi,What an Amazing place to visit. The beauty is all around you. Mother Ganga is just 5-10 minuets walking from Shivalayaa. They have  simple and really clean rooms and everything. Beautiful Yog Hall as well for yoga and meditation. Really peaceful place. You must visit if you are looking for peace and beauty. Their staff are really helpful. The food is amazing and 100 perfect vegetarian without Garlic and onion. Big mountain to walk around and people in the village very kind. Perfect place to visit. I really liked eating on the floor. ,NaveenRana,/Profile/NaveenRana,"Uttarkashi, India",50
uttarkashi,"A bliss in paradise.. The accommodation is very clean and fresh. The food is sattvic and heavenly!!  They have Yoga vacations, teacher training courses and yoga retreats at this place. Joined in for a yoga retreat programme and super happy. Itâ€™s closer to nature with the view of mountains. ",DikshaSharma,/Profile/DikshaSharma,"Uttarkashi, India",40
