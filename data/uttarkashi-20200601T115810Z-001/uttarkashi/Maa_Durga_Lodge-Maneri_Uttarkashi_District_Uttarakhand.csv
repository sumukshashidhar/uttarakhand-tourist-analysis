uttarkashi,"Stayed for two nights while on way to Gangotri pilgrimage with my extended family. Booked the family room and three double bed rooms. The rooms are small but fine for overnight stay. We reached in the late afternoon and left early next morning for Gangotri Dhaam. After performing the puja at Gangotri we returned to the lodge by early afternoon and spend few hours exploring the area.. The facility is on the banks of Bhagirathi. Since we were the only group staying, it looked like a home away from home. There was limited menu options but the owner called us in advance to ask about our preference, which was really sweet. There was no fuss in making stay and food arrangements for our driver, all free of cost. I would say, its a cozy place and one of the best options while on",blackpanther,/Profile/blackbulbul,,50
