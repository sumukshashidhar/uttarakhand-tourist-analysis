uttarkashi,"Kuflon Basics is a beautiful and wonderfully laid back property nestled amidst lush green mountains. There is a bit of steep climb up from the road, but its well worth the effort! Ideal place to unwind and relax with family or friends!!  There's ample space to play around, with lots of trees to climb and friendly, well behaved and lazy dogs for company, a huge Rock- which became the sit-out for the kids, and also useful for some star gazing at night.  The rooms (and bathrooms) are very spacious, clean and well thought out, with net screens on windows (to prevent insects from creeping in) and skylights to let in natural light. Recommend the first floor rooms with their beautiful views and sit-outs in the balcony. Ditto for the dining area- spacious, organised and clean with",Mitun10,/Profile/Mitun10,"New Delhi, India",40
uttarkashi,"When we arrived at Kuflon Basics, after a long and exhausting drive from Mussoorie, the 250 meter hike up the steps along the hillside looked intimidating. And it was a tough climb.  But so worth it.   The place, all of 5 rooms spread over a tiny sliver of land perched on the hillside, is pure magic. Peaceful and isolated, but takes care of all the needs of travellers looking for a break from the mundane. The rooms are sparsely done, but comfortable. There's running hot water in the showers.  And the food, while simple, is delicious - the chef is a genius with mutton!   Above all, it's also the magnanimous and warm presence of the hosts, Anil and Seema, who are always there, charming and warm without being overbearing and intrusive, who make the difference.

Pros Nice hub which has access to some drinks like pudina, fruit juice etc Good neat and spacious rooms Hidden natural water pool (do take your beer or other drinks to enjoy) Good food  Cons The only problem is that it requires good 7-10 mins uphill walk.

uttarkashi,"I spent a night at Kuflon before heading out to Dodital for a trek. And was very pleasantly surprised an amazingly beautiful place to stay in the middle of literally nowhere. It's remote, even from Uttarkashi and you need to have a very genuine love affair with the mountains to land up at Kuflon. It is nestled just above the Assi Ganga and the place has a peace and calm that is difficult to put in words. It feels like a home away from home. fresh and delicious food with all the comforts that you can think of. What makes the most difference is the presence and hospitality of the owners/hosts. Tremendously helpful, warm and friendly, they are doing whatever it takes to make the stay comfortable. It's a place where there is nothing much to do except to walk, read and laze around.",Sameer2011,/Profile/Sameer2011,"New Delhi, India",50

All add to the charm of the place. You can even try a few hikes that can be done around, surely worth the scenic views.  Do note that the property is a small hike from the road. Though the hike is a very easy one, please pack as light as you can. The hosts and the helpers at the property will be more than happy to carry all your luggage up the property, buy you surely would regret troubling them.

Playing word games all the way, taking panoramic shots of the majestic Himalayas and the Ganga beneath.
