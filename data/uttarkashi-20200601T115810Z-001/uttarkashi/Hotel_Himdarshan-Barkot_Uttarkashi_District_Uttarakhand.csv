uttarkashi,"We were in a package & we started our yatra of Chardham from Haridwar while going to Yamunotri our 1st day halt was at Hotel Him Darshan-Barkot , i think we were the first to stay at this hotel in this season , i have not seen bad hotel like this in my life they were not having basic facility in there hotel like proper electricity , no proper windows in rooms , no hot water facility staff behavior was also very rood after my night stay in morning while speaking to some one i came to know that they close there hotel for 6-8 months once chardham yatra stops and once chardham yatra starts they come and open all the rooms directly without maintenance, my suggestion is not to stay in this hotel.",SagarThakker,/Profile/SagarThakker,"Ahmedabad, India",20
