uttarkashi,"Stayed in this hotel during Kedarkantha trek which was provided by organizers. Day one stay was provided in basic room but on last day in basement decent room was provided. Only on last day we got hot water as temperature outside was less than 5Â©. With connectivity to outside world, this hotel seems best option in Sankri even view from balcony is nice.

uttarkashi,"This small hotel is situated in Sankri village, on way to Har-ki-Dun. Sankri is the starting point for Kedarkantha trek, hence this hotel serves as the base point for tourists.  Rooms are small, but well maintained. Hot water facility is available via solar geyzers. Electricity is available 24*7 (Generator facility available). Kitchen serves good variety of food, however small restaurants are situated just outside the hotel on walking distance.  Overall- thumbsup!",GeetAdhikari,/Profile/GeetAdhikari,"Udaipur, India",50
