uttarkashi,"Hotel located at Ranachati, a remote village on way to Yamunotri ( Chardham Circuit) - 10 Kms from Janakichatti, the last motorable base point from where Yamunotri trek starts. Hotel offers very basic ameneties - NO TV / NO HOT WATER facility in rooms. However, Mr Anil Chauhan, owner of the property,  was helpful to accommodate us in another hotel at Barkot, since Hotel Anil was inaccessible due to major landslides at Sayanachatti, at no extra cost.  The location of the hotel is in remote village without decent infrastructure, hence advisable to stay at Barkot town.  Double / Triple / Quadruple occupancy rooms with attached bath available. Nearest town Barkot is approx 35 Kms away.",DurgeshRajadhyaksha,/Profile/DurgeshRajadhyaksha,"Mumbai, India",30
