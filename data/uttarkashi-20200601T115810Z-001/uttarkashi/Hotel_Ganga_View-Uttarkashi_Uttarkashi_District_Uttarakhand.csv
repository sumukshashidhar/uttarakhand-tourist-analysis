uttarkashi,Total waste of money. Total let down. Unethical people. Looks like a worst hotel in vicinity. Untrained staff. Food is cooked in dirty kitchen. No power back up. Staff availability very poor. Hotel owner//manager very uncooperative. Bill is only given on demand. And very few customer demand bill.  Kitchen pics us attached.   Hotel even does not worth single star.,Adhu_Adhikari,/Profile/Adhu_Adhikari,"New Delhi, India",10

uttarkashi,"Хороший отель. Достался номер с видом на Гангу. Достаточно чисто для отеля такого класса. Очень обходительный персонал. В номере есть горячая вода. Простыни достаточно чистые. Ночью немного шумно - рядом дорога. Номера просторные, ванная комната не маленькая.",Mikhail Mezentsev,/Profile/MikhailM4,"Moscow, Russia",40
