uttarkashi,"We recently spent three nights here with my in laws. Though the facilities are basic,this is probably the best place to stay in Gangotri. All the staffs are extremely helpful. Most importantly, the owner of the property, Nikhilesh Jee is a very helpful person and takes every possible care of the guests. Would definitely come back if we happen to visit Gangotri again.",Indranil b,/Profile/IBhattacharjee,"Kolkata, India",50
uttarkashi,"We had a great time at Hotel Manisha in October 2019. Originally we only wanted to stay only two days, in the end it was seven days because we liked it so much.  We lived in a cottage and can only report positive things: Clean, quiet and a great view into the valley from the community terrace.  Also the restaurant was great. The food always tasted good and was absolutely digestible, the staff was super friendly and often we had interesting conversations with other people.  We would especially like to emphasize the friendliness and helpfulness of the owner Nikhilesh Semwal, who answered all our questions in a warm and competent manner. Whether Gaumukh-Trek or activities in Gangotri - the information from Nikhilesh was always absolutely helpful. Thank you very much for your help,",Marc L.,/Profile/Marc-LindArt,,50
uttarkashi,"We arrived at Gangotri after dark on a cold October evening. The Hotel manager greeted us warmly and we were promptly  shown to our rooms. The room was reasonably OK but the problem was with the Toilet. It was wet with the washbasin and toilet leaking all through. No hot water since there was no power. No heater in the room - as such we were really cold at night. Since we had to get ready and leave for Gaumukh at 530 in the morning, it was a real challenge getting ready in the dark and even brush with ice-cold water. The food served in the small eatery below is just enough for survival. Poor hygenic standards and very basic menu - despite all the warmth and friendly attitude of the staff. Perhaps not too many options in Gangotri - so keep expectations at the bare minimum.",whirlwindexplorer,/Profile/whirlwindexplorer,Chennai,30

uttarkashi,Being back to oneself or at least try to be back to one'S innerself is what we need now a days. With a group of yoga team from Germany we tried that this month. We successfully completed our Gomugh trekking. We were staying in Gangothry for 2 days for acclimatising ourself. Hotel Manisha at the lap of Himalaya gave us all what we expected. Neat and tidy rooms. Clean bathroom with running hotwater. The very thing that attracted us was the corridor where we could do our daily yoga sessions. Director Mr.Nikhilesh took personal care of us. Being vegan diet we needed extra care in our food. The reastaurant attached to the hotel tried their level best to provide us our expected menu. Here you will really feel your tranquility for more that what you expected and paid.,AyurReise,/Profile/AyurReise,,50
uttarkashi,"Gangotri is very nice place and people like to stay (night) in Hotel Manisha although room service of this hotel is not so good. Foods are expensive, even water bottle (2 litre) costs Rs. 40/-. But the hotel is situated just beside the main road which goes to the temple (Ganga maa) and beside the river is bhagirathi. Bus stand is close (3 minutes walking) to this hotel.",soumeng2016,/Profile/soumeng2016,"Kolkata, India",30
