uttarkashi,"The location of the lodge is very good, just before the city. Enjoy the unhindered view of the river Yamuna and the hills across the road. However, the services are average, like other similarly placed lodges/hotels. You'll get only 1 towel per room. The rooms are cleaned probably when you leave, or maybe not. So, better insist on cleaning in front of you. Don't expect tea/breakfast in the morning on the day of yatra to Yamunotri. Take a bath if you dare to bathe in cold water. Better to take a dip in the hot water pond at the Yamunotri temple.",Arun Golas,/Profile/Arun_Golas,"Bhopal, India",30
