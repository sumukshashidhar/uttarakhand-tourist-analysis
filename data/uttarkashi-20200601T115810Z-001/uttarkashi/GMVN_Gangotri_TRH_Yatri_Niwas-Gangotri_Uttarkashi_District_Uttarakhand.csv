uttarkashi,"Located very close to the temple, the TRH is across the river.  The STD rooms are very cramped and their carpets are extremely dirty - if you walk on them, your feet will get dirty.  The Dlx rooms are spacious with wooden flooring - but very poorly maintained.   The quilt covers are also quite dirty - though better than the std rooms.  They do give you blanket and a quilt so you can have a snug into them in the cold!!!  Older people will have quite a climb when you come back from the property.  Property has a very nice location of course on the banks of the revered Ganga and is say less than a KM from the temple.  Staff is nice.",7099rishid,/Profile/7099rishid,"Mumbai, India",10
uttarkashi,"Well friends,GMVN Gangotri Yatri Niwas has probably the best location in Gangotri,positioned almost above the Gangotri temple in very close proximity, with marvellous views of the temple compound and the holy Ganges to boast of.To the Chardham Yatris it may be the best option to reside in , as all the holy rituals,the Ganga Aarti,the pujas can be observed from the balconies and terraces of the hotel itself, for those who rather want to avoid the heavy rush of the devotees.For the ardent and devoted ones though,the Temple can be reached within a few seconds and pujas can be offered as par their convenience in a hassle-free manner.The room rents are minimum with small basic dormitory type rooms,with availability of online booking.Although I opted for the other GMVN TRH located on",Soutik H,/Profile/soutikh2015,"Kolkata, India",40
uttarkashi,The property is just located near to Suryakunda and just opposite to Bhagirothi. All destinations are within 500-1500 meter. Rooms are specious but unmaintained. Food service is not good and overrated.   Can have view of Mt Sudrashan and Mt Kedar from Hotel terrace.,Tanmoy B,/Profile/tanmoyb697,"Kolkata, India",40
uttarkashi,There r 2 TRH under GMVN Gangotri. One is near mandir nd one is near Suraj kund. We stayed near suraj kund. The car will be approx 500 mt at parking lot from the rest house. It's a basic hotel with basic amenities nd kitchen. Area is quite cold. River water coming from gomukh quite chilled nd nerve shivering. Ganga aarti in evening but not like Haridwar's Har ki Paudi. From here lots of trekking starts. One such is Gomukh nd Tapovan. Very tough one. From here u can go to Harsil where u can see Mandakini fall. Its here Ram teri Ganga Maili film shot. Hotel is good as per the area. Perhaps it's the best one.,Amit Agarwal,/Profile/AmitA2071,"Howrah, India",40
