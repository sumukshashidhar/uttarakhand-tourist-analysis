uttarkashi,"This is one of the best hotels we stayed in with the best view of the hills. When I stayed there I felt like I  stayimg at home. Room was large with a sitting area. The room was very, very clean. The staff was very friendly, helpful and professional. I definitely would stay at this hotel again.You will get evrything nearby this hotel-Taxi Stand, ATM, Market n also you can go for a walk to River which is max. 5 min away from this beautiful property. Also, they have a small Cafe like tea shop where everyone should try tea. I will recommend KNB Heritage to my friends. Thank you KNB for making my stay enjoyable n awsome.",Happiness817130,/Profile/Happiness817130,,50
uttarkashi,"I stayed here in this April and May.  The manager and young staff were very kind. The manager can speak English and he is so polite!!  Actually, I had a plan to join the Teacher Training Course of Sivananda  Yoga in April. I looked up this hotel on the Google Map. I stayed here on the previous day one night. I could stay here confortablly so I stayed again with my partner after TTC.  I'd like to stay this hotel again! Thank you for the manager's kindness! I recommend this hotel if you visit Netala.

uttarkashi,"We stayed at this hotel for one night on our way back from Gangotri and it was a very good experience. We booked three triple occupancy rooms, all were in great condition with basic facilities like hot water and TV. The rooms are cozy and the hotel stands at a prominent location right on the Gangotri highway and at a short distance from the Vishwanath Temple. They do not have any meal facilities but that was already informed to us by the owner Mr. Prakash Bhadri. The owner and the staff were humble and quite helpful. Over all it was a great and cozy stay.",Poojak247,/Profile/Poojak247,"Mumbai, India",40

uttarkashi,"Dear Traveller,  I'm a fellow traveller who came down to this place from Yamunotri and found this place peaceful and comfortable. The owner Badri is a young chap who is really helpful and subtle himself.   Well to be a little more elaborate I went there asking him for an Air-Conditioned room. He politely told me he does not have one and most hotels in Uttarkashi didn't have them but if I wanted one I could go down the opposite alley and find one in the Ghrewal Guest house.   I chose to stay back and the owners gestures to welcome and most of the hotel's amenities were excellent for the price he charged.  Mr. Badri spend the most time he could with me to ensure my stay was comfortable. He was helpful with every information I asked for. From the typical bus timings to the extreme",Shyaam,/Profile/ShyaamSolo,"Chennai, India",50
uttarkashi,"""HOMEY AWAY FROM HOME"" After completing the first dham i.e Yamunotri we headed for the second dham i.e Gangotri and the best place to stay for the same is Uttarkashi. It takes  approximately 3hrs to reach Uttarkashi via bus from Barkot, fare being very cheap.  Rates are very nominal for the rooms. We had pre booked two rooms in the hotel via GOIBIBO and got hefty discounts and i would suggest you to do the same as well. I would strongly recommend people to use GOIBIBO, MAKEMYTRIP, OYO and BOOKING.COM as online portal for making reservations. Sites like Clear Trip and Travelguru are highly unreliable and you would end up making fools out of yourselves.  The hotel is located in the heart of the city opposite to the collectorate office of Uttarakhand and hence easily locatable. The",Nawanit S,/Profile/NawanitS2,"Purnea, India",50
