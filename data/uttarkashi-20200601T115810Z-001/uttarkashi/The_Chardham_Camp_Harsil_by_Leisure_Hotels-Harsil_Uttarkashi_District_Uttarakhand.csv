uttarkashi,We stayed here on our way to Gangotri. It took us a bit longer to find them as they are not in Harsil but in a nearby town called Dharali. After getting over the annoyance of that once we reached that everything was a superb experience. Mr Vjijay - Manager there was simply awesome. Kids were a bit skeptical about living in an actual tent...however once they saw the tents and living arrangements everyone relaxed. Food was excellent. They took special care for my wife who is gluten and nuts free. She was served special dishes off the menu and that too with a smile. Our tent was on river bank and hence sounds of the Ganga was very soothing entire time we were there. Views of the snow clad Gangotri mountains and the town of Mukwa were some other highlights.   In the end we would,dss999,/Profile/dss999,"Atlanta, Georgia",50
uttarkashi,No Value. Normal road side hotel in Harsi are better than this camp. Average food. PLEASE AVOID No access to river though it is on river side tents are very small food is very average not allowed to do born fire as there are apple trees around basically they have leased out an apple orchid and have put in tents where ever they have found space.,Saket R,/Profile/525saketr,,10
uttarkashi,"We booked 3 tents next to river. Must say , it was an awesome experience. Kids loved it.  Positives :  Scenic and blissful One of its kind of experience next to river Lots of trees with hanging fruits..was a fun for kids Located near main road to Gangotri Good food We were served tea even at 12 pm - sitting in open with group under moon light and next to flowing river and having hot tea was an heavenly feeling Reasonably maintained tents  Negatives:  Need to work on maintenance specially in bathroom  Overall a must visit place while on the go to Gangotri. No issues with safety. Kids can be their own. Its an experience one must have atleast once. ",Prabhat J,/Profile/prabhat_fca,"Mumbai, India",40

uttarkashi,"We spent a day at Harshil camp.  We got the tents, which were right next to the river bank - this was the best part of the our stay.  We were up till mid night sitting next to river and chatting with friends.  The staff was quite cooperative to serve us tea at 11 pm. Food is also nice.  In terms of areas of improvement, it is promoted as a luxury camp - in my assessment, it is not close to a luxury category of camp; basic and nice.  They also refer to a number of activities, but there are none.  Warm water supply is limited to 30 mins, and it is erratic with water being muddy - was a problem with kids.  Our objective was to stay at a campsite next river in hills, which was served just about right.",Rahul P,/Profile/634rahulp,"Mumbai, India",30
uttarkashi,"Nestled amongst apple and walnut trees, this camp overlooks the River Ganges and the majestic Himalayas. The camp has a very picturesque location and amazing views (especially room nos 9,10,11, 12). This is the 2nd Leisure Hotels property that I stayed in, in Uttarakhand. I stayed at this tented camp for two nights while visiting Gangotri Dham.  On the plus side, their food was delicious and wholesome and the staff were exceptional with their service. They left no stone unturned to make our stay comfortable. They woke up as early as 3 am to provide us with hot water, morning tea, breakfast, packed lunch for our pilgrimage to Gangotri or our onward journey. They were always ready to cater to our needs. Rinku (at the camp) in particular was very helpful. He accompanied us to",ANJUGOELA,/Profile/ANJUGOELA,MUMBAI,40

uttarkashi,"We had two nights booking at Harsil camp made by leisure hotels as part of their chardham yatra package tour. BTW, makemytrip chardham yatra also uses the same camp/package. When we reached camp from Barkot we were told they are overbooked and the camp reserved for us was given to another customer. Camp manager was complaining that their Delhi office accepts bookings without consulting them for availability. This is very unprofessional of leisure hotels and causes uncertainty of accommodation. This is unacceptable for the money they charge for the yatra package. Camp manager finally made us wait for 2 hours while cleaned one of the newly setup camps and for second day he moved us to a regular camp. This left a bad experience of the camp. Also, Harsil is the coldest among places",Srinidhi H,/Profile/SrinidhiH3,,10
uttarkashi,"The camp is said to made up during the summer begining and every year they take out all tent materials and refix the same. Due to which there is lot of issues, such as walking to and fro from dinner tent is bad and connectivity is very poor only BSNL works and that too if towers are up and running. From bathrooms water does not drain and food is not very good.  But the area is fully covered by Apple orchards and river bhagirathi flows nearby and there is a Mahadev Temple, it is said no covering can be built on that and tried and feel down. Near to this temple you can visit the river and have nice time. Also there is nearby village called Mukhwas, where gangotri Devi is kept during winter season. The old classic village is very steep to climb but it gives a real pleasure if some",jvd4801,/Profile/jvd4801,"Mumbai, India",30
uttarkashi,"My wife and me had confirmed booking in this camp during our Chardham package tour booked through Make My Trip, in May 2016. After a long quite tiresome journey from Barkot, when we reached this Harsil camp in the afternoon, we were told by the Manager that all the tents were not ready / completed, only one tent was available and over booking had been done by the management based in Delhi. The only available tent was a small one, in pathetic condition, with a single bed, no shower, but a tap and a bucket to take bath. When we refused to check-in, we were offered a room in a newly constructed hotel, Prakriti Resort at Dharoli, about 2 kms away. This hotel was nice but  was located in isolated place and had the problem of frequent power failures. Being peak season, we had no other",Santu18,/Profile/Santu18,"Mumbai, India",20
uttarkashi,This place is truly heaven for nature lovers and feels like true paradise on earth. We visited in the month of April so atmosphere was at its best. Surrounded by hills and trees and on the bank of river where unplanned development is restricted due to Indian army station so it works in nature lover's favor since beauty remains unchanged. Camp itself is not very luxurious but fulfills basic requirement criteria. Food offering is not wide but tasty and satisfying one. If you can adjust bit comfort level is pretty okay.  Location is their biggest advantage. ,Manandani,/Profile/Manandani,"Mumbai, India",40
uttarkashi,"It was harvest season and each tree in the orchard bore thousands of apples. We had to avoid red and green apples striking us when we walked to our tent. Luxury tented camp on Bhagirati river is surrounded by awesome scenery of majestic hills, revealing rear snowpeaks.  We trekked upto the quaint little town of Mukba and were blown away by the curteous hospitality of our unknow, casual hosts at this winter home of Goddess Ganga.Don't know if it was cold weather or the treks that we took to neighboring villages or it was just a way of wading cold, we just ate more than usual. Service was quick and six staff at the camp efficiently managed to serve our frequent requests for hot water, tea and hot food.  We woke-up to prayer chantings from the nearby temple.

uttarkashi,"We spent two days in Chardham Camp in June, 2014, Harsil. We were totally unprepared for the beauty of the place, which is an orchard on the banks of the Bhagirathi which was in spate. The tents were cosy, clean and inviting, bathrooms too were clean and functional. Food was wholesome and delicious, but had to be ordered in advance. But we were not in a hurry, so it didn't matter. The view was stupendous with snow capped peaks all around and the thundering river literally a stone's throw away. It was a magical stay in the lap of mother nature. Not a place though for those wanting a luxurious stay, its a camp but a very comfortable one. Definitely recommended. Ask for the tents closer to the river. We stayed in Chukhamba & Shivling. Would definitely like to repeat the experience.",Wanderworld13,/Profile/Wanderworld13,Guwahati,50
uttarkashi,In fact it is in dharali village.beauti at its best wherever you look you find mother nature talking to you.best time to go there is october when apples ripe and the whole place just lights up.just nearby a foot bridge is there over bhagirathi go and spend some time over the bridge believe me it will be memorable.,sanjaywari,/Profile/sanjaywari,"Varanasi, India",50
uttarkashi,"This the best place to camp in the Uttarkhand region. The camp is located in an apple orchard next to the Bhagirathi (Ganga) river. The surrounding view is amazing with greenery and snow covered peak all around. There is a very old temple next to the property and mornings you wake up to the soothing bell clanks & temple aatri. There is a ghat next to the temple where you can take a dip in the chilled water of the river, or just sit beside by the river soothening your soul by watching the river flow by.The food is awesome and the service is prompt & efficient.",Vikastri,/Profile/Vikastri,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",50

uttarkashi,"The camp itself is quite basic. But very close to the camp is a walk along the river Ganges which is very nice with gorgeous views. There is also an ancient Pandava temple very close by that is amazing.  The camp was nice, but it was very cold in the night.  We asked the staff for Hot Water bottles and they provided the same.",Imrash,/Profile/Imrash,"Austin, Texas",40
uttarkashi,We are Chardham camp fans and prefer to stay at these camps wherever available. We have been travelling extensively in Uttaranchal and have experienced 4 of the Chardham camps. We loved the Harshil one especially due to the lovely apple garden. We reached late night and it was a pleasant surprise in the morning when we found ourselves in the garden. The staff as usual were friendly and helpful.,bloretravelbug,/Profile/bloretravelbug,Bangalore,50
uttarkashi,"Chardham Camp, Harsil was one of the places we stayed on our Chardham tour to Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedarnath and badrinath. Were we lucky to get to this place? Yes, but it took a lot of hard work to find decent accommodation in this route. The camp is basic, with two single camp cots, one table and 2 plastic chairs, but the attached washroom had running hot water and western WC, quite a rare thing on this route. But best of all, the food was exceptional, and most important, hygienic. Believe me, on this route it is normal to get an upset stomach because of atrocious hygiene and thanks to our sanitized stomachs, but we came back all in one piece. We were travelling with  my older brother and sister in law  from Hyderabad and was constantly worried about their stomach condition.",sattalbird,/Profile/sattalbird,"Gurgaon District, India",40
uttarkashi,"It’s called a Deluxe (Luxury) camp but it’s a tent! Very cold, no heat, no shower, no hot water (they’ll bring a bucket if you want, and they did bring a hot water bottle). The tent is drafty and dirty. The sheets and towels are badly stained. But the guys try hard and are gentle and helpful. The tents are spread closely in an apple orchard (and the apples are very good), the views are limited but lovely, the air is invigorating, and it was only one night!",Paul K,/Profile/go2places,California,20
