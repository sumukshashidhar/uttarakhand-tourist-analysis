uttarkashi,Garhwal Resort in village Natin (Nateen) is a newly built beautiful lodge with traditional architecture. I stayed there for two days and used this place as base for my trek to the amazing Dayara Bugyal. The staff is very friendly and the owner Rajkinder is a nice person.   The homely food was tasty and served hot. The view of Himalayas from this place is very beautiful and personally I felt this location and village much better than Barsu to trek up and down to Dayara. Even the trek is bit shorter than other places.  ,Maneesh M,/Profile/mkmittal1978,"Dehradun, India",50
