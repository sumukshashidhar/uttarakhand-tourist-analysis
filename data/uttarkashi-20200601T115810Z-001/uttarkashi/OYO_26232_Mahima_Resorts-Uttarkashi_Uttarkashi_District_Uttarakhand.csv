uttarkashi,"The hotel is located just after the town of Uttarkashi and so is in the quiet parts. There was good hot water, clean bed and towels, so for the budget, it was good. There is enough parking as well. I am sure when in season the hotel possibly will be more vibrant, otherwise our group was the only occupant. The hotel has a mess also which was activated just for us. The kitchen possibly could be cleaner, though I am sure in season when it is being used, it must be. The mess has some window panes which have not been placed, which possibly in summers must be acting as ventilation, but in winters it acted as cold draft inlet, which wasn't comfortable. They also put up a bonfire for us, which was nice. All in all, for a budget traveler, for an overnight stay, it is quite comfortable. A",Avinash_blr,/Profile/Avinash_blr,"Bengaluru, India",30
uttarkashi,"Good Food, Good Rooms and Good Staffs. Mahima Resort is the best place to stay if your are going to visit towards Gangotri. Mahima Resort is located at Netala just 7 Kms ahead of Uttarkashi. The Resort is neat and clean and a garden area in front. Strongly recommended for all.",rahulmukherjeehdrjwp,/Profile/rahulmukherjeehdrjwp,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50

uttarkashi,"Mahima Resort, Netala is an ideal stop over on the way from Yamunotri to Gangotri. Well maintained large size rooms with balcony overlooking the beautiful garden. Netala is about 11 kms from Uttarkashi towards Gangotri. Mahima can handle large groups as well as they have one more property right next Ekaant. Ample parking space. Food is good. Strongly recommended.",Kaustubh J,/Profile/60kaustubhj,"Zug, Switzerland",40
