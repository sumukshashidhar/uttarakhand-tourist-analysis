uttarkashi,"The camps are set amidst a beautiful garden with lovely flowers and greenery all around. The tents have 2 beds, a table, plastic chairs. Basic yet comfortable. The river is a short walk away. The food is excellent. There is only 1 TV in the main dining area that has Dish connection. There was running hot water in the camps.",Imrash,/Profile/Imrash,"Austin, Texas",40
uttarkashi,"We stayed in Camp Maneri on our way back from Gangotri. It is about the best place to stay on this route, although the next day journey to next destination, i.e. Kedarnath is rather long. The camp is of the basic character of all leisure hotel camps, two single camp cots, one side table, one fan and 2 plastic chairs. Washroom were good with steaming hot water, though if the boiler made less noise, we would have slept peacefully an extra hour. Food is really good and service good. The bonus is of it being on the banks of river bhagirathi as it flows from gangotri. Water is icy cold and having a bath in peak summer was like giving yourself an electric shock, but the afterward feeling is worth it. It suffered from the same disadvantage of offering no accommodation to the drivers",sattalbird,/Profile/sattalbird,"Gurgaon District, India",40
