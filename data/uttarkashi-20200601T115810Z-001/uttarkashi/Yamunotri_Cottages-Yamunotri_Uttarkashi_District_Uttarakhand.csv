uttarkashi,"Pleasantly surprised to find Cottages/Swiss tents with all latest amenities at such an altitude in a remote and scantily populated Himalayan range. Cozy rooms, Running Hot Water, Delicious Hygienic Food, Nice View, Beautiful camping area, Travel & Palki/Pony facilities.... can't ask for more!!",Meander827470,/Profile/Meander827470,,40
uttarkashi,"Yamunotri Cottages is located next to Helipad about 50 meters away. It is the best stay that you can have while visiting the Yamunotri dham. Hotel provides hot water facility, dining facility and cozy rooms. Rooms are just OK. Palki facility is arranged by hotel for Yamunotri dham and it is recommended to have one. Only BSNL network works here.",P K,/Profile/pkteotia,India,40
uttarkashi,We had made booking with Yamunotri Cottages and made advance payment almost a month ago of Check In. The Hotel was well aware about the water pipe damage and still did not make the repairs. It was a group of approx 21 people. There was no water at the Hotel. If the Hotel cannot maintain itself whats the use of operating such Hotel. They could have made arrangements by providing water through water tanker or any other sources but none could be arranged. Our entire group faced lot of issues because of it. Poor Services. We would not recommend this property. Not at all worth the money paid.,motamayuri,/Profile/motamayuri,"Mumbai, India",10

uttarkashi,"Well! First of all of you will find my review a sheer contrast to what you see here by other travelers. So my disclaimer before you read on – “This is based on my personal experience and may be it was just one of the days where everything goes wrong”  It was an impromptu visit, not planned at all. I did not even make any reservations for any hotel/resort online because I was all in for trying my luck this time and wanted to explore as I go.  I spoke to the gentleman over the phone and agreed to stay in one of the newly constructed rooms for 4500 per night inclusive of breakfast and dinner. Looking at the room and the setting the price didn’t seem a lot and we readily agreed. I travel a lot and I think this is a bit over priced given it was not a peak season. (I travelled on 11th",shobhit singh,/Profile/shobhits484,,30
uttarkashi,"Yamunotri Resorts is the best available place to stay when you are to Yamunotri. This is located next to the Helipad at Kharsi (Jankichatti). In fact the helipad is in the front yard of the resort. The cottages are comfortable with twin bed, attached bathroom having running hot water. The food is excellent. The services are also excellent. The manager and boys take care of you as their personal guest. The winter temple of Yamunotri Devi and the ancient Shani temple are close. You can have a good view of the snow clad mountains from your cottage veranda.",SunilVasudevan,/Profile/SunilVasudevan,"Trivandrum, India",50
uttarkashi,"I stayed a couple of hours on several occasions at the property during chardham flights. Consisting of cottages and tents that overlook the Yamunotri valley right next to the helipad at kharsali village, the property stands out because of its location, beauty and surprisingly - the professional manner in which it is run. I'm told it has been built by a retired army officer and he actually has ex servicemen managing the property. The cottages and rooms are kept neat and clean. Spartan furniture I overlook because it's enough for such a remote location.  The staff is responsive to your needs - even managing to conjure up tasteful marvels in such a remote place.",sanjay_ska,/Profile/sanjay_ska,"Greater Noida, India",40
uttarkashi,"I wanted to go on a trip - away from the Humdum of Jaipur, away from the heat, was looking for a lot of greenery, the typical mountain getaway, was not too interested in the Road trip to a mountain so was inclined towards the chopper ride. Someone indicated Yamunotri and I hit Google-Baba and Bingo! I hit this first place when I typed helipad in addition.  It was god sent. Per habit, I am rather choosy in where I stay and what I eat. So I gave these guys a call and the response was professional. They have a tele to connect to and it works! The Delhi office was especially supportive. They also assisted me in making the chopper reservations! I was all set and rearing to go in just about 12 hours of planning. The shortest I have done for a getaway.  We lifted off from Dehradun and",Prashant1972,/Profile/Prashant1972,"Jaipur, India",50
uttarkashi,Very functional cottages with just the right facilities for nature lovers & pilgrims to Yamunotri.... Spectacular locale for nature lovers with great tracks and places to explore around the cottages ! At present the cottages primarily cater to pilgrims but this is a must stay stop for all nature and mountain lovers.... Cottages are functional in nature at present but I understand will be upgraded soon !,AlbertGurgaon,/Profile/AlbertGurgaon,Gurgaon,30
uttarkashi,"This is definitely one of a kind lodging in the whole of Uttarakhand. The location is absolutely spot on and brilliantly set. Its located right on the banks of the crystal clear Yamuna river and is surrounded by wonderful and picturesque valleys. The rooms are clean and well maintained, just what you'd expect in a good tent. There is a proper attached bathroom and hot water supply. The food is delicious and there is a wide array of choice. But the brownie points goes to its wonderful staff who were well behaved, courteous and took care of every little demands we put forth dutifully. Also, its just a stone throw away from a famous Tapt kund which is very well known for its purity and importance. Would advise a stay here if going to Yamunotri as it is located in close proximity",amarjeetmalik966,/Profile/amarjeetmalik966,"New Delhi, India",50
uttarkashi,I have been going to this Yatra for many years now and have been thinking as to why there is no decent accommodation to stay here. Finally this year we found this resort that has been recently opened very close to Helipad. I must say it is an excellent facility and run rather professionally by some army Col. I would strongly recommend the place for all Yatris.,Manoj-Keshwar,/Profile/Manoj-Keshwar,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
uttarkashi,"The resort is located well connected by the road and Air(by Helicopter Service) and is next to the only Helipad at Yamunotri. The staff is always smiling in such a remote area, providing excellent service at all times. The resort facilities are very good, with beautiful cottages and lovely swiss tents with a view that can beat your experience of Switzerland. With two rivers (Yamuna & Hirayabahu) flowing to the either side of resort and snow clad peaks, lush green mountains and stepping fields in the backgound, it is a wonderful experience. The food is excellent with a wide variety and special emphasis for Yatris for 'JAIN' food without onion/garlic. The families including children had a great time with a visit to the village where the famous 700 year old ""Shani Temple"" and The",Deekay897,/Profile/Deekay897,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",50
