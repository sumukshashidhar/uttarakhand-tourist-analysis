uttarkashi,"Its well located, close to the Gaurikund and other sights. Rooms are spacious (depending upon what you chose). But it gets really cold inside the rooms and they do not offer any heaters. We were here in May when Haridwar was at 40C. And the temperatures in Gangotri itself werent that low. (was 10C in the noon). But the room was chilled. Our room had a geyser, though there were others who complained that they didnt have hot water in their rooms. The rooms were a bit overpriced as a lot of it was vacant. They have a restaurant which is fairly nice, and had an excellent service. (the location is across a bridge on the other side of the river. seemed like a fair distance when we went. But on the return, it didnt feel like much)",Anand K,/Profile/F735JDanandk,,30
uttarkashi,"Very cooperative staff. Could do with some more heaters in this weather. Food has not many options but it is to be expected at that altitude. Some things can improve like electric points,better linen, non leaking taps etc",vinita k,/Profile/732vinitak,,30
uttarkashi,"The PROs......... 1) The rest house of GMVN is serenely located at the opposite bank of river  Bhagirathi very near to Suraj kund,away from the hustle and bustle of the left bank where the main temple and the markets are situated.Porter is compulsory for carrying your luggage to and from the hotel. 2) The main plus must be the very recently installed geysers in bathrooms as hot water is the lifeline in this high altitude,above 9000 ft. Sacred place. 3) The delux rooms(8 no’s.) costing about 2300 bucks each are spacious and the 1st floor ones are preferable. 4) The Hotel attendants are friendly and cooperative and valuable informations regarding Gomukh trek etc. can be obtained from them. 5) We visited in mid-September and found the place less populated being the off-season,and",Soutik H,/Profile/soutikh2015,"Kolkata, India",40
uttarkashi,"From 12th to 14th May, I have been in GMVN, Gangotri with my family comprising my father- 84 years old and other 6 members. It was a fantastic stay in the clean and spacious TRH premises, in vicinity of Gangotri temple while enjoying hospitality of super co operative staff.  We were on a trek to Goumukh while my parents were to move to GMVN, Uttarkashi in between. GMVN Gangotri team has helped them with every means- help them to reach local jeep stand, arranging share jeep, help them to catch it, give special instruction to driver to drop them at Uttarkashi. With out their help it would be a big mess. Salute the great helping spirit of Team GMVN, Gangotri. Incredible India!!!",parthapathfinder,/Profile/parthapathfinder,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50

uttarkashi,"We stayed at GMVN TRH Gangotri for nearly a week in the month of May 2018. My family of 4 and my in-laws. The rooms are spacious and decently clean, and the overall exterior of the buildings is pleasing. The kitchen and dining hall can do with some improvements of lighting, as well as some of the room flooring can do with repairs.  But most importantly we were very well served by all the staff - the manager Mr Suresh Panwar was extremely helpful in getting our bookings changed/arranged for our further travels. The kitchen staff helped my in-laws like a family when the four of us were away on a trek and there was unseasonal snow in Gangotri. Providing food in the room, hot water for drinking and general assistance was very much appreciated.  This part of Gangotri is much more",Amitabh K,/Profile/amitabhk2018,"Pune, India",40
uttarkashi,"As price of TRH is fixed (starts at Rs.800), it is best for season booking. Else in offseason, there are many cheap and better options available at throwaway prices (Rs.100-300). Plan on dates as soon as gangotri temple is open (April) and you will end up paying just 10% of what you pay in peak saeson (may-june). Though location wise it is perfect and near to all the walkable tourist spots. Gangotri is a small place therefore no attraction is far from any place you check in. There is an attached restaurant in TRH where prices are normal as compared to other places. Local places (for stay) in peak season might charge Rs.1000 min for the same hotel that charges Rs.100/per day in offseason.",HOMPRS,/Profile/HOMPRS,"New Delhi, India",30
uttarkashi,Located on other side of River amidst serene hill semi-forest area just next to equally peaceful Suryakund. View around Hotel was just a treat for eyes.  Food was good considering remoteness of place. Overall enjoyed my stay.,Amit S,/Profile/IndianOculus,"Noida, India",40
uttarkashi,"This property is situated across the river, on the way to Surya Kund. It is a quiet spot, far away from the busy street that leads to the temple. If you have elderly people then this may be a slight problem. The staff are friendly as always. They may not be the most efficient, but they make up for it with their warmth. The rooms on the upper floor are much better.",Siddhartha Biswas,/Profile/Siddharthabiswas,"Kolkata, India",40
uttarkashi,"The Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam Tourist Rest House at Gangotri is located amidst hilly location with River Ganga (Bhagirathi) flowing nearby. During my visit to Gangotri in Oct 2016,  have stayed at this TRH in Delux Room. The room was quite big, with very high roof, attached with a large sized bathroom. There are no geysers installed in the bathroom, as these are not allowed at Gangotri. As such hot water is a problem for taking bath. One has to request reception to provide hot water in the bucket for use. The TRH is at a picturesque location with thunderous flow of water at the river. The surya kund at Gangotri is just 50 m from the TRH. Even one has to cross the narrow river through iron bridge to reach the tourist rest house.",CsSharma,/Profile/CsSharma,"New Delhi, India",40
uttarkashi,"Unlike most of the GMVN properties,the rooms are not very big, Toilets were clean, too  much problem with Hot Water, Geysers are not there in any of the properties at Gangotri (as we were told), hot waters being supplied in Buckets, even there was scarcity of hot water after we returned from a Trek to Kedartal, overall it is okay for a night stay, nothing more",Anirban,/Profile/Anirban0302,"Kolkata, India",30
uttarkashi,"The GMVN TRH Gangotri is one of the best locations in Gangotri. High altitude trekking, mountain climbing or just summiting a peak, this place is one of the best rest / acclimatisation, rejuvenation area in Gangotri. Situated in very close proximity of the Suraj Kund and just about 25 meters from the ever singing holy Ganga.   The filling in the forms, registers at the check in ceremony at the front desk takes a huge amount of time after one is so tired at the end of the long and tiring drive from below or a trek from the mountains.       There is a restaurant situated on the ground floor in the TRH where you get all the basic food all times starting from tea at 05:00 am in the morning.

uttarkashi,"The tourist rest house is average and one of the least facilitated amongst other GMVN hotels in the state. Rooms are extremely basic and considering the fact that the electricity supply goes off several times during the day in Gangotri, they obviously do not have hot water facility in the bathroom and hence it is provided separately in buckets only in the morning.  In spite of visiting in the month of May, the weather in Gangotri was chilly and harsh but there was no facility of heaters at the rest house. Since it is a very old construction probably a stone structure, the walls and interiors of the building are a couple of degrees cooler than the temperature outside. This fact was confirmed to us by the in house staff as well. Due to this issue, no matter how long you stay",Poojak247,/Profile/Poojak247,"Mumbai, India",30
uttarkashi,One must remember that Gangotri is a place where you really have very little options for a nice cosy and comfortable stay. Keeping this in mind this option really meets all the requirements. Rooms are small but clean enough. Bathrooms are good. Room service is ok. Staff was very helpful.,Parthosarathi M,/Profile/ParthosarathiM,"Kolkata, India",40
uttarkashi,"Gangotri is such a magical place that it makes you forget the hardship of finding a decent place to stay for the night. The GMVN is not one of them. The rooms are specious, dirty, and cold. They provide blankets and you don't want to question when is the last time they were washed... There is no heating system and no hot water (this is standard, though, in Gangotri) although you can ask for hot water for 50 rupees. No CC are accepted. And no breakfast is provided. OUCH!

uttarkashi,"There isn't much accommodation to choose from in Gangotri, and this is probably your best bet overall. The room sizes are decent, and some rooms (e.g. the family suites) are HUGE. The décor is basic - blankets are thick and heavy, bed linen is basic but clean. Towels are really clean and changed/washed everyday. Don't expect hot running water (no geysers are allowed in Gangotri) - but they do supply hot water in buckets 6-10 am every morning. The staff is friendly and helpful. The food is basic but fresh and tasty - more expensive than other places you'll find on the temple street, but still pretty reasonable. Soundproofing is non-existent, so having a boisterous family next door can spoil your morning if they're getting the kids ready for an early morning exit. But then,",arigho57,/Profile/arigho57,"Hyderabad, India",40

uttarkashi,"This hotel is quiet a busy one. Infact busiest of all the GMVNs I have been to. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the hotel needs a bit of cleanup and maintenance. The price is higher for what you get. It's located about 200 metres from the main road and you have to climb stairs (up and down) to get to the hotel which means it is slightly difficult for old people, people with knee problems and luggage. The biggest advantage is that you can book the hotel online at GMVNs website which means you are not left guessing about your accommodation when you reach. A few metres from the hotel the Bhagirathi falls making a gorgeous roaring falls and there is seating arrangement for people to sit and enjoy the surroundings. Food is ok.",Amit G,/Profile/yatrasuru,"Bengaluru, India",30
uttarkashi,"Spent two nights here on 30th and 31st October. Travelled with my wife. Positives: Location. On the southern bank of the river Bhagirathi. Away from the crowd and nose of the market street. At the same time accessible to it over pedestrian bridge right in front of the property. Negatives: The property in perpetually in the shadow of a cliff. Hence cold during the entire day. In fact, the rooms are colder than outside! The property has 8 double bedded rooms and a dormitory. Renovation is on for additional rooms. Electric supply is intermittent. No hot water in the taps. Hot water is supplied in buckets on demand.

uttarkashi,"Situated at a good location in the small place of Gangotri. Property is OK, but as other GMVN properties, has little care for the guests. Highly reactive and lazy staff. You have to ask for everything. Bathroom looks clean, but does not function very well. Keeps leaking, taps open up in unexpected places, etc. Given that Gangotri is a very cold place, these issues that are otherwise minor, can cause big irritations. Other properties in Gangotri that may not be bigger or better looking, offer more value for money and customer focus. Not sure, if I visit this property again.",jpnagar,/Profile/jpnagar,"Bengaluru, India",30
