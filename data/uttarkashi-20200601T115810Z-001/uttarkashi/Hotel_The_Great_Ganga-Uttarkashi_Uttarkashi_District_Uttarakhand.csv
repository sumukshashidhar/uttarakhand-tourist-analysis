uttarkashi,Excellent Rooms with all the amenities. Courteous staff with memorable river view. Experience which can never be forgotten. You can hear the sound of water flowing in the river from your room. Lovely lawn and excellent restaurant. What else can one expect.,Aniline3,/Profile/Aniline3,"Mumbai, India",50
uttarkashi,Worst place to live with no one there to listen. So called manager would merely be seen at reception and would sometimes find in kitchen making food. Food quality n' taste is even worst. No one would be there to clean your room. It's totally waste of money. Blankets were very old n' dirty n' manager was not ready to change them.,P Sharma,/Profile/P_sharma94,,10
uttarkashi,"It's a terrible hotel, you will get only room that would also be in messy n' dirty type. Food is even worst as it could be. Dishes are as dirty as they were years old n' kept without cleaning. There is no one to server you or listen you can keep on pressing reception ring but no one will show up. Never go for this hotel.",John,/Profile/john_solo25,,10
uttarkashi,Its a descent hotel with clean and spacious rooms. The taste of the food is acceptable but the variety is nice. We had booked a room which was had a river facing. It has independant cottages also. The manager was very helpful. Staff is okay. Medical store is just a km away which proved to be a boon.,Archana B,/Profile/445archanab,,30
uttarkashi,This hotel is 5km from Uttarkashi Enroute to Gangotri on the banks of the mighty Bhagirathi. The location is awesome and rooms are clean with clean bathrooms. The rooms are also air conditioned. However the service can improve. The dinner is delayed. Breakfast will not be available if you want it packed for early departure for Gangotri. With some minor improvements this is a great place on the banks of the river.,Harishuv29,/Profile/Harishuv29,"Mumbai, India",30
uttarkashi,This hotel is on main highway from Rishikesh to Gangotri in Distt Headquarters Uttarkashi. In a small place which has tourist season for just 3 months. They have lot of parking space This hotel is pretty good. The check-in was quick and smooth.The staff is courteous but not professional. The service was a bit slow but food was good and it is vegetarian hotel. The view of Ganges river just behind the Hotel is beautiful.  The room was net and clean and bathroom was also neat and clean. Would love to stay again. Lovely place to relax.,Sudhir J,/Profile/SudhirJ_12,"Saharanpur, India",40
uttarkashi,The hotel location is excellent. It is just on river bank and we can go on backside and enjoy river water. The biggest problem is of service. The restaurant is pathetic. The breakfast is hopeless. Dinner is average. Most unhygenic condition to eat food. The rooms are dirty and not cleaned. The bathrooms are pathetic.,tushar modi,/Profile/trm318,"Pune, India",30
uttarkashi,"The hotel was booked by our travel agent. We stayed in their newly constructed Cottages (the work is still being carried on). Rooms were clean, but the smell of fresh door paint was too much for us. It's adjacent to Alakannda river, so the view was beautiful. Okay food.

uttarkashi,Lovely hotel situated on the banks of the holy river  Ganges We travelled from Shimla and had a friendly welcome by the Hotel staff The panoramic view from the Hotel added more excitement to our stay at this hotel We spent day visiting the ashram and the holy temples along the river Ganges We were pleased the tour was organised by Destino India Tours who took care of us during this enjoyable stay  ,Anand S,/Profile/AnandS1875,,50
uttarkashi,This hotel was booked by tour operator. The hotel is on highway and on bank of River Bhagirathi. We had river facing rooms after arguing with the care takers. Nothing like hotel except the name. It is like Dharmashala with only bed facility. For everything even for hot water one has to pay.,babita13,/Profile/babita13,"Jaipur, India",30
uttarkashi,"The hotel is away from the city and right on the banks of Ganges. The rooms have  LCD TV sets and 6 inch mattresses. So the rooms are highly priced (Rs.3,700/night). And all the good ends there. The hotel is not managed by professionals but by young local untrained boys.  There is nothing to do after coming back to hotel - cable or wifi of the hotel does not work. Food is brought from the city so it is almost always late and cold. Cleaning of rooms happens after 4 pm. Young boys (14-15 years) who are staff, run around in the lobby disturbing guests.  The pathetic service at the hotel does not justify the rates.",Mallika231,/Profile/Mallika231,"New Delhi, India",10
uttarkashi,"The hotel The Great Ganga is situated on main road at Uttrakashi. A very basic hotel and on back side Ganga flows . The hotel runs only in season of Yatra . It has very few people to serve as traffic is very low, it has restaurant and serves good food .",rbs02,/Profile/rbs02,"Indore District, India",30

uttarkashi,"This hotel is on the river bank of Ganga, which beautifies this property even more. After searching all the hotels in Uttarkashi this hotel is the best amongst all, from its Ganga view balconies to the amazing room service. From its tradition food to its cleanliness in kitchens and dining area. From parking area to the spacious garden. My experience to 4 Cham Yatra was even more glorious with this charming hotel .. A personal experience and I suggest everyone to visit this hotel ! ",shobhal435,/Profile/shobhal435,,50
uttarkashi,"The maintenance of the property is so terrible that the hotel looses charm of its existence. The property is run by a family and like a baniye ki dukaan. The kitchen is filthy and so is the cook.  The drivers sleeping area is in one section of the dining hall, cordoned with a curtain. The wash are near the dining hall is pathetic - no words to describe the filth  and dirt. The dining hall is filled with house flies swarming all the tables, cutlery, food Ugh...........  The problem with these places is that the owners are interested only in making money. I am sorry to disagree with the travelers who reviewed the place. Horrible place is not the word.",Tempotraveller,/Profile/Tempotraveller,Bangalore,10
uttarkashi,it is a good hotel.clean and quiet.near the Gang river.the staffs are very nice and helpful.there is a spa but you should pay for it at least about $15 . the breakfast is ok but not      much options. Twice we ordered  indian food and it was very good.,Zari H,/Profile/zariM_12,Tehran,40
uttarkashi,"We were coming back from a 4 day trek in the Himalayas. The Great Ganga with its hot water, perfectly working ACs and clean bathrooms was like mana from heaven. Like a well oiled operation we are smoothly checked in. Never saw a manager, owner on the premises...  It seemed the staff were empowered to deliver to our basic requirements without the usual checking from the big Daddies.  We enjoyed great North Indian food at the hotel and will urge all guests to give it a try. Though all should be forewarned that it is a completely vegetarian establishment, where even eggs are not allowed.  It is located within walking distance from the ram  jjhula area.  It's only drawback is that the Ganga can be seen from the balconies only.   Regards",ZonkedP,/Profile/ZonkedP,"Mumbai, India",40
