champawat,"I stayed at the hotel for two nights and three days and booked three rooms. The feedback is based on that.  Location: Right on the road towards Mukteshwar, in Chipa, the hotel can be easily found. If you've hired a taxi, give the hotel's name as ""Pailaag"" as its the old name of the hotel and old drivers might recognize it with the old name, not the new one.  The hotel: A small hotel, two rooms wide and three floors down. In total, they have 10 rooms, I guess. Two on the top floor, and four on -1 and -2. The hotel is surrounded by an Apple orchard, which is the primary income and focus of the owner. The hotel isn't the focus and seems neglected.  The surrounding area is quiet and there's very less traffic on the road.   Facilities and Amenities: The hotel has a restaurant, not in",duvD,/Profile/duvD,delhi,30

champawat,In case you are looking for something away from the crowd...this is a good option.  Good things:  Away from the city Good food. They will cook what you want. Need to inform them in advance so that they can get the required stuff from the nearby market. Homely taste with good flavours. Try any non-veg curry. Helpful staff. Manager: Listen to you and act accordingly. Cook: Takes your preference seriously. Support staff: In case I am not wrong his name was Anil. A very helpful young lad. Always ready to serve as per your requirement. Good view: They have 4 rooms facing the valley and 4 I guess non facing. You which one to choose. A place for Bonfire Enough parking space for 3-4 cars  Not so Good things:  Very limited snacks. I should say very very limited. No Market nearby.
