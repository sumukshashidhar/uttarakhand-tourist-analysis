champawat,"Our experience right from the reservation was a thoroughly professional one. Their website is amazing and there are brilliant videos of each suite so that travellers can make up their mind well in advance. All their rooms have enchanting names such as Bliss, Nirvana, Secret Garden, etc.   We decided to stay in ‘Nirvana’ as it had a private balcony and a massive window with amazing views.  They have a quaint, bright dining room and a common area with a fire place which we used. There are a lot of open seating areas with sweeping views of the valley and the Himalayan range.   We were lucky enough to encounter hail the day we reached and the children had a a great time making a snowman.

champawat,Going to Soulitude in the Himalayas was a long time dream. We were hoping for great views. We got that certainly. The picture windows overlooking the Nanda Devi range are fantastic. We could see them even from our bed in Joy. But  the hospitality matches the view. The lunch laid out on a sunny day in the balcony so you could eat while looking at the peaks. The bonfire at night. The elaborate meals were tasty and fresh. Hills do get cold and unlike many hill stations these rooms come with a good sized heater and heated beds. So you were never cold in the room. I just wish they allowed you to light a fire in the fireplaces in the room. That would have been super.

The hotel is literally clinging to the mountains, offering a stunning view of the Himalayas. It's ideal for guests looking for a relaxing experience, inspiration or reflection.  I was also impressed by how accessible it was. In my case, I took a train from Delhi to Kathgodam and after that a taxi drove in little less than 2 hours.  The Soulitiude was fabolous in all aspects. Food was self-service, with the possibility of ordering certain dishes. It was tasty, fresh and local.

Secondly - this is among the few places where we were bowled over by the sheer hospitality - which cuts across all of the staff.

They do not have a television in the room. In case you want to see television you need to come out in the common area where there is TV and then you can watch it. They have fixed buffet for breakfast lunch and dinner. Lunch is 600 rs. and Dinner is 750 rs. per pax. Breakfast was complimentary. Although the spread is not elaborate but sufficient. There is a common area where every guest can come and sit and play games. They also have a small library. They also have a collection of DVDs in case one wants to watch movies.

Actually the place was built by that idea initially by its owners, am told, who later thought of converting it into a getaway, (hotel- wouldn't be the right word for it). The rooms are all individually done and have quite an English feel to them in terms of interiors and decor. Even the non- suite rooms are large enough to be called ""suites"" at other hotels.

We chose Soulitude because Ramgarh was an easier drive for us from Kathgodam for a 3 day break as compared to making the hike up to Binsar.

Every room has a grand view, with large picture windows and a lot of natural light. Each room is also different, which enhances the homely feeling of the place. It's wonderfully located as well, actually before the Ramgarh market and at a perfect altutude, which keeps the temperature cool and nice.

We arrived at the Kathgodam railway station in the morning and took the taxi to the resort. The taxi service (Mr. Nafees) was suggested by the property owner Mr. Manish and we found it to be worth the advice as hill journeys can be troublesome especially in rainy seasons.

We walked into the property and just went WOW. The esthetics of the place perfectly blend into the surroundings, natural wood, stone and ivy created a magical picture.The back drop of snow capped mountains with lots of open walk abouts was beautiful.The cute fire places with the crackle of wood added to the charm.

Very nice and bright colors have been used. The best part is that the living room and the bliss room have glass ceiling. You  can literally gaze the stars in the night.   The food is amazing, specially Sham Singh's butter chicken and his sizzler's.   Excelent place to go uphill is Devi Mandir.

champawat,Our Holiday at the Soulitude was as perfect as it can get ! The most amazing thing was as if we had gone to a friend's place who is so keen to show us around and also to pamper us !!  There is no doubt that the place has an extremely scenic location and it is perfectly done up. Every little detail has been thought of......every nook and corner has a story to tell. It is a treat for the eyes to feast on the detailing around.  We stayed in the room called Quietude which had stairs going up to a bed for our 9 year old son. It was really thrilling for him to be up there. There is no TV in the rooms which suited us perfectly. However we di have a laptop with us and some favourite movies of our son. So all 3 of us ended up cozying up in his bunk bed and watched Ratatouille. All this,SonaliMehta,/Profile/SonaliMehta,"New Delhi, India",50

However, having already visited much hyped Shimla and Kullu Manali and largely disappointed, we had pretty much washed our hands off another ""hill-station"" vacation. When we started checking out relaxing getaways close by to take a break from whirlwind vacations, Soulitude came to mind. It was certainly well connected and the Delhi heat was the last push needed to convince ourselves to take another chance.  We stayed at Soulitude for four nights with a group of like minded friends.

With Manish not being there on this visit, will it turn out to be a different experience, perhaps not as good?

It is one of those rare places where the actual experience is much better than what was projected on their website. I happened to stumble upon this place quite accidentally ; my husband and I were the ‘last minute planners’ and didn’t want to visit the ‘usual’ holiday getaway places  around Delhi namely Shimla, Mussorie, Nainital etc. The place looked amazing online and for the 1st time, I was looking forward to the resort stay more than the destination itself.

The wonder at the views is followed up with excitement at seeing lush green hills covered with unimaginably thick forests.  Soulitude's own garden is a treat. The joy of plucking a fresh ripe Plum and Peach for yourself had become things of the past. Here you can relive that wonderful experience.

We saw that the rest of the hotel was totally empty but despite our repeated request to change our room to one of the bigger ones, nothing was done. On speaking to Manish, he told us that he was expecting some VIPs two days later so the rooms needed to be prepared. However, even though we checked out at 11 after two nights, there was no sign of any other guest.   The staff was totally disinterested and unmotivated.

What stands out about Soulitude is that it’s not just a fantastic resort to holiday in but that it actually makes you feel that you are staying at home. The place has been lovingly conceptualized and painstakingly executed by Manish Chandra. The rooms afford you breathtaking views of the imposing Himalayas and the sight of the beams of the rising sun bathing the imposing Nanda Devi peak in pink and gold is an unforgettable one. Manish himself is hospitality personified and we were really fortunate to be staying at Soulitude at the same time as he was down there with his warm and affectionate family who went out of their way to make us feel at home.

Basically great views with Spartan living. My holidays at Soulitude changed everything. And I am saying  ""holidays"" because ever since I first stayed there in may 2007 .. I have been back every single year with my kids, friends and family.

The wooden floors, wooden slant ceilings, wrought iron stoves, clear glass skylights are all class apart.  Staff: The staff at the property is very well trained and very helpful and cheerful.
