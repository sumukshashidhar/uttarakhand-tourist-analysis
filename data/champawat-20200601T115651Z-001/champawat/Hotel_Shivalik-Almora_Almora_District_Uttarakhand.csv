We reached to the bifurcation from where the hotel is about 10 minutes on foot and less by vehicle but had to encircle almost the whole place to get there because of the one way thing, quite upsetting really!  As said already, it is a good hotel near the Nanda Devi Temple amidst the market. Vishal Mega Mart is just off it.  View from the balcony is beautiful, simply beautiful.

The biggest con of the hotel is that it is on an elevated section of the road which diverts from the Mall Road. Given the weird regulations governing traffic in Almora, it means that one will need to walk up from the corner of the Mall road to reach this hotel most of the times during the day. This could post a problem to senior citizens of those who are not comfortable with inclines of hills.  I reached the hotel at around 1030 AM.
