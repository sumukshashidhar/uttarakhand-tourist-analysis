They have many rooms and a big parking lot as well. There is no separate place for Drivers in case you take one along with you. Food is good and their spread of breakfast / dinner is great.

champawat,"They call it 'giving control to the customer' - but the self-service concept is taken a bit too far. The staff is completely unconcerned.   I checked-in early morning (5:53 to be precise).  What do I get when I enter my room - The bed-sheet has stains. I asked for a cup of coffee - it took half an hour to get the same and even then, the cup of coffee was chipped. The laundry rate card says ""the hole is not responsible""!!   I was not informed of early check-in rates. And guess what, the rates change at 06:00 hrs... I am informed of this only at the time of check-out. And what is more, instead of simply accepting an error, the person at the reception desk claims I checked-in at 05:00!  The saving grace is perhaps the restaurant which is decent.  The place is around 4-5 KMs from",Puneet A,/Profile/PuneetA_11,"Mumbai, India",20

However, the cake is not so fresh.",WaiKeen,/Profile/WaiKeen,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",30
champawat,I stayed in this hotel in November 2011. This hotel is very good. Room is very neat and clean. Slight noise of AC was observed at the time of check in and before I say anything the manager gave me another room. Room has all required amenities and good shower facility in bathroom. One advantage of this hotel is that they are providing complementary pick up and drop facility at airport as well from railway station. staff is very cooperative. However you may have problem with your food choice as there is very small menu. Overall hotel is good.,jalendu2,/Profile/jalendu2,Mumbai,40
champawat,Rooms are ok but Restaurant is horrible in terms of food quality and options available. Hotel is in city outskirts. I found other places like Hotel Rudra Continental better than Ginger.

champawat,"as previous reviewer stated the rooms are tired, this can be expected, but after a transfer flight to Delhi and an 8 hour horror drive you do not want to stand at reception for hours whilst 2 of 3 staff wander around, looking bored. When we finally got to the rooms the aircon was louder than a jet engine and three phone calls later finally got another bored looking member of staff who started adjusting the telly. Finally changed rooms to one whose aircon only sounded like an A380.  The free wifi was unavailable for our 4 nights with a different excuse every day The 4 staff at breakfast were to interested in the telly to clean covers and serve people, I only wanted a coffee and each morning it got worse waiting up to 30 minutes, what a pity the in house coffee shop did not open",overseas_engineer,/Profile/overseas_engineer,"Salford, United Kingdom",10

TV does not work in few rooms, but nobody bothers. Check in may take few hours also. Need really a significant improvement.  Good thing, compared to other Gingers is quality of bed. Bed does not slip here and there.",anilkumawat,/Profile/anilkumawat,Gurgaon,20
champawat,"The hotel is at the entrance to the Pantnagar Industrial Estate and is therefore ideal for people visiting nay of the factories there. That is where its positives end. Rooms are tiny, bathrooms basic, maintenance is shoddy, staff indifferent, food is terrible... one could go on and on about the hotel's problems. There are plenty of locally run hotels which would be much better - and the distance is not a big enough advantage here.",hedgefund007,/Profile/hedgefund007,"Belmont-sur-Lausanne, Switzerland",10

champawat,"What you pay for is what you will get at Ginger. At decent room rates, this no frills offering is located right at the entrance of the Industrial Zone at Pantnagar/Rudrapur. You can book the rooms online and there is an option with Breakfast complimentary.  Like all Ginger hotels, you will have to manage your own luggage and haul it upto your room. Rooms are fairly basic and small in size with very little moving space. There is a small working table next to the bed. The washroom area is decently sized, but not very clean though. You can have their set buffet for dinner or buy some stuff off Cafe Coffee Day which is located in the lobby. There is a very threadbare Gym with a Treadmill which works and a Cycle which does not.  Other downsides were stained Bedsheets and really old",Ketan M,/Profile/kemo0910,Gurgaon,30
champawat,if you are visiting rudrapur / pantnagar often for business- Ginger is certainly a great choice. All basic services from food & taxi to internet are crisp. You'll find it very nifty as it is very close to the Rudrapur industrial center,a-nike1234,/Profile/a-nike1234,Mumbai,50
champawat,"Overall stay was good and wonderful in some aspects as well as bitter in some more. The best part was it was clean and neat because of no room service / no clatter of people.  The wonderful part was a self use cloth iron installed on each floor for  convenience, even a since fold on your shirt get it cleared own your own . Other hotel think twice, call for house keeping and he takes another 15 minutes with lots of if and buts in the morning  The bad part was as they are not tune to room service. A self made tea system is installed in all the rooms and it is difficult and tough to get a extra sachet of tea bag etc in 1 hour or so   Over all experience first with Ginger group was good",Nitin1208,/Profile/Nitin1208,"Ahmedabad, India",40
champawat,Decent hotel for business travellers. But it is expensive f you don;t have corporate offers. The rooms are small compared to other gingers and the beds are also small. This being one of those initial gingers the infrastructure is not inline with new gingers. If you have corporate discounts then this will be the best hotel in that location.,Meghnath,/Profile/Meghnath,Mumbai,50

It is located somewhat away from the Pantnagar / Rudrapur town and if you are the type that likes to explore the town that you stay in, you would have to retain your vehicle or make necessary arrangements beforehand.  The hotel is a neatly maintained property having all basic amenities you would expect from a no frills business hotel. The LCD TV and the gym are two exceptions to the basic no-frills nature of the hotel. The hotel does not have room service as is the norm with Ginger hotels. They do provide complimentary buffet breakfast at the ground floor restaurant. The restaurant also has a buffet dinner which is the only option in the vicinity. The buffet was reasonably priced for the menu",Biju Nair,/Profile/BijuNair,"Daman, India",40
champawat,A typical no frills hotel. but have all the basics right like neat rooms and neat hotel. good bathroom and a working and quiet AC. The LCD TV was a delightful surprise. The location was perfect for us as our factory is just 5 min drive from this hotel and this was the best part of this hotel The food i.e the breakfast and lunch was disappointing  but the buffet style meant you could have a quick meal. Low service component does strike out like having to fetch your drinking water. It reminded me of Engineering college hostel.,vjmstry,/Profile/vjmstry,mumbai,40
