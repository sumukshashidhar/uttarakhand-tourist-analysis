champawat,"One of my friends recommended me to stay in golden peak at Mukteshwar. It was really an amazing experience staying at the hotel. Undoubtedly Staff was really good at services. Everything, from food to location was superb. NO CHANCE of any complaints. When my friend told me about the hotel I saw the reviews and I was shocked on reading the review of 9th June and after that I even thought to cancel the reservation but as it was my friend’s recommendation I had to stay there and after my stay I was so so happy with everything. Thank God I didn’t cancelled my reservation. I would also like to suggest you to try this hotel if you are planning to visit MUKTESHWAR.",Atul,/Profile/Goelatul99,,50
champawat,"This hotel has everything what you can expect from a hotel in Mukteshwar like small areas.  Decent room size, clean washrooms, garden area, kids play area, valley view, tasty food etc. You won't find all such facilties at such price in Mukteshwar. I searched a lot of hotels and then selected this hotel and I was not wrong.  My stay was excellent.(I booked valley facing rooms as they are much better) It is just 5 kilometres from main tourist points like chauli Ki jali and Mukteshwar temple.  Though it is a small newly built hotel, may be around 20 rooms, managed by a family, but still they provide best possible services. Terrace garden is also very good. Also they can manage parking facility for around 10 to 15 cars.  ",Karan K,/Profile/Z5289BOkarank,,50
champawat,"Warm, friendly small hotel on the main road leading up to Mukteshwar. Ideally located not too far away from the centre and still away from the hustle bustle.  Rooms are decent sized and clean. The staff is very cordial and attentive. Food is simple and delicious. It is made to order only as we went in the off-season.  Can cook up Kumaoni cuisine on request. Try to get the outside room with a balcony seating as it offers the best views. Parking could be a problem if all rooms are full so check up on that.",kushalyadav,/Profile/kushalyadav,"New Delhi, India",40
champawat,"This is one of the pathetic hotel in mukteshwar to spend your holidays at. Pathetic service, pathetic response from staff, there wasn't any electricity at the hotel with no hot water. Even if they claim to have back-up, trust me they don't have. Don't even dare to go to this pathetichotel which will make your stay most miserable ever!!",Anjali N,/Profile/Happiness527290,,10

champawat,"No hotel in Mukhteshwar can beat Golden peak. The hotel is situated near the falls, comes with a great view of the valley and the village life. All the dishes, both snacks and main courses were delicious. The stuff members are extremely helpful and always there with smiling faces.  The rooms are very comfortable, comes with all the amenities. Finally, the room charge is nothing compared to other hotels.  Ten out of the ten times, I will go for this hotel.

champawat,"I booked 4 rooms in this hotels and they put all on the same floor, which was highly appreciated. The people are genuinely interested to serve you their best hospitality and to make the trip memorial. Rooms are well organized and bathrooms are super clean with beautiful balcony views of double deluxe rooms. The food(paranthas recommended) is also great which was helpful as there was no restaurants nearby. They provide accommodation for the driver along with free food.The services was quite efficient and we loved the bonfire and barbecue. And all this at much affordable prices. So, don't think twice before booking this hotel, you can count on this one.",Atishay J,/Profile/AtishayJ28,,50

champawat,"I trusted the reviews and booked a room. The experience turned out to be nightmare. First they cheat and then they fight with you. A man in the management was almost ready to beat me up.   They don't have a proper parking, they will keep on asking for your car keys. The car parks on a slanting pavement, that will damage suspension. They didn't confirmed the booking price, I got it all inclusive of the taxes, however they denied it and asked me to pay the taxes extra. As I was sitting, there was another person getting billed before me, he paid with taxes included.   In the restaurant, I asked them to get me the bill for verification, they denied it. I asked them all the time we had food, but they denied it every time. At last, they overcharged me by showing extra numbers. In the",shishirmba,/Profile/shishirmba,"Noida, India",10

champawat,"This is undoubtedly the best hotel in Mukteshwar. Managed by a very loving family, the hotel has all the luxurious amenities of the best quality. Their food is awesome, specially chicken biryani, paneer, black pepper chicken and dal. The view of the sunrise and the Naina devi mountains from the bedroom itself is out of this world. The owner himself organises a trek to the waterfall which takes you to another world. Mukteshwar also has a night safari. The place needs to be promoted as it is the best hill station in Kumaon region. Quaint, quiet and beautiful. Overall one of my best holiday experience.",Anupamrajkhowa,/Profile/Anupamrajkhowa,"New Delhi, India",50

champawat,"Visited the golden peak in July 2016. Stayed there for 3 nights. I had one of the best days of my life. The scenic beauties from the room is breathtaking . The staff is very responsive and helps you for everything.  I visited mukteshwar for the first time and stayed in one of the best hotels I have ever visited. The food of the restaurant is just amazing. Do try dal makhani, shahi paneer, cheese omlette, grilled sandwich.  The owners are very helpful. It is a must stay. Though they also have a wonderful garden",Ishaan B,/Profile/IshaanB24,,50
