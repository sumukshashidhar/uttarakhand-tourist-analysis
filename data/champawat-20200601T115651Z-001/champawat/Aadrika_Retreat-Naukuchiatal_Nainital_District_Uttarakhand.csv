champawat,"The hotel is great place to stay with owsome lake views, delicious food and descent rooms. The owner Piyush Jain personally take care of the guests requirements. Staff is quite responsive in quickly attending any needs. The place very near to boat point and all adventure sports available in Naukuchiatal. Highly recommended for couples who wants a quite stay for relaxation. One can easily visit nearby places as day trips.",navin,/Profile/navseema,"New Delhi, India",50
champawat,"Stayed for 2 nights.. property is nice exactly as shown in pictures. It has a great view of naukuchiataal.Rooms are well maintained, rooms with balcony are smaller as compared to non balcony room but has good view of lake.  Non AC rooms become bit hot during day as sunlight directly falls on room. Common sitting area( terrace) is big and good.We enjoyed spending time at terrace together with music and all. Food is delicious and quantity is also  good.Property has parking space.Ms.Kanchan at hotel office takes good care of guest. Staff is humble and prompt in service.  Room charges could be lower. Overall nice experience.",Sana Hasan,/Profile/Sanahasan,,50
champawat,"An average place with average rooms. Location is good. Rooms are lake facing, service is good and food is nice. cleanliness was a problem. And we faced electricity problem. No staff was available on the reception on arrival.Rooms had insects and spider. Bathrooms were not clean. Pillow covers were dirty and blankets were without covers. The rooms and resort pics displayed on sites is done professionally photographed but actual experience is totally opposite. Booked this resort seeing the luxury of pics but actual feel was average. Bathrooms had no fresheners also so stinked. Only salvage was the room view and the food. Electricity is a problem in this area. Would recommend to check if the place has generator backup. This place has inverter backup so can't matchup to requirements",Pvyasbuzz,/Profile/Pvyasbuzz,,30

champawat,"The Hotel is a good , with ample and good amenities. The location is a 5 star rated with a beautiful view of the Naukuchiatal lake. The balcony sitting is nice one where you can relax and listen to some great music played by the hotel.  The restaurant serves you one of the finest creation of Kumaoni Cuisine . Not to forget the placed is cool and withing the nature. Over-all recommended. Special Mention to Mr Shikhar and his colleagues who took really great care of us .

champawat,"We were a group of 8 and an infant. We did want to go for Lake resort but since it was way too expensive; we check the reviews for Aadrika and booked the same. I am glad that reviews were correct. This is neither a resort nor a spa but a fabulous option to stay. The resort is located just in front of the lake and you would get good lake views from all the rooms. It is not a huge property with 6 rooms in total. Try getting a room on Second floor (4 of them) for better views. Rooms were clean, good enough for 2, nicely illuminated and came with balcony. The bathrooms were clean. We wanted to have couple of drinks in the open and the management took excellent care of that. The snacks were  delicious with veg Manchurian and chilly checkout of the world. Since we also had an infant",Saurabh G,/Profile/saurabhg947,"New Delhi, India",50
champawat,"The location of the property is amazing. Bang opposite the lake You get cool breeze flowing throughout the day. You can spend the whole day sitting by the lake. The owner is hospitable enough. He is a good guide of the place and knows the area. The food at the hotel is delicious  particularly chicken do pyaza, mix veg and garlic chicken, but they are a bit overpriced when you compare them with restaurants around. We tried the Lake Cafe for a day at the entrance of the lake and that is heaven.    The staffs are nice. However they aren't happy if you dont tip them well. This one guy, who is the chief, was happy to help. But then while leaving the place he was pissed and annoyed as we paid Rs 100 as tips, which he was clearly not happy about.

champawat,"Naukuchiatal is undoubtedly one of the prettiest lakes in Uttarakhand and this beautiful resort ensures that your visit to the taal remains an indelible experience. We stayed here for two nights in the 'Oak Pine' room. The room was a cosy, little nest, replete with all the necessary amenities. All the rooms in the resort face the lake and you can spend your entire evening in the attached balcony while soulful music plays at the open dining area below. The staff were extremely courteous and hospitable. I was suffering from a blocked nose and there were no medical shops nearby. So, one of the staff escorted my partner to the nearby medical practitioner's place to get the medicine. The food items, though a little expensive, were delicious.    All in all it was a wonderful stay and",Sulagna D,/Profile/SulagnaD17,,50

champawat,"Good location/ Close to Nature/ Clean/Doable in weekend (from Delhi)/ Reasonable  A very cute little pet friendly resort with only few rooms, all facing the silent lake of naukuchiatal. Provides ample space to party or play whatever you like. The staff was good and food was better than our expectations. We visited the place during off-season and I would say the tariff was reasonable. Another good thing is even during off-season the spa facility was available and that too at a very low price. However we could not afford ample time for the massage but would love to go there next time. The place is very close to Delhi. About 7 hours drive with normal traffic. The food service was slow probably because they prepare everything from scrap- starting right from buying the ingredients",Spardha Bisht,/Profile/spardhabisht,,50

champawat,"We had a great time at Aadrika Resort. The best part was the staff and management, they were so very helpful and made our stay a memorable one. The location is just out of this world and faces the Naukuchiya Taal. Looking forward to visiting again in November 2017. ",ikhanna,/Profile/ikhanna,"New Delhi, India",50

champawat,"Beautiful little hotel just across d road from d lake. small but nicely made lake facing rooms. Food is good n reasonably priced.. its just a month old property so there were little glitches here and there but the owner Piyush gracefully acknowledged it n worked around the resolution. The staff was courteous. The manager Mona was exceptionally good specially with the kids. She was even ready to babysit our 2.5 yr old while we went for paragliding. :)  A live music night was organised on d open lake facing terrace which made the stay even more fun n memorable.   Would any-day prefer a stay here than in any 5star property in nainital. It's so serene. Don't expect uber luxurious facilities. But for the price we paid in the peak season, it was basic but perfect!!   Overall a great",FellowTraveler618452,/Profile/FellowTraveler618452,,50
champawat,"We stayed in this newly built hotel in early May. They have six rooms which are overlooking the Lake. The rooms are spacious with balconies and very tastefully done. Breakfast (included in our package) was excellent. Both days we had dinner in the resort. Food rates are reasonable and I specially recommend dahi vala Chicken. Boating point is walking distance. Piyush Jain (Owner) is very helpful and along with the Manager Mona, he is managing the affairs of the hotel very well. We definitely want to come back to this hotel again.",AbhishekNDelhi,/Profile/AbhishekNDelhi,"New Delhi, India",50
