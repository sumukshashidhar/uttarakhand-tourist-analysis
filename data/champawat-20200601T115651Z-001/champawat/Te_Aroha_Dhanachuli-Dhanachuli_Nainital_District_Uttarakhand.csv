champawat,"Stayed for two nights with family. This hotel has all the amenities you would expect from any luxury hotel but what sets it apart is its staff and the food. Never before have I ever seen such helpful and friendly staff. Right from the person who carries the luggage upto your room to the amazing chef. The food served to us couldnt be any tastier. The winter snow, clear view of snow covered peaks like Nanda Devi and absolute calm environment were just some of the add-ons which made the stay an absolute delight.",KAS,/Profile/kaifahmed85,,50
champawat,The Kumaon range has a strange hypnotic effect on you and when you return back to the plains you will never be the same.when I first set foot on Te Aroha in a distant and lesser known Dhanachuli I had no idea that would put a spell on me .Coming back to the  property it is everything a mountain lover can wish for.i went in December for added measure because I truly feel the snow capped peaks are at their( to me they have a living entity) elemental best during winter and the small mountain village of Dhanachuli come alive with the sound and activities  of  everyday chores of mountain people and the different flora and fauna that the place has to order.

Upon arrival, after a long 8 hour drive, we were told that, since a deluxe room would require an extra bed, we were being upgraded, for free to a 'family suite', aka, The Guest House. It was a two bedroom suite, with one small dingy room and a large spacious, well-lit room, with a floor-to-ceiling window. It was very close to the cafe, which was both good and bad as everything we said and did in the balcony was easily seen from almost any part of the hotel.

Rooms: The rooms are neatly and comfortably done  with attention to little details. I was with my  husband and 6 year old dd. We stayed at the 'guest room' which was perfect for us. We had earlier booked the attic but the staff upon our arrival was kind enough to show guest room also which was available..after checking both the rooms we chose the guest room as it was more comfortable for us.

champawat,"Te Aroha The Place: The moment I heard I was heading off to the mountains it was a moment of truth and longing. I had heard of the breath-taking beauty and exotic cuisines of the mountains of Kumaon and of the valleys at the base of the Himalayan range close to Nainital, and I couldn’t wait for the moment when I would feast my eyes (and palate) on them. Dhanachuli lies ensconced at the very top of those hills… a tiny little place with hamlets all around, the stone houses reminiscent of a different era.  The winding hills of Kumaon and the Hills that hold the myriad towns (some still not featured on the map of India), are magical.

There is nothing special about the location, as it literally sits on the corner of the highway. The views of course are beautiful from the hotel rooms. But to call this a hotel would be a mistake. Te Aroha is an experience. It takes you into an era of colonial bungalows. Painstakingly designed with attention to minute details it stays true to its theme of “down the memory lane”.

We were upgraded to the Master's Bedroom, so we really had a great experience for the two nights that we were there.  All in all, a must-visit.",DGC Sekhri,/Profile/DGCSekhri,"New Delhi, India",50
champawat,"DhanaChuli is a 90 km ride from Bhimtal. A bit inwards but every bit worth it. Te Aroha is a fantastic dream come true for the traveller as it was for the owner. The place has some real nostalgic memorabilia collected by the owner. We had a wonderful 1 day trekking accompanied by the local travel guide arranged free by the Inn. The weather too cooperated with us. In the afternoon we played chess and watched some movies in the Inn's DVD entertainment room. They have a nice DVD collection. They have a exclusive POKER room too. The Manager Deven makes a beautiful Cappuccino, just as in Costa Coffe or Coffe Day. The AMBIENCE is the best.  I enjoyed every bit of it, but being the global traveller I am, my expectations were not met in 2 quarters.

champawat,"After reviewing a lot of properties in Uttrakhand I zeroed down to Te aroha. We enjoyed it thoroughly .I still have the beautiful memories of their beautiful and luxurious room,our own private terrace, restaurant with fantastic food,cafe flashback,recreation room(loads of books and movies to watch on only TV in the hotel),attic room,tea with cookies,the village trek and the most important thing...the silence with beautiful views(though Himalayas were not visible due to weather). Their staff is absolutely wonderful and will help you in every possible way with a warm and genuine smile.   All in all its a great place for people who wants to live luxury with views and do nothing except relaxing with nature.",AKB29,/Profile/AKB29,Delhi,50
champawat,"Te Aroha may attract you when have a look at the pics and read the reviews, but that's just a prelude. The property is mesmerizing; if you can afford a suite (preferably Master's Bedroom) then nothing like it. It's a perfect place to relax for a few days, unwind yourself, do nothing, eat well, flow with the ubiquitous silence, and lose yourself in the hills. The staff ensures you get all of this and more.   Te Aroha is clearly a work of passion by Sumant Batra, and it reflects in everything, right from welcome drink to the bathroom door handles to dining area! Perfect setting for a romantic holiday; elderly may struggle because of the large no of steps.   All in all, perhaps the best place I have been to in the hills. Heavily recommended.",HarshVardhan30,/Profile/HarshVardhan30,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",50
champawat,"We arrived at Te Aroha around 12 pm and where immediately brought to the room. All rooms are beautifully furnished, no unnecessary luxury but with a lot of taste. The lobby and the new Cafe Flashback are just stunning.  I have never experienced a better service as in this place. Tips are not favoured only at checkout for the whole team if you wish to do so. Therefore all the service is included and you can perfectly relax why the staff is spoiling you with there amazing ginger lemon team with fresh baked cookies, snacks or a hot water bag for the cold nights.  The food served for dinner in the restaurant was very delicious!  We were making a roundtrip through India and I booked the place to escape the rush and heat of Delhi for sometime.

champawat,"I had read a lot of good reviews about Te Aroha and was desperately waiting to take the plunge myself which happened this month. Barring my journey to and fro from the property there was not a minute thing which was out of place !! A fairy-tale house set in the picturesque and serene hills far from the madding crowd is what awaited me and my wife and the place will make you fall in love all over again !!! Excellent rooms, views, fabulous food, awesome service...I can go on and on about the wonder Sumant Batra and his team has created. Everything was perfect and not even a small thing went wrong during her 2 days stay. Its one of those places wherein you go to fall in love and forget all your worries ...I could live there forever and still can if Sumant employs me ;) Jokes apart,",Avidtraveller79,/Profile/Avidtraveller79,"New Delhi, India",50
champawat,"We were desperately seeking the cool of the hills in the summers of 2012 - each year we spend a few days away from the crowd and in the hills. Te Aroha was suggested by a friend and business colleague. We left Delhi at 0545 hours and after an endless journey (due to weekend traffic) reached there by sunset. The place is well located on a hill with a view of the peaks.   The lodge/hotel is a ten room property with each room being different and offering different levels of comfort, view etc. The rooms are very well appointed with oil heaters, hot and cold water, comfortable beds, reading material in the sit out rooms, cookies and fresh fruits etc. The staff are simply superb and the Sumant Batra an ex lawyer and his friend and partner Vivek were superb hosts.

The staff was very courteous, the welcome drink, the decor of the room, the dinner, everything was outstanding. The jungle walk & the village walk was again just amazing. We had been travelling with our friends for about 2 weeks, to different places, staying in different hotels. Sincerely Te Aroha stands out among all.

Lovely weather, good for quiet walks up the lane,  and the view is superb from the hotel. Truly a boutique hotel. It is commendable of the owner Mr. Sumant Batra, to get this lovely haven done up so well in the quaint and peaceful place called Dhanachuli.

Were pleasantly surprised  ... lovely location, nice rooms (each one is different), choice of cuisine... but as always for us it was the service that was the real differentiator ...  the team led by sumant himself made every effort to take super care of us and to customize every moment to what we wanted.

My vacation at Te Aroha is truly memorable.  Staying at Te Aroha ... I feel love is all around .... I feel peaceful with amazing view from Morning Sun Room....

champawat,I found this place an absolute heaven on earth!!! A lot of positive energy all around the place. I wanted to cut off myself for 2 days from the hectic schedule I had in Delhi and Te Aroha provided me that. The interior seemed to be done with lot of personal touch. The entire staff was well trained and courteous. They have a very good multicuisine restaurant with delicious food served every day. One more thing which thrilled me was the drive during our way back from Dhanachuli to Bhimtal. It was slightly raining and there were very few vehicles on the mountain road and driving was like...you are on a secret trip to find a treasure. All in all it was a wonderful trip with not a single moment of disappointment which is very rare these days while you stay in hotels.,Vishwajeet R,/Profile/VishwajeetR_11,"Noida, India",50
champawat,A short flight from Delhi and a two and a half hour drive up the mountains of Uttaranchal brought us to this Oasis in the Hills. “Te Aroha” means mountain of love in the Maori language. The owners of the hotel have taken that to mean “abode of love”. This love is clearly seen in the attention to detail in the construction and furnishings of the hotel by the owners.  On arrival we were served a lovely and refreshing welcome drink and were taken up to our room the staff who were very polite and well-trained. Our room was called the “Master’s bedroom” and was exquisite! It had a separate living area with a large glass window wall leading to a balcony from which one could see the Himalaya range on a clear day.
