champawat,"We had a close knit destination wedding at Hotel Harshikhar in October 2019. After visiting many hotels and resorts in Haldwani and Ramnagar area, we visited this hotel and gave our heart at the first glance itself to the lovely view and well maintained property.  Every staff right from Kavita, Sushil, Sanjeev Ji, Chef Balwant and last but not the least the GM Mr Rishi was on their toes right from the moment we arrived. They went out of their way to provide superior service and made our wedding an experience to remember for life. We really appreciate the hospitality and courtesy offered by all of them.  Apologies for late review but this lockdown has given me time to sit back and relive the memories of my wedding and that cannot be done without thanking the people who made it",Akanksha Singh,/Profile/Pranu1808,,50
champawat,"Just visited this property recently. This place is the best in the entire region. Amazingly lovely view from the terrace. The restaurant at roof top balcony has a Breathtaking view of the bheemtal Lake. The majestic looks of the lake and the mountains from the rooms gives you a feeling of spending time at the very best locales in the country. The Management right from the General Manager Mr Rishi to Sushil to pankaj et all besides the helping staff is as courteous and submissive as one can be. Kudos to the owners who have appointed such choicest devoted people who ensure  to make you feel like a king.

Hotel only gives importance to the people who book this property in bulk. Dinner timings were from evening 8, but not even a single day during our stay we were served dinner on time. We asked for an extra quilt which was not given even after waiting for Half an Hr and the excuse was that they are busy because of the party which was going on. House keeping number just use to keep ringing and no one use to answer and ultimately one has to ring reception to get the issue resolved. We even complaint about it, but the result was still zero.

We chose Hotel Harshikhar and following are the reasons why It turned out to be a perfect decision. 1. They accommodated us, a family of 6 at a moments notice.

The hotel is right by the lake but the architecture is terrible. Parking is a cumbersome process and arriving at the check in desk requires an effort.

In the evenings we would just sit and watch this MASSIVE MOON rise from behind the hills and stretch its reflection over the lake. With the cool mountain breeze wafting across your face, it's a moment that can turn you poetic. The only sore point is the window AC protruding into the balcony cramping the already small space.
