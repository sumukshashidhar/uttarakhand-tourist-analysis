Due to the incessant rain and hail storm we were not able to see the famous peaks but the glorious sunsets, the fresh mountain breeze and the peace and quiet made up for it. The entire staff is very courteous and helpful. Naman and Ishita were very friendly and hospitable and made sure we were comfortable. We left the property with a parting gift of rosemary fresh from the farm and organic honey inscribed with their initials, for warm remembrance.

champawat,This is a bit late post but I cannot refrain myself to review this property. Still almost after 3 months my memories gets refreshed. Absolutely stunning property with Fabulous Mountain Range View. We opted for Duplex for 2 days as we were 4 friends reunion after so many years. From the reception till the departure our every request is acknowledged with absolute Humbleness by every staff of this hotel. Not only the location but travellers comfort is equally important and I think everyone is doing a tremendous job. The only thing that I feel is that the Food was bit dearer in price. Else everything was Great.Keep it up Team Casa Dreams. Will definately recommend this to everyone in my network.Cheers,Amazing_14,/Profile/Amazing_14,"Sydney, Australia",50

To start with, the resort has an excellent location. As a traveler one has to avoid wasting time in locating a hotel/resort or in peering through the Google Maps on reaching a particular town. Moreover, after a tiresome journey, the one thing that a person desperately wants to find is a cozy room, without any hassles. Casa ticks all the boxes in this regard.

We also got a lovely room facing the whole valley (almost 180-degree view). A couple of issues - probably not related to the resort - it's expensive to get a ride to proper Mukteshwar.

I liked most things about the place: the rooms are good, the staff is hospitable, the facilities are decent, the food is edible and the location is good. Despite all this I will never visit this place courtesy a DJ that they have on sight. I mean, most city dwellers travel to the mountains for some peace and serenity. But, I returned from my holiday with a headache, all thanks to the DJ playing the cheesiest Bollywood numbers starting from 7pm until 11pm at night on full blast. Worse still, the dance floor is in the open right next to the residential building and the only lawn they have. So neither can you sit in the lawns and talk nor can you sleep in your room. Despite our repeated requests the hotel management wouldn't",nikhiln9,/Profile/nikhiln9,"Noida, India",30

My family and I enjoyed the food very much and the ethnic food was great!  Weather: We came during the summer so the weather was great! Way better then any other part of India during this time of year. There were many outdoor activities near the resort that they kindly guided us to. Things like fruit picking, hiking, and bird watching really makes you appreciate the beautiful nature without the man made life.

champawat,"They are incomplete to give hospitality, they should not start the hotel until its finished. Online sites gives room with bfast and dinner, They even dont know what does it mean, they didnt serve buffet, they said u order from menu, one u done with your food, they will ask you to pay the bill. Rooms didnt have chairs to sit, shower ib bathrooms wasn't working, very poor power-backup. Once you sleep at 12 at night they put off the Mcb of your room. poor hot water supply. I stayed two nights, both nights we were shunting for the amenities, its was like we been to hotel for paid trials, not to rejuvenate, and relax.  but the owner is very cooperative, responding, helpful, he was ready to help u and rectify on each step.. Again I would say first they finish the hotel then start,",saimahmad,/Profile/saimahmad,"Noida, India",20

champawat,"There is no other property even close to the warmth and the beauty that one can experience at Casa Dream Resort, Mukteshwar. A fairly new location and new resort gives best of both worlds- Untouched location with Modern facilities. The view is fabulous- a complete 180 degree view of the valley from the top and each room had balconies. The ride was easy and we had no problem reaching the resort in our cars. We visited in the best season i.e. the summers and had lots of fun with our family and friends. Our group had people of all ages and everybody enjoyed to the maximum! The young ones took up the challenge of trekking behind the resort ...where each turn showed us new views- sometime waterfall...sometimes a small temple on top of a hill...to small huts and farms scattered",suruchibamba,/Profile/suruchibamba,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50

We stayed here along with our friends and family. The Manager took great care of all our demands (we had 2 young kids with us). He personally ensured that our demands of spl. arrangement of kid's food is taken care of. We stayed for 2 nights & on both the night spl. arrangement of bonfire was done with some scrumptious snacks, chef special beetroot kebabs and kaju methi rolls were just awesome.  i took a chance by booking it since it did not had any reviews but boy luck was with me on this one and it turned out to be a jackpot, I couldn't have asked for better",Dhirendra Singh,/Profile/maildhirendra,"Noida, India",50
