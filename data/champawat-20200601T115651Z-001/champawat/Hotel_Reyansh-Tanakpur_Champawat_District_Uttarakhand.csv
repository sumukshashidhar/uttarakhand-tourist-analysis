champawat,"I have been around the Indo/Nepali border for a few years and was pretty happy when the Reyansh was opened. A couple if brothers run the place - one speaks much better English then the other. The place is clean and well located. Room service is only non veg but the town has great alternatives. If you're booking online the only difference between rooms is only one floor level and a bar fridge. I recall it's too big a difference in the room price. If you're in a romantic mood there is optional blue led lighting. Most importantly, if you want a hot shower make sure that you know to switch the hot wet e heater is on - the heater has a light and the switch is on the outside of the bathroom. Also, if you want an English movie or music program the English speaking host will set it up",geoff,/Profile/retireland,"Munich, Germany",50
champawat,Clean room and a really comfortable bed and got a long hot shower. Parked my motorcycle while headed for Nepal to review my Indian visa and stored my bags for no additional costs. All staff were very helpful. Highly recommended.,Gert S,/Profile/253gerts,"Bhimtal, India",50
champawat,"We stayed at this property during my recent trip to Tanakpur. Hotel Reyansh was a wonderful surprise for us. With  large clean rooms, propmt service and lip-smacking food, this is a complete Value for Money.   Cons * Large clean rooms with modern amenities * Helpful and courteous staff * Nearness to the city market & Bus Stand * Safe Parking  Thanks to Ankit for all his help & support in making this trip memorable. Really appreciate his personal supervision - ensuring a comfortable stay for us.   NB : I would suggest connecting with Ankit before travelling as he can help you plan your trip itinerary.",Indraneel,/Profile/indraneelm2018,"New Delhi, India",50
