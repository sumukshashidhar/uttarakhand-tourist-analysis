champawat,"I was excited when this hotel appeared in Tanakpur so I booked a room online. When I got to the room I found that the window in the room opened to a closed concrete box. It was not what I expected when the price I paid should have got a better room. I went to reception and paid an extra 1,000 rps to get a better room. The hotel should have treated me better.",geoff,/Profile/retireland,"Munich, Germany",30
champawat,"The hotel is located at the end of a street. Parking is a problem as it does not have captive parking space. The staff is very good, soft spoken and eager to help. Being a new hotel they are still in the setting up stage and there is a need for improvement in many areas. Overall the rooms were clean, the linen was relatively clean and it does need improvement. Bathroom fittings and quality is top class and were clean. It is by far the best place to stay if ever one is in Tanakpur. Would recommend it and would not mind coming back and staying there.
