Calm and serene, the majestic view of Nandadevi, Panchachili, Maiktoli and Panwalidwar is a feast for the eyes. The Resort itself is located in the midst of the jungle, about 10 minutes ride from the main town, where taking a morning or an evening stroll to the neighbouring village is a pure delight.   The service was excellent, with welcoming staff whom you could talk to about the place and the locality and they’ll fill you in with details.

champawat,"It was a heavenly exprience of my life which i felt during my stay with Parwati Resort where we had stayed from 29/05/2011 to 2/06/2011 with my family and friends. We were total seven (7) families who stayed here. We occupied all the seven individual Himalaya facing cottages. It is an excellent resort for couples, family, outdoor adventures and large group.   We all had a great time together during our 4 days stay at this resort. The food was excellent and the resort has provided all the foods as per our request (especially Veg. Jain food etc.).    The resort is well maintained and the moment you check in, you will feel like you are in 'PARADISE'. The whole place has so much to offer, the view of the Himalaya, the beautiful flora and fauna and the well manicured lawns etc.  ",stockme74,/Profile/stockme74,Mumbai,40
champawat,"After reading about the mysterious and intriguing Patel Bhuvaneshwar caves in a blog, we decided to make it our first stop in our Kumaon Sojourn. Searched in Internet and found that accommodation in this village was very limited. We were very happy to find out about the Patal Resort (formerly known as the Parwarti Resort). When we contacted the resort, we were even more surprised by the expedient reply we got from Suruchi, whose father owns the Parwati Group of Hotels in the Kumaon.  Suruchi was very helpful in assisting us plan the trip (1st time to Kumaon and we are from Malaysia). She even helped us to get a driver for our week's vacation in the hills. And what a wonderful driver he turned out to be.   The Patal Resort is located in a high spot and very near to the village",shanti288,/Profile/shanti288,"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",30

champawat,"What can i say to a place we had driven by 4 years earlier & came back to stay for 2 days? On an earlier trip to Uttranchal, we had visited the fabulous ancient cave temples of Patal Bhuvaneshwar & had sighted this hotel, still being finished. What attracted us was the fabulous location of this place, facing the majestic Himalayan mountains which looked beautiful at sunset.  So this time, we planned a detour while driving down from Munsiyari & on our way to Kausani. The hotel is pretty basic. The main structure has the dining hall & rooms on 2 levels, but some of the rooms face away from the mountains. The rooms are not very large & so we decide to check out the cottages. These are situated on a level lower then the main building but EVERY cottage has fabulous view of the",bombaytraveller,/Profile/bombaytraveller,"Mumbai, India",30

champawat,"A hotel with separate cabins and lovely views of the surrounding hills. There was no heat or hot water (=no shower), and no toilet paper. The towels were not just stained but dirty. I slept in my clothes and travel sheet. The food was just OK. But walking in the area was stimulating and in the hills just across from the hotel was a tiny Shiva shrine which was cared for by a local priest. The hotel is several miles from the nearest town.",Paul K,/Profile/go2places,California,20
