kangra,"Nice location, cozy rooms friendly staff. easy approach on road to Dharamshala. Parking is of little concern as there is no proper parking area, even though staff take care of the vehicles parked around.",Dr Harjitpal Singh,/Profile/harjitpalsingh,"Chandigarh, India",40
kangra,"I was accommodated there for a friend's wedding since the venue was stone's throw distance away. This place turned out to be so much more then a hotel - the hosts ; Mr and Mrs Chimbalhari were warm as family, the staff was eager to help out and they took care of the slightest detail. Not to mention,  the rooms and the balcony have beautiful views of the mountains. The stay was indeed the highlight of my trip. Wish to be back soon with my family. Highly recommended for travellers looking for a home away from him.",dhruv1389,/Profile/dhruv1389,"Noida, India",50
kangra,"Nice rooms, exellent homely food with lesser Spices, very good service, terrific location. 3 km away from Palampur, so, you can feel peace here. Great. Will surely visit again and will suggest my friends","Kinner Aacharya, Rajkot, Gujarat",/Profile/Kinner123,,40
kangra,The location is peaceful and away from the tourist bustles while just close enough to the major tourist spots you would want to visit. The rooms with a view make for perfect mornings and luxurious nights. The staff is very courteous and extremely accommodating. The chef is simply brilliant!,Devavrat Mathur,/Profile/DevavratM2,"Noida, India",50
kangra,"Chimbalhar Heights is a really very good hotel. I got all the amenities which i could not find anywhere in hilly areas like Himachal. The hotel is located at an exquisite place which is Palampur. The' view' from the hotel is pretty awesome. All the religious as well as trekking places are just near to this hotel (like Baijnath temple, Chamunda Temple, Jwala Devi Temple etc.). A person can go to Dharamshala/ Mcleodganj & Bir Billing within half an hour from this hotel. As it is located in the Capital city of India (Palampur) in terms of Tea, a person can find various areas to roam here & there at a very small distance (like Neugal Khad River to feel peace). The food was amazing. I did not feel that i am eating in a hotel or anywhere outside my home, it was like home made food.",Sumit S,/Profile/SumitS2457,,50
kangra,"Heavenly place! All the staff members including owners are highly motivated and ensure you live every moment while on vacation at their hotel. Excellent food is also a major plus, hotel cook also do prepare chicken dishes at advance notice. Excellent location (around 1-2 KM's far from city) and this is all needed for a peaceful vacation.  I am still here for next couple of days but couldn't resist posting this review even before checkout. Apart from local attractions in Palampur, one can cover easily the Bir(Paragliding paradise) and Barot from this hotel's location. I have posted couple of pictures for the mountains view from hotel balconies. Must considering place, if you are visiting Palampur. It's not a resort kind of a hotel and has got around 10 rooms but cleanliness and",Dimpy87,/Profile/Dimpy87,"Noida, India",50
kangra,"Stayed here for 1 night with family as my flight got cancelled. A newly built small hotel with 10 rooms at a beautiful location in Chimbalhar village on palampur road. Surrounded by Dhauladar range on one side and local farms and pine forest on the other side. Clean rooms. Excellent room service. Rooms have small balconies. They serve a-la-carte vegetarian meals on order and the best part is meals are freshly prepared on order and you get a homely kitchen food like 'tawe' ki roti,parantha. Room and meals rates are very pocket friendly. Opt for super deluxe room if going with family. Excellent place for bachelor parties. The only thing I found missing in summer was that there are no airconditioners....only fans. Everything else is awesome. Want a good budget place in a peaceful",VinayDrBhardwaj,/Profile/VinayDrBhardwaj,,50
