kangra,To be very clear it's not a Hilton or Radisson by far but it's the best of lot in tiny mountain village.  The rooms and clean and big with splendid views from the balcony. You will be overlooking the entire valley and the snow clad mountains beyond. It's awe inspiring to gaze out into open with towering mountains being dwarfed by the sheer expanse of the night sky. All this from the comfort of your hotel room.  The amenities provided are basic. The quality of the food is good and the breakfast spread is decent. It's located well close to the Gandhi chowk which is one of the 2 main shopping areas.  The staff are courteous and help out with your travel plans as best they can. There a lot of places where you can get some amazing pictures of the surrounding landscapes. All in all we,AmolMathur,/Profile/AmolMathur,"Mumbai, India",40

This goes out to the staff who were very helpful and courteous at all times - especially Mr. Rajneesh who would personally make sure that you are attended to well. For the food - the breakfast had a good spread though nothing too great, but the dinner was sumptuous.

The centrally heated rooms and lots of hot water in the shower made the stay really comfortable. Bed was big and comfortable as well and while the toiletries are nothing to write home about, they were provided.  What could be better:  1. Room service. We were connecting with family after a long time and had a lot of catching up to do. Unavailability of any decent food option late in the night was definitely a spoiler  2. Breakfast had variety but was really average. In contrast, we appreciated the breakfast at a hotel with one third the price earlier in the trip where we were literally offered little choice but whatever was on the menu tasted great!",Ishvinder Singh,/Profile/vinichandhok,"Manila, Philippines",40

Firstly, if you’re after this hotel or had decided to book this one following the name of CLARKS franchise and some fancy photographs on different booking portals - then it is absolutely over stated. The hotel looks a premium property but that’s no where close to reality.  Secondly; coming to our first interaction with hotel staff ie., checking formalities. In this era where customer service from every company is supreme or tying to deliver atleast a flawless customer experience, the guy was quite rude and was not at all Co-operative.

Large room which had a balcony with fabulous views. Free wifi for more than one device per person. It's seems common in India to sometimes charge for wifi and for connection of one device per person- absolutely ridiculous. Between 5.30pm to 9.30pm daily there was a DJ playing loud music on the terrace- disco with bar. Hotel Management- please reconsider this as the music is too loud and unbearable for guests to enjoy the views over a drink.

kangra,This property is located at a hill view and has well designed rooms and amenities. The problem is not the hotel really but the management and the staff.   The F&B manager would not ever smile and serve you with happiness or hospitality. Instead the most disappintong gesture was that we were evertime made aware of what's chargeable and what not. We pay high value per night and something like a slice of bread butter requested for a kid costs rs 60 and that's terrible according to me.  We wouldn't even mind paying if that's in the rulebook but a guest is capable of spending thousands of rupees per night and it's offensive when you are informed about such rules.    In all the hotel policy is unfriendly and I wouldn't recommend the stay here. ,ShindeForam,/Profile/ShindeForam,,20

It was holi and the hotel was decked up in a cute colourful way. The reception was nice and the lounge area was a big space overlooking the valley which is gorgeous. You will feel like staying there forever. But as I mentioned the service is slow and somehow not up to the mark. The staff needs more experience to run the show properly.
