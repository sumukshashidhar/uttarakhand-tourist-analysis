kangra,"This review has been long due. But here I am.  The resort in set with gorgeous backdrop of the Dhauladhar. They have a beautiful terrace which gives you a 360 degree view: both of the mountains and the green valley.  It is newly constructed so infrastructure is all prim and proper.  The staff is very prompt and sweet. They treat you like family. The owner Suchit attends to important events himself.  Things you would need for a destination are the following, and they took care of all of them:  - transfers for your guests (the airport is pretty close) - welcome at the reception - welcome kits in the rooms - bridal suites - a hall that accommodates people - roof for other events  - dedicated mandap area - a Himachali folk performance   They can also help you with local vendors in",Wamika S,/Profile/wamika_singh,,50

I was allotted an under maintenance room which was stinking badly, linens were not changed, cockroaches and other insects were there in crockery and electric kettle, electricity board in bedroom and tap in bathroom were coming out etc. The staff was so uncooperative that when I complained more than 4 times and requested for room change, it was changed. The restaurant was charging higher than the rates mentioned on the menu card and corrected the bills when pointed out. The pillow covers and linens were not changed and we're dirty. Overall the worst service I have ever seen. Would never recommend even if the resort charges zero amount as it",Someshwar B,/Profile/bansalsomeshwar,"Jaipur, India",10

kangra,We were part of marriage guest in the hotel in month of July and it rains a lot in that month.The hotel is almost 15 km away from Mclordganj and one needs to rely on taxi or local bus service to move around. Dharamshala is very pretty and specially so in rainy season as everything is green so the surroundings of hotel were nice.The only negative was that the sewerage pipe of hotel was out open into the road which should be addressed and I worry about garbage disposal which as far as I know about Dharamshala is nonexistent so am sure is polluting some corner of the beautiful valley.I wish these matters are addressed before hotel is built.

Even the bathroom did not have a shower seperation and just a curtain was hanging although we paid upwards of Rs. 6000/- for a single night. Our earlier experience at dharamshala was at Fortune Park and after that this proved to be a huge let down.,Rgpks19,/Profile/Rgpks19,,10
kangra,"Visited this new property in March . It is fairly on the outskirts of Dharamshala, the view is beautiful. The rooms are big and comfortable. The staff is humble and took good care.If you have your own means of transport to go about Dharamshala then go for it. Have a pleasant stay!",anameka_1,/Profile/anameka_1,"New Delhi, India",40
kangra,"I had an exceptional visit at the D’polo. The staff was great and very attentive. They helped me with everything from arranging transportation to information on places to visit. The food was great. Although I did not actually visit the kitchen the entire hotel was certainly clean and up to the standards of western clients. If you’re looking for a very nice hotel, clean rooms,  good food, and friendly staff I would gladly recommend this property. ",Shawny M,/Profile/shawnym2017,"Cabo San Lucas, Mexico",50
