kangra,"Hi, I stayed in this hotel in March 2020. This is a decent 4-star hotel. Had a very easy check in.  The room was clean and has heater running (happy to get away from cold) when we checked into the room. The room had a balcony with warning to keep door closed at all times. There were many facilities available in room like - free wifi, iron box, hair dryer, intercoms, television, etc. Breakfast had good choices of Indian and English breakfast with live omelette counter. We also enjoyed the dinner at The Orchard restaurant. Mr. Sathish the waiter had given good suggestions of food to enjoy there. Overall good and tasty Indian food.  In the hotel, they had many facilities like Gymnasium, yoga center, bar, spa, kids play zone (named as champions zone), travel desk, etc.  I would say",BKP-4P,/Profile/BKP-4P,chennai,50

In the few sunny intervals we enjoyed the views over the hills. 3,5 km from the hotel a higher situated viewing point offers you even better opportunities for Himalaya pictures.  Our room 206 could only be reached by an open air gangway where the rain was trying to make rivers and temperatures were very low, open to the wind as it was.

Although it did mention that it was 5 kms from the town's main square, we realized only once we reached the hotel, what 5 kms means in the hills. The twisting  roads seem endless and we were told by our driving companion, that during season, the drive can be exasperating.  Another interesting thing we discovered was that the hotel keeps rooms in different sections reserved for bookings through various hotel aggregators but the best ones are reserved for direct bookings!

Take the White Mountain Block or the Christmas Block & a club room for uninterrupted views, the lower rooms may have trees blocking your view, so ask the booking agent/hotel of the location of rooms beforehand.

We also tried some menu options for dinner and it turned out to be excellent.   The hotel is bit of cutoff from the market for about 3 to 4 kms. If you are looking for a peaceful holiday then this works otherwise you would need a cab whole day to come and go from the market.   It is bit confusing also sometimes to reach to the respective floors if you room is at -5.

Unfortunately the rooms even in the category we were staying in i.e. the ones with balcony did not have view of the mountains 2. The temperature outside was zero in the evening and would drop to minus on the night. A brand like ITC should arrange for a common sleeping room for the drivers. But that is not the case. The driver has to sleep in the car. Thankfully on my special request the hotel provided two blankets to the driver.  Pros  1.

I had booked online through Booking.com and booked the only room option available, which did not justify the room rent charged and must say the rooms could have been better in terms of the views and cleanliness. More so when the charges in the off season were noticeably high, the upkeep should and could have been better.   Another suggestion is to have a shuttle between the hotel and Mclodeganj or else charge the cabs as per the approved rates by government. The cab service at the hotel charges much more than the approved amount charged by the taxi unions.   Overall a good location with good food.  ",Aruj Seth,/Profile/arujseth,"New Delhi, India",30

There is no thermostat in the room to control the temperature. You have the sleep at the temperature that the hotel thinks is best for you.  In feb, temperature outside is 12 C but due to no ventilation, the room temperature is more than 30 and the AC in the room can be only be used for heating. They have a system that pulls air from outside and cools the room, but hardly any success with that system. The system though isn't working, sounds like an early 2000 generator.   2.

Location: Far from town on a super dodgy road (r600 return) With precious little charm it kind of reminded me of a 70's Holiday Inn/resort, but in 2016 ;)  The restaurant was good enough, spa was very good (managed by an outside Co), views were good (mostly covered in dense fog in July - through no fault of the hotel of course. Probably stunning in season). Room was tired, but just about clean enough, although we did request a linen change on arrival.

She assured us that the innova would be there to pick us up. She said it would cost us 2200 if we pay through the hotel and 1800 if we pay her cash directly.

kangra,Perhaps the best hotel in mcleodgunj . High in the stovari hills is a quite and beautiful place call moksha . Just like the name it gives you an out of the world experience. It has three blocks . All the rooms have view and a balcony. The rooms are spik and span. Break buffet is really nice. Bed is soft and king size . Lovely view and just about 10 mins from the main square. I think there are better food option in mcleodgunj as they offer the local and Italian cuisine. I will visit this hotel every time I go to mcleodgunj. Thanks moksha for the hospitality.,Ajay J,/Profile/870ajayj,,50

We complained to chef to have it remade. 3. To just make things worse, hot water is cold in the morning. My kids ended up taking shower in cold water and despite 30 mins of complaint it is not rectified.  I will pay 32,000  for two nights here and basic thing like hot water is not provided!!

If your purpose is to enjoy weather, beautiful mountain range and have a slow and relaxing time then this is a good resort. I feel its better suited for business/team building trips. We chose this resort purely on trip advisor ratings and since it was one of the very few luxury hotels in McLeodGanj.  The food is good and the property is well maintained in general. The room we stayed was okay but it had water dripping from bathroom roof (something that i've never experienced in a resort around this price range).

The hotel is quite good, nice caring staff with good facilities and amenities, good food, lovely ambience etc. Everything about it was good except the Wi Fi policy...advertised as free Wi Fi on their web site prominently, but actually they are very snooty about it. Free wify comes with several riders which they tell the guest on arrival only...which actually spoils the good mood. It doesnt cost the sky as everyone has unlimited access at homes and expects that... but I wonder if it costs the hotel much more???? Our kids carry several games on their gizmos for which wifi is required and they were disappointed, but it appears it is some policy issue with ITC group, which they",HPSMiglani,/Profile/HPSMiglani,Amritsar,40

The grounds are absolutely beautiful, and the garden areas are well kept: the grass is cut and clean, and there are several magnificent statues. The views of the surrounding terraces, and of the valleys and amazing mountains are spectacular - almost unbelievable. The birds of prey flying overhead really add to the great opportunities for photography.  The food on offer is good, and we ended up eating here every evening. There is a buffet for breakfast with cereals, bakery items, fruit, toast, juices, and cooked items served with tea and/or coffee.

Fortune's recent entry into this region is a welcome change to that.  The hotel is located a little outside of the center of town, and takes about 20 minute drive from McLeod Ganj, but well worth it.  Rooms are clean and spacious, service and food was also very good.  At breakfast sit next to the windows and you can see the snow capped mountains with your coffee.  Wish I had another day to stay, but will return.

Next is dining area ambience and layout is perfect but there are hordes of waiter's nobody knows what to do and once you order something they get confused and you are served with cold poorly prepared dish.this is best property in mcleodganj but they have to look into improving confused uninterested staff.,Deepikakhosla,/Profile/Deepikakhosla,"Ludhiana, India",40
