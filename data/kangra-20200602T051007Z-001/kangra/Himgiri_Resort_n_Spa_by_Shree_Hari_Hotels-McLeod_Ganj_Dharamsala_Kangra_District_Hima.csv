kangra,"As I write this review I’m currently at Himgiri resorts. The weather has been quite a spoilt sport for last 48 hours and while we hope we get better weather tomorrow, today was largely spent at the hotel. The hotel is fairly away from main square Macleodganj. This is actually at Naddi. There are steep roads that lead to the hotel, it’s best to have a personal car. There is parking space for a few cars within the hotel. They have quite a few cottages, with breathtaking views of the Dhauladhar range. Food is quite delicious, though limited options (since their main chef doesn’t stay here during off seasons is what we’ve been told). Other cages around the main square are great for lunch. We’ve had our dinners and breakfasts at the hotel itself. Strangely, the resort calls itself a",Mads0209,/Profile/Mads0209,"Kolkata, India",40

The view (see pics) is awesome and the cost is worth it if you think its more than the neighborhood. The hospitality is gr8 in such a place.
