I stayed for two nights - it was off-season, and I had the place to myself (almost). It is expensive but worth the money. The staff work under difficult conditions in the winter or in bad weather, and still do a great job to make your stay comfortable. Away from Palampur town, it is a good place to walk, work, rest and rejuvenate.",Bringi Dev,/Profile/bringid,"Bengaluru, India",50

I certainly cannot dispute the beauty of the location, the cleanliness of my room nor the way an 80year old was allocated room as near as possible to the restaurant- but in spite of that, I found this hotel a struggle. OK I could request an electric buggy to transport me around , but that restricted impulsive freedom. For a normal, active person, I can see it would be wonderful.

I have always preferred to stay at places that could be a tad expensive as compared to other options in the market but are a class apart when it comes to their hospitality and service. And Rakkh was no different.  So after reading a lot of positive reviews and watching few youtube videos about Rakkh me and my husband  finally decided to book our 5 day stay here in April. Though the check in time was 1pm, we reached at 9am coz we took the overnight bus from Delhi (you can also take a direct flight from delhi to gaggal airport which is just 90 mins away from the resort) and we were not just allowed to checkin to our mountain cottage but were also offered",Fiza D,/Profile/DayTrip579150,,40

The originality of the experience is palpable in the food, service, and activities - a charming display of Pahadi culture that is hard to come by.

Avoid the 2 rooms underneath the restaurant as you can hear the music and the noise kind of break the beautiful peaceful atmosphere . Rooms are confortable and contain everything you need .

The food arrangement is so ridiculous here. Tonight they had arranged a local cuisine for the guests in the buffet. If you look at the facility of preparation, you would run-off from this place. 🤒🤒🤒 And when asked to serve in the room, the food was served at the temperature at which sweet dishes like RABRI or FIRNI are served.

They have good trekking routes nearby and the activity coordinators (special mention goes to Moca and Suman) keep you well informed and eager to engage you in various activities be it trekking, mountain drives, para gliding etc. Also bonfires in the night are a welcome change where one can relax, play music and have some hot drink.
