One needs to walk down the small hill and then cross a metal bridge over the Revulet to reach the hotel. Hotel location, food and service is superb. One can trek in the jungle behind the hotel.  Hotel rooms are constructed in old India achectect style. There is no TV in the rooms for me this is best thing as one can have more discussion with family.

kangra,"We visited this property for a short 4 nights stay in a big group, and we couldn't have chosen a better place to stay. The property is absolutely stunning with a fabulous view of the Dhauladhar range and the Manooni river flowing right through it. The woods behind the property are breathtakingly beautiful, with a variety of flowers and birds. There is a fun trail to a sunset point that takes about 40 mins, totally worth it. The property itself is very well designed, earthy and open. Rooms are spacious and very clean. They have activities like table tennis and a games room, and a small library. The staff is extremely helpful and efficient, and the food is divine. They organised several activities for us too, like bonfires every night, Karaoke sessions and Sufi night.

And very very reasonably priced.  We had a Family Suite on the ground floor. The accommodation left a lot to be desired. Opening and shutting the wood framed windows was a challenge. They had to be slammed shut or pried open. Another challenge because the room had a musty smell and we needed to keep the windows open to let the smell out. The carpets were worn and the floor was mountain stone (didn't feel very clean). Specially a problem in the toilet. It's a mountain lodge. One needs to set one's expectations accordingly.

So the property is huge, lush green with breathtaking views and you need to trek down a little to reach the property..it was so fun and adventurous coz the surroundings was something to die for.. and be ready to meet the host you would't see anywhere in your life.. It seems that hospitality runs in their blood.. This husband wife duo will make sure that you have a slpendous time, Mr Kishore is an adventurous chap and keeps on sharing his thrilling experiences and Amita ji is such a simple patient and a humble lady and is more than willing to help you out..

The major highlights of the place were its location, food and world class hospitality.   Very rare you find that the property owner is interacting with you and getting you introduced to other guests of the hotel. You get absolute freedom in terms of consuming your drinks and own cooked food in any part of the property.   It was indeed a class apart and an unforgettable experience.

Most of my early mornings were spent next to this clean sparkling water. Just next to the property was forest for trekking. The Resort owners had thoughtfully marked a track on the rocks. Food was up to everyone's liking. All interiors were done by someone with an impeccable taste, so each and everything was thoughtfully placed.

The clean environment made us feel safe walking our pet without the leash. She too owned the place for 2 nights. The natural elements like the canals (known as cool), swings and recreational area make it ideal for youngsters 8 - 14 years. The surprise sufi night added to the pleasure. I would recommend at least one visit if you are fond of adventure. Two nights are just enough. I am not too sure if the resort is congenial for people 65 and above.

kangra,I stayed at Prakriti Aalay on 4th and 5th June. The Location of the resort is excellent for the people living in metropolitan cities  and want to spent some time with nature's quaintness. This place is very relaxing and brings you near nature. It's a must recommend place for nature lovers and people who want to spend some time at river Bank. The sound of water is like a music to your ears if you are tired of traffic noise and pollution.  Rooms are also very good and nicely presented. Resort staff is also very helpful and prompt in their services.  The resort food is not so good. I didn't enjoyed the food at the resort. Resort should improve their food quality.

In the morning or evening you can sit near the river or enjoy the open tarace and have food. It also has facility of badminton, table tennis etc.  In the evening they arranged folk dance and music on one day and live guitar on next day.  They also prepared food as per our choice.

The location is just perfect with musical stream at one side and tall perfect pine woods on the other . The trek to backside mountain is the best to see an amazing sunset and beautiful snow peaks of dauladhar range of the Himalayas. Our suite named peak Matterhorn has the picture perfect view from the window and the extra bed on the upper deck of the room is just amazing to spend some ‘me’ time .

Breakfast is eggs to order accompanied by Chole Bhature or Paranthas. Meals are simple and accordingly priced. The place is located very close to the road head but a trek of about 300 meters from the private parking of Prakriti Aalay to the resort can be slightly tricky for oldies. Notwithstanding the same, the resort staff is prompt to reach you at the parking to carry the luggage till the resort.

For the adventurous souls, there are mountain bike rides available and trekking too, there's a badminton court, swings outdoor as well as in the cottage balconies.. Best was the bonfire that is arranged every evening wherein all the guests sit around it and enjoy the nature.

kangra,"We recently spent 4 nights at Prakriti Aalay as a family. We booked a room based on the numerous positive reviews and the hotel's website that claims the place is in tune with nature. The settings are nice indeed and there are some pleasant little walks to do around, but there is nothing ""eco"" in this so-called eco-lodge. The owner is definitely better skilled at advertising then at implementing a real environment-friendly practises in his hotel. He even showed a surprisingly high tolerance for loud music - which was precisely what we wanted to escape from (we live in Delhi and have our fair share of noise all year long).   In short, I would not recommend anyone in search for nature and quietness to stay at Prakriti Aalay.",Vincent,/Profile/whateever,,20

The rooms are spacious, the staff is courteous, the owners themselves welcome the guests, a river flows right next to the property.  They serve local delicacies along with the common favourites, and everything is really very delicious.  You can enjoy a trek at the nearby hill or grab a mountain bike and go for nice ride.
