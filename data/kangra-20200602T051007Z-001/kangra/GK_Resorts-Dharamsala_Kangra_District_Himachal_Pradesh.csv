kangra,ほぼ知識なしでダラムシャーラー訪問時にインド人の知人の紹介で利用。 知人を介して価格交渉するも、当初はインターネットの相場よりかなり高め。 最終的には一般的な値段になり利用するも、ドライバーは昼食の要求、チップの要求、時短を進める行程の提案など、悪い部分が目につき不満が残った。 会社は問題なくても、ドライバー個人の行動で印象が変わるためぜひ教育をしてほしい。,AKSN,/Profile/aksn1225,"Shizuoka, Japan",20
kangra,Only hotel I would recommend if you wish to visit Gyuto Monastery and Norbulingka Institute as they are near the hotel. We took a family suite which was on 2nd floor and the rooms were new and clean. Dinner and breakfast we had was good. Staff was courteous and helpful. When you reach the facility you will not see GK Resorts written but they have there own restaurant and its name you will see instead. Just follow the google maps and you will reach at correct location.,Ramneek S,/Profile/ramneek40,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
kangra,This resort is currently under construction and only one section has been opened for guests. The in house restaurant offers only vegetarian fare but has good options. The rooms were good however the property is located quite outside the dharamshala town.,Rgpks19,/Profile/Rgpks19,,40
