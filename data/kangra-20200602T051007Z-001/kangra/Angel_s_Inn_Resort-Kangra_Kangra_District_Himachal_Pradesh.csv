kangra,"We checked into this hotel on 30-3-2019 and checked out on 1-4-2019. Hotel is pretty good, rooms are clean. However what impressed me a lot is the staff, they were very courteous, as we reached very late in the night we called them requesting for dinner to be provided and they obliged without any fuss. Dinner was provided at 11:30 PM as per our menu order. The same courtesy was there throughout our stay. Food was very tasty. I appreciate the friendly restaurant staff and helpful reception staff. I strongly recommend this Hotel for all those visiting Dharamsala",Maligere Gowda,/Profile/Maligere,"Hassan District, India",50
kangra,"Not good for silent traveller's ,I suggest staff not humble talks rash languages  Who ever has been the owner doesn't know how to host good gatherings. It has been category as 4star either way it's not even 2 star category.   Do not waste your money and time   We ordered Biryani haydrabadi it looks some one has cooked raw.......",Norstar Group,/Profile/Norstargroup,"Dehradun, India",10

kangra,"We visited Dharmshala and stayed here in a big group and booked 4 rooms with extra beddings. The overall stay was good because the view was beautiful, we had a great company. Pros of hotel- 1. It had a nice building. 2. Beautiful view. 3. Good speed WiFi. 4. average tasting food.   Cons- 1. There were no in-room facilities. Brushing kit not available, dirty and used slippers provided that too only when asked. 2. No maintenance of rooms. The washrooms were looking clean but were stinking of blocked sewage all the time. 3. Bedsheets and quilts were old and had piling balls on them. 4. very very poor service and  attitude.  a) Not even one smiling face in the staff. b) one needs to call up thrice at least and only then house keeping staff would work. c) The staff tries not to do",Prerna A,/Profile/musafir0102,new delhi,20

kangra,This is among the several new hotels/resorts that have sprung up in Dharamshala. The decor is confusing and characterless. This is a standard 3-star hotel. The rooms are spacious and I had one with a small balcony that overlooked onto the road below. The food was average. The breakfast buffet was a mess. The service was slow and laid back. There’s nothing to write home about on this one. ,mraquamarine,/Profile/mraquamarine,"Mumbai, India",30
kangra,The best hotel. Hotel staffs are very cooperative. Food was excellent. We stayed for two days 10th and 11th of September 2017. It was a memorable experience. Rooms are clean and well maintained. They prepared separate food for our child. This shows their hospitality. They have maintained the word Athithi Devo Bhava. It is worth to stay in this hotel.,Jalajakshi R,/Profile/JalajakshiR1,,50
