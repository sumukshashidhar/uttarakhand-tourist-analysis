kangra,"Most pathetic hotel..one should never ever visit this hotel.. the management is not at all good and they are like gang of people who are not at all from hospitality industry. Mr. Bharat who has taken the property on lease don't know how to deal with guests / clinets.  The case is of my friend Mr.Jain from Bhilwara who booked hotel for business event for 15 days.  Now the incident happens like this, paymebts were made in partys as per the bills which were raised time to time. One of the bills were not submitted by hotel staff well on time and was handed over in late evening of friday due to this RTGS was not possible and Mr. Jain offered them.chq payment whcih MD Mr Bharat refused and he instructed security to lock the main gate and don't allow guests and Mr Jain move out.

kangra,The property is great and a nice location. It has great amenities and food. It is also building pool and kids facilities. The staff is friendly. It is a good property to move around if you bring your own car. If you use public transport then you will need to wait or hitchhike. They should consider adding shuttle facilities to Sheela Chowk. ,Kapil R,/Profile/majortravelblogger,,50

The hotel seems to be still under construction. Lift was not working. Its a 2 floor hotel. Rooms with Mountain view are good. Room size is decent for double occupancy. Staff is good.

kangra,"Nice property situated around 5kms before main Dharamshala in Sheela Village. Being a bit away from the main town it is a calm a quiet place ideal for relaxation. Verdant views of the Himalayas and the stream running behind the property give it a very cosy atmosphere. Food though limited in variety is of good quality and tasty. Rooms are quite big and clean. Being a new property, few things are still under construction and once completed the hotel will get a good facelift. The service is slow at times but the staff makes an honest effort to improve the same. I guess they need to be a bit more trained during peak season to handle the rush of guests properly. Other than that nothing much to complain. Enjoyed my 4 day stay here.",Devanjan Chakraborty,/Profile/Devanjan,"New Delhi, India",40
kangra,"Lets me first pass my good wishes to the staff on the reception at Treebo The trance , the team was very courteous and professional . the food in restaurant is awesome . the location is good with mountain view ... now about the property its not in Dharmsala but in Kangra ( 17km away from MCganj ) .The hotel rooms have no cheap finish and lack good quality . the property is under construction and would not recommend until its completely ready . the balconies lack privacy as you could always find someone crawling from the back entrance .",Salil,/Profile/salil1670,"Mumbai, India",10

Food is reasonably priced too with varied menu options. There is rivulet running behind the property. Overall the view is wonderful.  The complementary breakfast had quite a few options. We stayed for a night but will be back for more.  One drawback is while coming to the reception, the ramp and ground level appear same. My husband mis-stepped it twice. We did complain about that. Hope they have set it right by now by placing vases near it or demarcating it somehow...  I deducted one star for that reason only...",Gautami Tripathy,/Profile/gautami2019,,40

kangra,"I happened to stay at this property in Apr'19 for 3 nights and it was a mixed experience. While there were many good moments, I also experienced some instance where in I felt WHY?.  Listing Pros & Cons for future travellers below:  1) The Hotel is located a bit outside the main Dharamshala town, hence their is no issue with reaching the hotel. Approach road and location are very good. Once can watch Dhaulandar Range in full grandeur from the property. There is a quite stream flowing behind the property which is accessible to guests via restaurant.  2) Property as such is new, hence rooms are well laid out, standard rooms are bit too cramped in size, and it would be better to opt for Deluxe rooms for a better experience.

kangra,"Me and my family had already experienced the quality of Treebo hotels and for our trip to Dharamshala, we unanimously decided to book a Treebo hotel in hope to get services worth our money. The hotel is around 6 Km. away from the main Dharamshala city, which is actually a good thing as you can enjoy the peace and calm which we were seeking for from our hectic and chaotic daily lives. The hotel is build aside a small river tributary and along side the tributary is a land of lush green grass and trees. The property position is perfect. We booked two rooms, and one of our rooms had a balcony facing towards the flowing water. We ended up all sitting in the balcony most of the time that we stayed in the hotel.

The rooms are well sized, with LED tv, and they offer a hot water cattle with tea or coffee in the rooms. The attached bathroom is beautiful and with all the facilities. I had a great view to the mountains from my balcony. The food is excellent, Try the Chicken Pasta, it is so delicious that I had it several times during my stay. The staff is very friendly and helpful (I give 5 stars to the staff).

kangra,I visited the hotel in Dec 26th 2018 and it is situated on highway. Full time noise. Hotel staff is not so cooperative as we requested to change room. They say you booked from travigo or treebo pls speak to them. The room does not have grills as well so not safe with kids. The room does not have ac remote. When asked they say call us we will maintain the temprature. The hotel is far from city so not an ideal place for stay.,RDb,/Profile/Bhattraajull,,10

kangra,My trip was planned in first week of December'18. The location of the resort was amazing. It had snow capped mountains in the back and  the location was very peaceful. It had huge space for parking which can be easily used to do bonfire or other stuff you wish too. I really liked the courteous behavior of the entire staff. The rooms were spacious enough and well planned out. The food was also good. Each and every thing was well laid out and clean. The best part of this property which i liked was it was a bit away from Dharamshala city (around 12 kms) which makes it peaceful and spacious. I really enjoyed my stay of 3 days. Also i believe this is the place wherein you can get maximum value for your money.  ,Explore37393802971,/Profile/Explore37393802971,,50
