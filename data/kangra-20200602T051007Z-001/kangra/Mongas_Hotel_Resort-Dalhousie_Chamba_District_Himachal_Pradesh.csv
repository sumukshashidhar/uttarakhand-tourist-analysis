kangra,We stayed there for 2 nights and had room with very small balcony but having clear view of the valley. Staff is nice and polite. Check in and check out was smooth with minimum fuss. Rooms are quite spacious and nicely maintained.  Daily evening they lit bonfire where one can sit and relax. However seating area is very limited. Food was good and very large spread was there which gave you good choices. Highly recommended hotel to stay.,hdg63,/Profile/hdg63,"Mumbai, India",50

Food is one another area where they don't disappoint you event a bit, ample of options during both Buffet Breakfast and Dinner, warmth with which they answer your request while you eat or the bonfire they lit every evening at High Tea time, this is the just the place to be.

The rooms are spacious and clean and heater was provided that kept entire room warm even in freezing temperatures. Only scope of improvement is in the bathroom which needs a little bit of maintenance however it was clean. The food variety is extensive and yummy. Location is perfect.

The architecture of the room is what drew us to the hotel (beautiful high ceiling and balcony) but the owners, Mr & Mrs Singh, are the reason we’ll return again. We had some minor challenges with paperwork but Mr Singh was extremely helpful and turned things around for us and made our second night one of the most memorable in our time in Chamba. We had a bbq on the terrace restaurant our second night and it was amazing! Great atmosphere with the fire and great food.

The access to the hotel is like any other hotel in the hill stations, road leading to these property is quite narrow and prone to traffic jams (same is the case is everywhere in Dalhousie). Also if you visit the market by foot then remember you will have to climb back to the hotel given that its on the built on the slope. The hotel is quite clean and offers a good view of the valley. The staff is decent and the service is good compared to what you get typically in any hill station properties.  The rooms are of different sizes so choose depending on your needs.

Upon entering the room after checkin we somehow got negative vibes from this place. Construction was going on right below our room which was very noisy. We booked a balcony room but the balcony was merely 27 inches wide only I don't know what were they thinking at the time of constructing it. Tap in our bathroom was broken which was fixed after 4 hrs and numerous calls to reception, bathrooms were not clean, there were stains all over, electronic locker was already locked and after requesting many times no one came to open it.

Even the approach road to the hotel was pretty bad.  But, the hotel itself is large with rooms suitable for a family with children. It's one of few hotels which offers 4 beds in a room. Perfect for couples with small kids.  Location: 2 minute walk from the Mall Road (if it can be termed as such) and Gandhi Chowk. On the main road to Khajjiar.  Parking: On the road. Could be a problem if the hotel is full.   Rooms: Comfortable and large. Could do with a mini bar.  Food: Good spread and delicious. Minor repetition after 2-3 days.

kangra,My review is based on the price I was charged which was 4500/night so keep in mind while reading. Mine was a unplanned trip so had to book it since nothing else was available. To say the least try not to book this hotel as the rooms are like boxes and the parking is worst possible you can imagine with cars going down only one way and had to taken out in reverse. See pic. It's best as a sub 2.5k priced hotel. There are waiters spitting on terrace n throwing down dirty water on the road below the hotel. Worst is on being caught in the act instead of apologising they give you a dirty look. God Bless this hotel n people who visit there.

kangra,The actual town of Dalhousie is rather tiny and largely composed of the region in and around Gandhi chowk. This makes the location of Hotel Mongas rather perfect for the budget traveller as otherwise getting around Dalhousie with its meandering roads either implies long walks through traffic choked streets (during tourist season) or paying an exorbitant amount for short distances thanks to the monopoly of the taxi union there. We had to pay Rs.200/- for a five minute less than 2 kms ride on the morning when we needed to catch our bus to Dharamshala (which ironically was also the cost for the 100 plus km ride by bus). Mongas also has a lovely view of the surrounding hills and i suspect of the pir panjal range but unfortunately for us it was cloudy all the days we were there. ,Arpita J,/Profile/ArpitaJ,Bangalore,40

Staff was very helpful as they has dedicated people to specific rooms..The best attraction was DJ night & Karaoke night organized by the hotel in the open terrace restaurant. Got an opportunity to sit with the the owners & they were really good and grounded people.

The room was neatly decorated and it included flower arrangement also(if you ask for it).The location of my room was superb. The snow capped Dhauladhar mountain range could be seen from my balcony.

It took them half an hour more to clean the room while we had to cool our heels on their garden which was not a garden at all. Do not get fooled in by the pictures on their website - the hotel resembles nothing but a construction site - they are even reconstructing their reception which shocked us. If u're reconstructing your hotel - why open it to the public and charge high rates. The rooms were pathetic with torn sofa covers and pathetic carpeting.
