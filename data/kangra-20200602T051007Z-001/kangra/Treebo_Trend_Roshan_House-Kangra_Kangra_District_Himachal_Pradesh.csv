So, my disappointment started there when I learnt there are absolutely no activities in the property for children or adults. No swimming pool no gym no play area and forget all of these, the view from the rooms facing the entrance is so pathetic that u can't even keep your curtains open despite the rooms being so small that u would at times desperately want to open the balcony and breathe in some fresh air.  One thing which I liked about this property is the food and the guys who serve at their restaurant - they are very courteous and take good care of guests. The property is new and well maintained.  My disappointment is not with this",Jyotsna,/Profile/Jyots,"New Delhi, India",30
kangra,"We were 8 and were on a family holiday in June 2018. We were extremely happy with the Hotel Rooms and not to be missed is the roof top restaurant. This has the best view so far. We even asked for another night, but this was not available. We were amazed by the hospitality of Mr.Rohit and the other gentleman(name forgotten). We would only go back to McLeodGanj if we stay here.",Gautam A,/Profile/GAUTAMCHITRA,"Brisbane Region, Australia",50
kangra,"A pleasant stay in near vicinity of Main Mcleodganj square , i would recommend top floors to be taken if you want a view as ground floors does not provide the same . An advice to fellow tourist this hotel doesn't have a lift so for any meals which are not ordered in the room u have to climb all the way to terrace restaurant cum dining. Rest staff behaviour starting from reception to room service, food and stay is very good .",BeniBlack,/Profile/BeniBlack,"New Delhi, India",40
kangra,"The hotel is located almost 3 kms away from bus stop. The taxi would cost 200 INR to the hotel.   It's a small property with very less rooms (16 rooms in total). The rooms & bathrooms are pretty clean. The balcony of the semi-deluxe rooms faces the access road to the hotel.   The roof top cafe has a nice view. The food served is good and the service by the staff is excellent. Always ready to help.   Dal lake is very close to the hotel (950m), while Naddi sunset point is 3 Km. It will be a good hike. Though the sunset point is nothing extra-ordinary. A small cafe , always over crowded with people. We took a walk to Bhagsu fall from the hotel, a very pleasant 5 kms hike. Dalai lama temple is 3.5 km away.   There are no good cafe or restaurants close to the hotel.",17chinmaym,/Profile/17chinmaym,"New Delhi, India",40

The rooms are clean, nicely furbished and beds are wonderfully comfortable. The staff treated me like a princess, were incredibly polite, helpful and caring. The food in the Hotel restaurant is among the best I had in McLeod. If you are looking for a western standard yet still affordable place to stay, Roshan house is a safe bet.",snidon,/Profile/snidon,,50

Just the amount surprised me a bit for veg pakora it was less in quantity and price was 100 rs. Whereas for bread pakoda its 60rs. But they serve 4 pieces.

kangra,"A wonderful place to stay in, not far from Mcleodganj and on way to Dharamsala's so called 'Dal Lake' and 'Setting Sun Point'.  Friendly, helpful and courteous staff always eager to serve with a smile. Tidy rooms with well kept fixtures, clean Air conditioners & fans, clean and well equipped bathrooms and neat linen.  However, the towels provided to us were not sparkling white as was claimed in the placards placed in each room. The rooftop restaurant presents  a magnificent view of the sprawling deodars and distant mountains.  We had our dinner in the restaurant and were quite satisfied with the quality of food. It was so tasty that we devoured all that we had ordered though the portions served were quite large. The breakfast was, however, just ordinary.

kangra,"We took a 3 day trip to Mcleodganj and would recommend this hotel for a lot of reasons. Friendly staff, allowed early check-in, great terrace restaurant with amazing view, clean rooms and great service.  Would recommend if you have own car/ rented bike or scooty/ taxi. It lies midway between Naddi/ dal lake and Mcleodganj main square, so everything is close by but finding an auto is difficult. We rented a scooty from the hotel itself and went around the town. Here is the itinerary- Day 1- Reached early, checked-in at 8 am (thanks to the staff), went to Dalai Lama temple, had breakfast at 'one two cafe', saw HH Dalai Lama(sheer luck).  Then went to dharmsala on scooty-  saw the stadium and war memorial. Back by 5:30 pm, went to Naddi view point and enjoyed watching snow covered",SwatiVIP,/Profile/SwatiVIP,,50

The bonus was the rooftop restaurant. We unexpectedly ate dinner here and were very satisfied with the high quality food. Good breakfast also.

kangra,"I rarely if ever write a negative review but the dishonest and unprofessional behavior of the owner merits this one. The bathroom in our room was dirty. The towels had brown and pink stains on them and the toilet was covered in urine stains and looked as if it had not been cleaned in a while. When we pointed it out, the owner showed up with a dry towel (no cleaning supplies or sanitizing anything) and pretended to clean the toilet. We ended up having to clean it ourselves after he had left. The night before our check out, the owner informed me that I would have to pay cash despite the hotel's listing clearly stating that credit card payment was available. When we told him that we did not have sufficient cash on hand, he said that the credit card reader was not working. He said",Ran N,/Profile/rann356,Washington DC,10

Location of the hotel is peaceful away from main McLeodganj market. Restaurant was at great location actually at roof top and there was awesome view from dinning table. Will come again for sure.

Wonderful location, 3 km scenic walk to the Buddhist monastery, shorter walk to the market. Lovely view of the mountains & the valley, superior service, excellent food in the restaurant on top floor & extremely friendly staff who go out of their way to help. Rooms are clean, spacious & well-lit. One thing that we were especially impressed with is that the hotel offers complementary room & food for drivers of private vehicles.

Came to know about Roshan House from someone and gave them a call. Mr. Rajesh helped us a great deal. He offered us a great and comfortable room. The restaurant food, room service etc all were top notch. Only thing didn't work for us was their wifi internet. The view from the hotel is good and it's situated very near to the main market of mcleodganj. In fact the location of the hotel is the best overall. Not away and not close too. It really makes for a peaceful stay. Thank you so much. I really recommend this hotel to everyone.

We arrived very early after a night bus and we were shown straight to our room.   Clean, bright and comfortable with its own balcony and good Tv channels so we could zone out and recover from the journey.   The rooftop restaurant was a delight. Sheer joy, taking coffee on the low chairs watching the black hawks hunting in the valley below.   The only downside was the 20 minute walk to the town, but if this hotel was closer it would have been out of our price range. A great find.
