The hotel has an excellent view from the rooms as well , there is a clean well maintained garden and a small pond with ducks to add to the ambience , parking is abundant and safe , the last 300 meters is narrow but inspite of me having a toyota fortuner i could manage it without any issues at all .... bcoz hardly any oncoming vehicle was there during my 2 days stay , to be totally tension free use the hotel taxi for basic movements to McLeod ganj or other day tours ar very reasonable fares .

kangra,A good hotel to stay. View from the balcony of room is very good. A bit disappointed with the speed of the service as it was quite slow. It might be due to the holiday season as property was fully booked. But still it was slow. Although nice property very good staff. Reaching the hotel will be a task as half Kms stretch to the hotel is very difficult to drive as their is very narrow road and it becomes difficult to drive to the hotel if any vehicle comes in front.

How-ever, we felt that it can be more professionally managed but we need to appreciate the fact that all the staff we have seen are less than or around 25 years old and are doing everything on their own.  Only issue we faced is that the receptionist missguided us about availability of food, when we called on our way and informed him that by the time we arrive it will be about 2~3 PM..  When we arrived around 2-00 PM, we were told that their kitchen is closed but they will arrange the food from their other establishment in 20 minutes and took more than 45 minutes and we ended up taking our lunch after 3-30PM.

It is located at the end of a road.  To the right is a field of wheat and rapeseed - the yellow blossoms giving quite a show!  We were greeted by a smiling staff with pretty good English.  We were taken to a room and soon found ourselves looking out our balcony at  Dhauladhar range (lit.

The staff was very helpful and polite. They call you for directions as the approach road to the hotel isnt very good. One of the rooms had a small hole in the door because of which we were feeling very cold. As a quick fix, they blocked the hole with a towel.

kangra,"Our three nights stay in this hotel was comfortable. The hotel is not located in Dharamshala but in Sidhpur which is around 30 minutes away from Dharamshala. Location is a bit offbeat and difficult to find out, but once you reach the place the calm and serene surroundings will definitely draw your attention.  All basic amenities are available and services are satisfactory. Food is good. Only would like to draw the attention of management towards up-keeping the rooms like I found some small ant like insects roaming all over the room. Dis-infecting the rooms on a regular basis may help. Little more care should be taken about bed linens etc. The lawn and open area need to be maintained. A dry and withered lawn does not give a 'feel good' feeling! Hope the management takes my words",Rupa,/Profile/Rupa25,"Kolkata, India",40
kangra,"It was my family trip to Dharmshala and I was looking for a good hotel there. On the website I could not get many choices and then I booked this hotel online. When I was about to reach the hotel, the connecting road was broken and therefore, we have to take another route to reach the hotel. The hotel has provided an escort to show the way. The lanes were very narrow and in no case two vehicle can pass through together. The hotel is located litter on outer side of the city, however it is good as there was no sound of vehicles, crowd etc. It was a pleasant stay there. The view of the hills was very nice. The room was spacious and clean provided with a big balcony. You can feel the positive aura of the hotel as it was so peace. The staff was courteous and friendly.

Situated in a peaceful tibetean neighbourhood, just a 5 minute walk from Norbulingka institute and 25 minute ride from mcloud ganj (400 rupies by taxi) lays this true jem. The rooms are specious and very clean with a porch to a beautiful view of terraces and the mountains, from our room you could hear the peaceful  streaming water of one of the water channels. The whole staff were so kind and helpful, always with a smile and wanting to go the extra mile to make their guests happy.

kangra,Fortunate to have stumbled upon this wonderful hotel! This property is located outskirts of Dharamsala near the Norbulinga institute! It was seamless interaction with Mr. Chobyang from booking and other communication. The resort is located in a magnificent landscape that will leave you breathless. Fortunate that we were there last week when there was fresh snowfall. The mountain ranges were all snow capped and it was nearly full moon times. It was dream come true to see the snow capped mountains in the milky moonlight! Jaw dropping views of the mountain ranges and the lush green fields in front with interestingly colored trees unleashing the vibrancy of the spring added to the flavor. The resort staffs were so courteous and gentle. They always served us with a smile! The food,shanki76,/Profile/shanki76,"Singapore, Singapore",50
