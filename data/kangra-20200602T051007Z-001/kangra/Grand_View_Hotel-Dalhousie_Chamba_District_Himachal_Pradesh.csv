The hotel person can guide you where exactly to park.  It's a huge property with stunning view of the valley. I was lucky enough to get a room in their old structure. That had a very Royal and rustic feel to it. Structure primarily of wood, is a feel good factor.  Let me list the things my room had: Extended seating and dinning area.

There were good choices of food and quality was also good. The staff were very courteous. Only issue with the hotel is the location. One has to walk up to the reception for  at least fifty feet and obviously difficult for the elderly especially in the rains because the walkway gets slippery. Moreover,  the restaurant is situated at one end and there's a walkway in the open. We experienced a thundershower throughout our stay and had to walk to the restaurant morning and night through biting cold rain water.

Food buffet was nice with live music during dinner, the hotel owner herself takes good care and follow ups from the customers. Nothing much to say about, its perfect in all respects.

kangra,My wife daughter and I spent 2 nights at this wonderful hotel. It was really worth the money. we got a package that included breakfast and lunch and we were not disappointed. A few tips about this hotel. 1) If you are driving this hotel is at the main bus stand but the parking is across the road on a bit of an incline. It will say Dalhousie club. 2) If you really want to experience a bit of nostalgia then please do not take a room in the new wing. These rooms are like any hotel. Take a room at the old wing which has 15 foot plus high ceiling. The floor the ceiling are completely wooden and the view outside is pretty good. Just outside are little tables and chairs which has really good views and great place to have a cup of tea or a beer which you can buy across the hotel. 3) The,bawagoldi,/Profile/bawagoldi,"Noida, India",50

Modern comforts in terms of televisions and washrooms of the modern variety have been taken care of for the traveller of today.

kangra,When you are in hill stations like Dalhousie all you dread is a good view from the room you stay and this property Grand View Hotel provides it the best you can have in this region. From every single room you have an amazing view and it mesmerizes you every time you look outside from your window or balcony.  There were 2 things which I did not like that much but can understand their problems for this. One is they are very rigid with their bookings. Now that has to be when you are always fully booked and specially during prime seasons. Second being the entrance which really makes you work out. It is around 30-40 metres before you reach the reception but then the walk is worth it. From amongst the greenery all around. What else do you need.  Reception is small but why would you,Review Wala,/Profile/reviewwala,"Kolkata, India",50

They took care of every single bit of our requirements. This was truly remarkable. Starting from the room to the food and the servicing of every single person was amazing and truly worth mentioning.

The Hotel is gorgeous with an old wing of Victorian Architecture and there's a new Luxury wing. We stayed in the new wing, top floor and we had a room overlooking the valley. The dance of the clouds passing by made sitting in the balcony worth it. We stayed for 3 days and availed a MAP plan. I would highly recommend the dinner there. Three things stood out, one, the staff was extremely courteous. One staff personnel took a keen interest in us and made sure we had everything while we ate. Two, Radhika is a lovely host. She would mingle with the guests every night during dinner and she remembered your nane as well. Was a pleasant surprise",kedar_singh00,/Profile/kedar_singh00,"Mumbai, India",50

Men need to carry your luggage on their heads to get you to the reception. The walk to the reception is steep and there is very little access for the disabled. Wifi connectivity is very poor.  So much for all that isn't right.   Here is what is truly breathtaking. The view from the lawns will knock your socks off. The old rooms are perhaps more than worth the money you spend. The lawns/sitting area outside the main building are manicured, clean and I would give the entire ambience a 5 star rating on its own. But there is more.

kangra,We stayed here as a family of four for four nights (Children aged 11 and 13) In April 2104 as part of a three week visit to Himachal Pradesh. It is an old colonial outpost built by the British military to escape the heat of the India summers. there is no point comparing a hotel like this to modern western hotel or resort hotels because it and Its setting is so unique and for this reason makes it quite amazing. When we stayed here we were the only westerners as the peak season was just about to get started. The hotel is rather grand and majestically perched on a sheer mountain side with the most spectacular views of the Himalayas I have ever seen.

The only point to note is that there is a steep steps and walk of 100m from main road towards the hotel lobby and cars wouldn't reach the lobby.

The owners themselves are quite involved and are always there to assist with anything you need. The arrangement of Bonfire and games had one of the maximum attendance I have ever experienced. This talks volume about its quality and involvement. The rooms, reception and Kitchen are quite spread out but there was a very prompt service and you had someone attend you at the drop of a hat.

As soon as we reached there, we were simply mesmerized by the hospitality and words suddenly fell short of describing the utter pleasure that we felt upon beholding the 180 degree Grand view of the mountain range, right from our bed.

First time i have come across a hotel where owners themselves are so invloved to make their guests feel comfortable. The food is amazing and they keep  in mind about guests travelling with small kids and always keep a dish or two in there dinner buffet suitable for kids. I travelled with my husband and a 4 year old daughter...had a wonerful time here. Will definitely recommend this property.,Amrit16,/Profile/Amrit16,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50

It was just like home made food. We met Miss. Radhika and she personally took the feedback and we were happy with the way things were going.  The only problem we had was our room was on ground floor and the floor on 1st floor was of woods. Whenever anyone walked on 1st floor above our room we can hear the foot taps.

kangra,"This is a 110 year old property which has th same wooden flooring & doors that it had 110 years ago. The view is very nice from its garden. The garden is very wel maintained....took a lot of shots of the different flowers in the garden. The staff was very helpful & courteous. The food quality was pretty good. However, the rooms need a bit of periodic maintenance...which i made it clear to the owner of the hotel too. The rooms could need some modernisation...maybe an LCD would be better than the 21"" CRT...the remote of the TV was not working properly....the bathroom drainage needed upkeep. I thought that the room was dimly lit...no tubelights / white lights ...only yellow bulbs. They have garden deluxe rooms which open up into the garden too...and semii-deluxe rooms on the first",J_Bad76,/Profile/J_Bad76,"Doha, Qatar",30

The climate was just about chilly to make you feel cozy and nice. With regards to the hotel well It‚Äôs one of the best properties in Dalhousie. The first thing you notice about the hotel is its old-world charm. The building is a 19th century one with genuine pine wood flooring. The hotel makes u comfortable and keeps u warm with its wooden interiors built during the British era. It is very close to the main market and bus stand.

The hotel has a sitting facilities outside in open which gives a good view of the adjoining areas.    The hotel is made of wood and let u feel the luxury of old palace.  The breakfast and food is excellent.  We used to have buffet dinner in the hotel and they serve good food.  I would recommend to taste dal khichadi there.  It was great and more so in a cold climate.  Good Clean Hotel, Big Rooms, and Good Food.  Overall a first choice at Dalhousie.....",Vishal_Shah,/Profile/Vishal_Shah,Mumbai,50
kangra,"Raj era hotel built in 1937. Old but comfortable and clean. Original wood floors are a pleasure to look at and to walk on. View of Chamba Valley is magnificent (and over it all, finally appearing on my last morning, the snow-covered peaks). Room was very cold the first night and I asked in the morning for a space heater. Using it enabled me to feel comfortable the second night. Staff welcoming and competent. Breakfasts good, shower OK. The hotel is a 15 minute walk from Ghandi Chowk (the main market) which has a fine restaurant, Kwality (looks a little grubby but the food is good and the staff is friendly and efficient).",Paul K,/Profile/go2places,California,30
