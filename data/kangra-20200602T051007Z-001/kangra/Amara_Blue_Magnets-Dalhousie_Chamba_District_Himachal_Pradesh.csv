When we called while booking we asked them how far was gandhi chowk ( the place where the mall road is which is the main tourist spot of dalhousie) they told us that it is 1 km away which was a big lie as it is about 5km away from the hotel. The hotel is not in Dalhousie it is in Banikhet which does not have anything.All the places people wish to visit like khajjiar and panchpula are very far from the hotel. It takes about 400-500 bucks to travel to any nearby place using taxi and the time taken to travel  is around half an hour.

kangra,"We had a three day stay planned in Dalhousie and came across this hotel when making our bookings. Overall a nice and and clean hotel to stay in and has a great view from the hotel rooms. For the price they charge, it was a very good option. Since we had traveled with the family, this was a good choice as the hotel is quite family friendly. The hotel staff was friendly and always prompt in responding to our requests. The owners of the hotel take keen interest in the needs of the guests and that was quite pleasing. We had at least one meal at the hotel on all three days and the staff ensured that we were served hot food and also paid attention to keeping the dining area neat and tidy. The main chef too came asking me for feedback on a couple of occasions and in case we had special",Jai B,/Profile/jaibhatia,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",50

It was clean, stylish, roomy with excellent service where we had our lunch and dinner. Food was beyond good and service was attentive and efficient. Room itself was well equipped and comfortable. I could go on but suffice it to say I was very pleased with the stay, and although short and sweet this time, I hope to be back for a longer visit in the future.",Trip158190,/Profile/Trip158190,,50
kangra,"Hotel Blue magnet was a very good hotel to stay in Dalhousie. We had a very homely experience in that Hotel. The staff of the hotel too were very helpful polite. Especially the owner Mrs. Khurana, she was a wonderful lady. She went all her way out to give us lovely food for all the days that we stayed in. For the price the quantity of food was excellent. The quality was very lovely. We would certainly recommend this hotel for staying. Our room especially was having a lovely view. However a bit of attention should be given on the cleanliness of the bathroom and also  the cleaning of the rooms should be done on a daily basis if at least not changing the bed sheets daily although Mrs Khurana never ever once in all our stay refused us for anything it was always done or provided.",nevilleavari,/Profile/nevilleavari,"Mumbai, India",40

kangra,"I visited this hotel last month and had booked a room in Supreme category with breakfast and dinner.  The only thing I liked about this place was the hospitality of the staff. The staff members were quite cooperative.  Though my one-day stay here was quite troublesome and we faced a lot of issues.   To begin with, when we were taking the bath, the water supply stopped in the middle and water was unavailable for the next half an hour. We were left shivering in the middle of the bath.   The bedsheets and pillow covers were not clean. Even the bathrooms lacked the basic hygiene required.  The dinner was not good and I just pecked at a few bites. There were only a limited number of options in the breakfast menu.  We turned on the TV but no channel was live. We called the room",Kunika,/Profile/Kunika,"New Delhi, India",20

kangra,This hotel is 5 kms away from dalhousie so its a reasonably quiet place.  We booked 3 adjacent rooms and to our surprise Every room is different from other. It took us a while to decide which room to choose!! At this price you wont get such good rooms even in banikhet forget dalhousie. Banikhet market is 2-3 min walk from the hotel. This hotel is highly recommended. Staff is very friendly. Food can be a bit more spicy. Do try paranthas and omlette in breakfast.,ayush2016,/Profile/ayush2016,"Chandigarh, India",40

People were willing to pay any amount to just to get a room but the owners were so honest they did not charge big bucks for the room rather they provided discount which they could at that time too.. we experienced the best hospitality on the part of the owners and the staff.. they cooperated a lot. I would rate full marks to this hotel on the grounds of their hospitality and food and its a new property so absolutely clean and good..",Aman K,/Profile/amank623,,50

Full marks to the owners and undoubltedly the best hotel with extreme care and concern. The rooms are neat and clean with all facilities. Allthemore, the food served was very good. I stayed from 7th June to 10th June and the best part is that the owners take special care. Whenever I shall visit again I will prefer the same hotel.

kangra,"I opted for this hotel after seeing the reviews, especially personal care taken by khurana couple the owners of the property. And they didn't disappoint me, we checked in very late at around 11.30 PM yes very late in the night due to unexpected delay in my train , but to my pleasant surprise both Mr and Mrs Khurana were anxiously waiting for us, served us with good hot food at that late hour. This property is under construction and so has some short comings but personal care and hospitality by owners surpasses all short comings. Good Punjabi food, good location ,nice and spacious rooms and bathroom. Dining area is under construction. Owners should provide wifi facility to inmates as it would be of great help for them ,in all I would recommend this hotel for family stay.",drviveksaxena,/Profile/drviveksaxena,"Kanpur, India",40

I Could watch birds directly from my balcony. Wow! The rooms are really spacious, and give 5 star like a feeling. Excellent service. The owners are such a lovely couple with great hospitality. There was personal attention to all details, including food. O yes! food was extraordinarily tasty. We really enjoyed our stay here and wished we had more days in hand to extend our vacation. In addition to the all this, they have got fabulous apparel store in the same building, which is quite reasonable in prices.",Kavita B,/Profile/KavitaB206,,50

It's 6km away from main Gandhi Market but who cares if you get such service from the complete staff and owners.   On our request owner has made Dham traditional food of HP. It's was fabulous in taste. Owner personally looks to each and every family, like to know there likes and dislikes in food which you can't expect in any of the hotel.

kangra,Terrible? No more than terrible. Just to sum up don't book a room in this hotel. You may cancel your trip to Dalhousie but don't spoil your holidays by staying in this hotel. There is no hospitality at all and no basic facilities. We had a buffet package which was not served to us due to their personal issues. The food was average. Due to construction you won't be able to get peace since the workers continue doing their work even after we asked the manager to stop and it's disturbing. ,jagrit20,/Profile/jagrit20,"New Delhi, India",10

There are still a few development happening in hotels as they are developing a rooftop restaurant and club house and all.

kangra,"We were enroute to Dalhousie and due to fresh snowfall road was closed near banikhet. So with small child in chilling weather we had no option but to take this hotel. This is how i rate it:  The Pros - Great Rooms - Good Food - Since this is a family managed accommodation, owner's son was kind enough to give us his jio mobile for the night for internet since their broadband wasn't working   The Cons - Zero Rated Room Service  - NO GENERATOR BACKUP  - don't care to give blankets for extra beds in freezing weather. Extra bed was a joke for 1000 a night. - NOT EQUIPPED TO HANDLE SMALL CHILDREN - HEATERS ARE CHARGED RS 300 each - DONT ACKNOWLEDGE BOOKINGS FROM TRAVEL SITES LIKE MAKEMYTRIP as i saw a couple suffer the refusal of the owner who sold out cashing the inclement weather",Gaurav Dua,/Profile/GD87,"Jammu City, India",30

This  hotel suffer power failure whole night during our stay, and owners of the hotel says it is due to power failure from govt. but it is false as all other hotels have electricity. In night he arrange buffet food in thermocol plates and eat it in standing mode which is very difficult for kids and charge 250.00 per person for that tasteless food. In morning tea will come without your request knocking door and asking in each room whether you want tea with so many cups in a tray.and then owner come to say do not use gyeser for bath due to power shortage in such -1C temp. At checkout when we complain for all these he says he will do nothing. For all these he has charged rs 9300.00 for 2 rooms",Susheel J,/Profile/SusheelJ15,,10
