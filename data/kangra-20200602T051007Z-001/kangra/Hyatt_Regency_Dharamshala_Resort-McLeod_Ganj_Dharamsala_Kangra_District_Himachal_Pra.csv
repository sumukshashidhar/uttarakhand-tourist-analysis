kangra,"No wonder almost all of them rated 5 out of 5 for this hidden gem in Dharamshala. Why I am saying hidden because very few cabbies have any idea about this hotel. Once you are there, you forget everything else as you enter a different world which is comparable only with heaven. What we will never forget is the view of the Dhauladhar range from your room window or balcony.  It was simply stunning! It became all the more enjoyable when we found an extremely passionate team at work all over the resort 24/7. I really wonder how did the management of this hotel motivate such a huge workforce on top of a hill where logistics could be a day-to-day challenge.

But the road leading to hotel from McLeodGanj is extremely narrow, always traffic congestion and lots of delays, try leaving early for airport.  AND.. Lots of chaos in the morning during breakfast time, coordination of the staff seemed quite poor... our breakfast order, between the order taking staff to passing to another one, until it reached the kitchen, got translated.
