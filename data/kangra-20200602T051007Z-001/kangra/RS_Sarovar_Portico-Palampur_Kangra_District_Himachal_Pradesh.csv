kangra,"Amazing Hotel in a beautiful Palampur town located in the Kangra Valley in Himachal Pradesh. We visited Palampur in second week March 2020. We  had booked the suit room and a room adjutant to that. The room offered spectacular view of Dhuldar Mountain Ranges of Himalayas. The rooms were big with comfortable beds, clean toilets , well maintained  and tastefully designed. Dinner/Lunch at Revolving Restaurant on 7th floor, gazing at scenic landscape and  snow clad mountain ranges, is a great experience. The buffet was just about satisfactory, the hotel should consider offering a wider spread. The spread during our visit was limited. Overall, a hotel worth a stay for its excellent location, well maintained rooms and breathtaking view it offers.",Niranjan G,/Profile/140niranjang,,50

The bar below the revolving restaurant is very good with superb view and so is the revolving restaurant on the top floor. The revolution, however, is very difficult to realize as the speed is very low. I of course don't say that it should revolve at a great speed. But it should be somewhat more than the speed it now revolves as you wouldn't get a chance to see all the sides during your lunch.  Staff are very good.

The rooms are spacious for Himachal standards, seem soundproof (though not confirmed) and come with fine interiors and standard toiletries. Breakfast has a fair choice of options so that is another plus. The staff is courteous and knows how to take care of the choices and preferences of their guests. Revolving restaurant on the top has a limited range to offer, but again it is good to serve less with perfection as this place does, than to mess an elaborate menu up.  This place lacks a spa and for this reason falls one step short of perfection, but I still would rate it a 5/5 for the value for money one",Gaurav Gautam,/Profile/gaurav_gautam17,,50

kangra,">The following is my personal viewpoint and is in no way intended to disrepute the hotel.< Stayed here for 5 nights with family (including 2 kids 10-12yr old) in May after reading TripAdvisor reviews. If you are a nature lover looking for a vacation place away from hustle-bustle of city life then this is not the place for you. It is situated bang on a congested and busy road in a local market and amidst congested residential Gugghar town. The view of Dhauladar mountain range from hotel rooms is excellent though we were unfortunate to witness only very scanty snow on the Dhauladar bcos of little snowfall back in winters. As for vacation, 2-3 days of stay is enough if you wish to wander around.

It is hard to put in words the absolute awe that one feels gazing up at the mountains which put on a real show for us one evening when there was not the trace of a single cloud anywhere around.  The rays of the setting sun bounced of the snow capped peaks in a glittering burst of silver that simply took our breath away.  The weather changes continuously at this high altitude and the cloud cover is never too far away.  On the day we checked in we enjoyed our lunch at the Cloud 7 revolving restaurant and it took a real effort to keep our eyes on the plates in front of us - the scenery is picture postcard like!

The rooms are too good and very reasonably priced .....The complementary breakfast has got good options and is very good ..  the revolving restaurant at 7th floor is very good to dine and buffet is very cheap though the food is ok but ambience does add the flavour....The bar at 6th floor is very reasonably priced you get blenders pride for as low as Rs90/- a peg... So not required to carry your own bottle .. again snacks are limited in Choice and need improvement... The staff is too good and always welcoming you with smile on face ...

It was then when we came across this property. Post reading the reviews we decided to book the hotel for a 4 day stay.  On arrival we were upgraded to a junior suite which had a mesmerising view of the Dhauladhar Ranges. The same can be seen in the pics i have posted. Mr. Dinesh the GM and his entire staff was extremely hospitable. This is a fairly new property and has been well kept.  The only thing I probably missed was the variety during the breakfast buffet. The food in hotel is very well done with great taste.  The bar and the roof top revolving restaurant had great views to offer.

Given the hotel was quite new there were some issues such as the internet but they were overwhelmed by the hospitality of the staff. The rooms were nice and clean. The dinner at the revolving restaurant was scrumptious. The breakfast and the service were just phenomenal. I loved the fact that we lingered around till noon and there was no rush from the staff. Extremely courteous staff. The view from the Terrace was beautiful. A special shout out to the manager, Mr. Dinesh Tiwari who looked out for us and also helped us arrange our para gliding experience.

In my opinion its your best bet for creature comforts in the area. It is not located bang in the middle of touristy Dharamshala and Mcleodganj but honestly thats a good thing. You could do a day trip to  both and be back. Though Palampur town doesnt have any of the touristy vibe, if you prefer the hustle bustle than you may not like the location  What works for the property  - Brand new, everything is fresh and shiny - Personalised service  - Decent Food though breakfast service may be limited - Revolving restaurant at the rooftop is worth one meal  Couldn't really fault the property but we were amongst the first few guests to stay",TwoHappiFeet,/Profile/TwoHappiFeet,"Mumbai, India",50
