kangra,We recently stayed at this property and really enjoyed the property with a scenic view of the snow capped mountains. The restaurant was amazing and the service by Puneet and team was awesome. The chef was at his best everyday.   The room don't have any centralized heating and a split ac is provided in the room which is not optimal at times. The washroom is super chilly always due to this and only drawback of this property.  The overall staff was really great - the reception responded well and Mahi at the Spa was amazing.,Marc Mathews,/Profile/Fatpigeon72,,40
