kangra,"We stopped for a quick lunch at Kangra Rodeway. Famished after our morning part of tour, we also needed a place to freshen up.  And the facilities were classy. Don't have any complaints with that. However, the service was slow. We had to wait for about 30-40 minutes for the order to arrive at our table.  The food though, was piping hot and looked healthy. We had our stomach full. The nans were crisp and the vegetables cooked tender, just the right amount of sweet and spice.  Could have been a experience I'll never forget if only the service was fast.

kangra,I travelled with my family on 19th april.  Due to an medical emergency we needed to book a hotel near the tanda medical hospital. It is monopoly for this hotel as it only sole property there.  We were not allowed to share 1 room for 3 people & it became an obligation for us to take 2 rooms instead.  Rooms were small in size with seepage at many places. Although bath fittings are newly installed with old tiles. Bathroom amenities such as oil & slippers were not provided as they didnt have it. No towels were there in bathrooms we called up thrice for small things. Food was good which we really liked during the dinner but breakfast buffet is very small with very limited options.  Even they dont provide coconut chutney with sambhar.  It was a constrain for us book this hotel,Akhil M,/Profile/153akhilm,,20
kangra,The hotel is located on the highway just outside the city . Very clean rooms and washrooms . We stayed there for one night  . The big big flowers in the rooms are a little funny but overall the property is good . They have a buffet breakfast for which they charge very genuine like they charged Rs 150 per person . Overall it was good and worth staying ,gazal12345,/Profile/gazal12345,"Muktsar, India",40

kangra,Stayed there for one night with family. Found location to be good out of the city and on the main high way. Near to Kangra mata mandir. Food was fine except the breakfast which could have been better. Roof top hotel is good and views are nice.,kavish_13,/Profile/kavish_13,faridabad,40
kangra,"this hotel being a new property is extremely clean. The rooms, washrooms, common areas are free of any sort of dirt/grime. Hospitality, food and views are average. There is a stony dry river which flows behind the hotel. The location is serene and congestion free. I booked a room for 3200 and found this value for money especially in peak season. They even play pleasant music in the corridors! ",shalini m,/Profile/875shalinim,"Chandigarh, India",40
kangra,"Kangra, about 20 kms away from Dharamsala, is known mostly for its hindu temples. The place is small so its nice to see some hotels coming up on in this region.   Rodeway inn is about 5 kms away from the main temple in Kangra ji. Look wise the hotel is modern. There are no other buildings in the vicinity of the hotel and hence the hotel offers great views of the valley and the far-away snow clad peaks.  The rooms in this hotel are decently sized. They are quite tacky in design (see pics) with massice red flowers hanging from the ceilings. Otherwise the rooms are modern. There are little niggling problems in the hotel, like the bathroom door that wouldn't lock, or the shower that wouldn't function, or the erratic hot water supply.   Room service in the hotel is fast and the staff",Abhishek Jain,/Profile/jainauee,Noida,30

kangra,"We stopped by at the hotel for a meal on our way to Kangra. There are a few dhabas nearby but we didn't really feel like sitting by the side of the highway and eating a rushed meal, so we tried the restaurant at Rodeway Inn.  We ordered some Indian fare and it was simply delicious. The dal makhani was absolutely fresh and we had requested for it to be non-spicy, so it was made according to our instructions. The egg bhurji and thin, crisp butter naans made this one of the best meals we ate during our trip. They also offer a good variety of Chinese and continental dishes.  The hotel has a beautiful view of the valley and clean, hygienic facilities. I would recommend the place to anyone for a stopover and a hot, fresh, yummy meal.",irina_kahlon,/Profile/irina_kahlon,"New Delhi, India",40
