kangra,Recently my wife and I stayed for 5 nights at The Pavilion Hotel .  We were really very satisfied with our experience and would be comfortable recommending it .The location is on a hill and the hotel overlooks the valley . From the patio and pool the view is really great. The rooms are done up well but are a bit small. Pay for and book a Valley view room - pointless facing inwards when the view is so nice.The food is pretty good and special thanks to the very helpful Chef Partha Sarkar for making off menu items on request. Also special mention of Ms Shiwani Chetri of Front Office for overall facilitation and for guidance re sight seeing.People make a hotel move from  good to great !

The rooms here are quite spacious and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The food served here is awesome. I totally loved it. The breakfast buffet offers you a wide variety of options to choose from with new items everyday. The room service is also nice. And while you're having your breakfast in the restaurant, your room is being cleaned at that time. The rooms have beautiful views. And one can enjoy a cup of tea in the open air seating of the restaurant with the scenic view of the cricket stadium. I had an amazing time here.

The food is good but only if you go for √† la cart menu. The buffet is not up to the mark. There are no restaurants nearby. So, you have to depend on the hotel restaurant. There is no separate bar.

This property is about 1.5 km from Dharamshala cricket stadium and is located at a decent height hence you get some good views from it including a distant view of the cricket stadium itself. Different rooms are available and they are named according to cricket stadium such as Lords, Eden garden. They all provide different views and the rooms are also different for example. The Lords provide good front view of the hills with all wooden floor where as Eden garden is somewhat bigger compared to other rooms and are normal non wooden floor rooms.  The rooms have all the basic amenities with decent cleanliness. But I must admit",Sunddit,/Profile/Sunddit,"Rishikesh, India",50

kangra,"changed our room (CLUB ROOM) 3 times because on checking in - AC not working, phone not working, had to get the dusting done again..   untrained and insufficient restaurant staffing and no manager to overlook their service, could only find the training manager as manager on Duty..   I have no idea why this hotel is so hyped up. Rooms are small, and because of wooden walls and flooring.. everything creeks on every step you take. Complained 3 times to various staff members (as could not find any manager) but in vain.   Asked for the GM, answer was that i should tell the staff everything as GM is not around.   Only one front office staff kept on listening to us but poor guy couldn't do much apart from apologising ...   Only the location is good.",Varun S,/Profile/varuns739,"New Delhi, India",20
kangra,"The hotel is located in a quiet spot far from main town but also easily accessible, if you are planning to visit tourist spots in Dharamshala and around. It is pretty landscaped and kept clean. Some rooms have a sad view on construction site, but I guess this will end as soon as the expansion is completed. Chalets and suites have good view on the valley. Restaurant serve good food, though it takes at least 30-40 min. to get the food ready. Overall service is very responsive and in every case problem solving oriented. The pool is beautifully located with great view on Dhauladhar range and valley. The swimming experience is quite breathtaking, even though the water is very cold.",Bogi,/Profile/bogi2019,"New Delhi, India",40
kangra,Away from the town it's a lovely property. The only place where one can find an infinity pool overlooking the valley. Great views from the multi cuisine restaurant The Hook. Good food too. It's doing well as an extension wing is being constructed there.,NChopra55,/Profile/NChopra55,"Chandigarh, India",40
kangra,Probably the best property in Dharamsala. Awesome views and easily accessible. Everything is close by. Food quality and spread is average and can be much much better. Housekeeping also can be better. Staff is good and courteous. Overall the best in Dharamsala and surely value for money if you ignore the food spread. ,Jay Ashar,/Profile/jayrashar,"Pune, India",40
kangra,"We came to Dharamshala for the Easter long weekend. The staff were incredibly accommodating - especially regarding our rather inconvenient overnight buses from Manali and making sure we were comfortable at all times of the day! The grounds are beautiful and sunset by the infinity pool is a must. Our room was also very comfortable. Only small downsides are that it is a little far from the action McLeod Ganj (but also it was nice to be able to escape that too), and the sauna comes with a 500 rupee charge to use. But overall great!",EmilyZizania,/Profile/EmilyZizania,,50
kangra,Have visited the hotel with my friends and ordered some snacks along with tea. Our servers were attentive and caring. Sorry folks m horrible in remembering names.   Nd need not to mention that it was yum. Its a heaven in another heaven. A dream hotel for cricket crazy fans. Swimming pool nice and tidy. And the view of the city is eye catching. I will be definitely back here with my family nd friends in coming June. I know this post is a bit late. But very well said by some one the better late than never.

kangra,"I must say that being the only 5 star hotel in the entire Dharamshala, this hotel actually is a place worth staying. Initially was opened only for cricketers and now for the common people, this property leaves no stone unturned to give you the best of lavish stay, hospitality and food.   I visited there with my wife and sister in law in the month of Dec-16 and stayed there for 2 nights. Everything from checking in, cosy rooms, wonderful room service, delicious pool side breakfast with options beyond what they have in the menu to check out with a warm goodbye was something that one would remember for a very long time.   Last but not the least, Mr. Sunny Thakur (Hospitality) and Mr. Satish (Chef) are the most humble and down to earth guys who are one of the gems they have in their",chauhanabhay,/Profile/chauhanabhay,"New Delhi, India",50
