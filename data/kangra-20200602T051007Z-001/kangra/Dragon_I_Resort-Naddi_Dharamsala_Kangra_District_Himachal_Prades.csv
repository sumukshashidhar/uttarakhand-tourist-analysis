kangra,"Me and my wife along with our 2.5 yrs daughter visited Mcleodgunj- Naddi during 23rd to 26th January. It was our 1st visit to Naddi as we want to witness snowfall. I would say we have never thought of something like this. A snow clad mountain just few meters away from your balcony. A quiet location in a remote village, where only silence prevails. It was that much quiet that you can hear the sound of winds hitting the pine trees. We have booked super deluxe room and opted for a early check in which they have provided on an additional cost if Rs 840. They have also arranged for pick up from Dharamshala on our request. The room was very very  spacious and well maintained. A room heater was also provided to cope up with harsh chilling weather. Since it was an off season no other",Nishant Sinha,/Profile/23nistri,"Hyderabad, India",40

kangra,Dragon I was easily THE worst hotel that I have stayed at in the past several years.  Location: The hotel is located in Naddi overlooking the Dhauladhar snowcaps. It is around 5 kms from the McLeod Ganj town. A taxi pickup/drop from the hotel to McLeod Ganj costs INR 400 (as of May 2017). The drive up to the hotel has several very steep road sections which needs an expert driver to navigate around. There aren't any options for dining around the resort so you either end up eating in their pathetic restaurant or taking a taxi to McLeod Ganj.

If you would want to run away from the hustle bustle of city life and experience what true nature is, then I cannot stress enough Naddi as the destination. I went here with my wife (both of us being nature lovers) and were truly mesmerised by the beauty and grandeur of this place. There was, at the same time, too much and nothing much to do here. We celebrated three days just walking along the jungle trail most of our time. There was always something to be discovered in the silence of nature.

Hot water was the major issue, the geysers were not in good condition. 2. Some electricity plugs had water leakage, I lost my iPhone charger to it. 3. You need an experienced driver to get to the hotel, a little distorted road, which I guess may be common in the mountains.

Don't bother ordering any tandoori stuff because the cooks can't make them. Bring your food from mclodganj and ask the waiters to warm.it up.

The experience was just beautiful, everything was perfect - the chilled temperature, sweet air, surreal snow covered mountains right in front of you, the peace of nature and sweet sound of waterfall that has a trekking route through the mountains with icy water. The hotel is located in the perfect location that lets you enjoy everything that nature has to offer. The staff are very friendly and helpful, the food gives an aroma of home food and everything is keep very hygiene and clean. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to get in touch with the nature or for anyone who wants to leave all the city hassle behind and enjoy the peace and serenity.",Sarah S,/Profile/sarahsT5460NK,"Hong Kong, null, Hong Kong",50
kangra,"I came to Dragon I with friends for a getaway from Hong Kong. What a contrast!   While the hotel is a short drive from Mccleodganj and the scene there (whether touring the Tibetan Monastery or having a few drinks in the pub), the true beauty of Dragon I is that it is close to many hiking trails - whether for short walks, or full-day or overnight trips. I'm a city person, but I love my hikes, so to be surrounded by the mountains was truly luxury. Which, speaking of, Dragon I is in the foothills of the Himalayas, so I saw the mountains rising above the hotel when I woke up every morning. Wow.  Besides the beautiful natural setting (which I could rave about for days), the experience of staying at Dragon I was like staying in the home of family friends - who spoil you rotten.

kangra,"one of the nicest places i have ever been ... exquisite rooms , great food , the best of all walk out and you are on a trek. definitely a home away from home.   must visit before booking any where else .. :)",minky9999,/Profile/minky9999,"Gurgaon, Haryana, India",40
kangra,"Escape the tumultuous city life and fall amidst clouds,breath taking views, unbelievable culinary delights, and a warm and cosy ambiance. Choose to stay in the luxurious suites or the loft conversion rooms, one thing is guaranteed, you will always have a room with a view. There are quite a few interesting walking trails and tucked away water falls. Bring along your yoga mat, and allow yourself to be lost in divinity or put on your hiking boots and go conquer the great Himalayas, or simply sit in the patio taking it all in. Dragon I is the perfect getaway, run by Col Pathania, it has a feeling of a 'home in the hills', his war time stories adding just that tad bit of excitement to an already perfect setting.   Handy to get to, via road, rail and now convenient flight options,",housefkapaali,/Profile/housefkapaali,"Delhi, India",50
kangra,"Our trip to Dharamsala was fantastic,in June we got rain along the travel but it was cool n dry in Himachal. Punjab highway although managed by state, was the best part of travel with canal running along the road n then Nangal dam. As u enter Himachal roads r in bad shape with repair work goin on, n will take at least a year. Still its worth all the travel once u enter Dharamsala. I would advise to go up as much possible as Dhrmsla is just a town n Mc Leodganj was overcrowded with people n cars, with jams running in hours. So i picked Naddi, its a beautiful place 5kms above Mcleod..in the lap of nature. We stayed at Dragon i resorts n that was the best part.Its a new one with all the amenities of a 3* resort. We took the best rooms there n the view from the balcony was 180",Yatin S,/Profile/547yatins,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",40
kangra,"A visit to the hills is the first thing that features on everybody’s mind, every time the unapologetic summer showers its wrath. But then, where to go and more importantly, where to stay? Not an easy decision. Reason being, as the temperature rises northwards, Delhites too seek respite by fleeing towards north. Many a times, Delhites end up outnumbering the local population of these hill stations. So, our search for a quaint, less crowded and blessed with nature’s bounties, ended at Dragon I resort. Nestled in the lap of nature, facing snowcapped peaks and a cool breeze soothing the senses in the month of May, Dragon I brought a smile on our faces the moment we stepped out of our car. In fact the approach road to the resort is an adventure in itself. Spacious rooms (almost all",JyotirajHazarika,/Profile/JyotirajHazarika,"New Delhi, India",40
kangra,"Awesome location with breath taking snow view. The dirt road leading to the resort is an adventure in itself, just wish I had a 4x4. Okay, coming to the resort, the rooms are quite nicely built with the snow view from almost every 1 of them. The room facilities are much more than basic, i mean it could easily fit in to the boutique category with LCD's, electric blankets, wooden floor, etc. They have an extensive menu with 4-5 different cuisine. Food is quite good. Staff extremely alert & attentive. Free wi fi is a boon. Just about 2 min. walk and u can get taxis if u'd wanna visit around. All in all I would suggest avoid the over crowded mcleodganj and head 5-6 km above to this lovely place. And yes, this resort in easy on the pocket too. Dragon I pls get a card charging machine.",farestay,/Profile/farestay,New Delhi,50
