kangra,"Without doubt one of the favorite resort I stayed during my time in Dalhousie! Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the staff . The staff was extremely friendly, the restaurant very flexible (appreciate this!) and the restaurant supervisor deserves a special thanks. We had one great night here, which obviously also added up to the experience and Memorable with unknown guest . The second day we did a village trekking which was guided by Khan sahab, who works as a private tour assistant in the hotel as well. Khan sahab is such a warm personality and familiar with us easily in trip (recommendable!). I truly enjoyed walking the the hills . The scenery was beautiful and it was a relieve to walk in such a quiet and peaceful environment. The natural bath on the end was a great way",suneel Sharma,/Profile/stunningvivaan,"Kanpur Nagar District, India",50
kangra,"Well, we always wanted to stay at this resort and hence booked it for our trip to Dalhousie May 19-21st 2020, 5 rooms for 5 families. Apparently everything was picture perfect until the lockdown started. The bookings were refundable and we cancelled from Alps website on Mar 25th. The credit was supposed to happen in 7-10 days and we are still waiting. Innumerable phone calls were made, emails sent, no response. Every individual on this planet is perhaps going through the most difficult phase of their life. On one hand, completely emphatize with Alps authorities and we believe they might be closed now. But on the other hand, everybody is running the show from home, be it office or business, using digital mode of communication.

A pleasant delight I must say. The food quality was awesome. Breakfast was exotic. My main concern was that their suits were old fashioned and need a major revamp. For elderly it is a steep climb up the hill and a few stairs before u reach the reception. Need to install a lift for that. No dental or shaving kit provided. No tea/coffee maker in the suit.

It has good views of mountains. It has an open area with swings for small children and play ground for them to run around and another one for sitting and enjoying the view, weather and food. It also has a tree house which was used by my kid quite extensively.

kangra,This was the worst and most expensive hotel of our trip. The whole place was in repair and broken condition... They didn't even bother to clean the snow from the paths..The room was very small and damp! There is wide gap under the door which gave way to lots of noise and freezing cold wind!  It was disappointing and we left this place after the first night...

This property is amazing but definitely needs improvement. the gallery to rooms were dusty and looked like there was renovation going on. I had to ask staff to change the bed sheets as it was not properly cleaned. However food was good and we also enjoyed Bonfire.

Things which definitely need attention: Poorly maintained rooms and service. The first room that we were taken to was dingy, the linens were dirty and the room fittings were dangling out. The second room (1st floor) that we were offered wasn't clean and the flush wasn't working. On threatening to move out and on Expedia’s intervention, they gave us a room (corner most in the ground floor) which was much better although some lights and the geyser were not working even there.

kangra,We stayed at Alps Spa & Resort on 8th & 9th July 2014. It can at the most be called as an unkempt Holiday Home instead of a resort.  It is sad to see such a beautiful property being wasted due to sheer bad management and maintenance. The rooms are okay and the Super Dlx rooms are large but again unkempt. Bed linens are dirty. Toilets are pedestrian. Walls are pockmarked. Food is okay. But the location is beautiful and just after Dalhousie Public School. One of the highest points in Dalhousie and away from the hustle bustle of Gandhi Chowk. And on the way to Khajjiar. The weather was great and the hotel could do with some upkeep.

The website of the hotel does mention some other activites like bikes etc but they are not available. the service is prompt and you can have the food in the garden overlooking the hills with deodar forests. The only major issue with the hotel is its reach for people who cannot climb stairs. The hotel is located after climbing approximately 100 mts from the road.

Not to say that there's a great Mall Road or bazaar in Dalhousie town, which itself is not so great! The property is misleadingly called Alps Spa and Resort, there's no spa here! No other activities either, except a small garden where you can have tea and breakfast and soak the sun if the capricious Dalhosie weather permits it!Rooms are bad. I was upgraded to a Deluxe room and even that was not on par with standard rooms of other decent hotels. The bathroom especially stank due to what appeared to be an improper drainage system.

But the openion changed completely when we reached Alps Resort. We got a space on the parking lot. There was a nice and well maintained lawn sorrounding the hotel. The regular rooms were more than what we expected. Windows facing lawn, clean room and bathrooms. The waiters are very polite... The food however is not that great.

Surroundings are ok easy to get out to travel to Khajjiar which has become very commercialised and full of litter ompared to 10yrs ago when i visited Khajjia last time. The hotel could be of better standard but it appears they are happy with their standards as lack in maintenance.

Its on a Khajjiar road near DPS, quite outside the main city. So if you have your car or wish to have a peaceful stay then this is for you else for someone who wants to stay in the heart of city its a bad experience.   2. Room service and hospitality: It was fantastic and really worth to try. They will cater to all your needs which are practical.  3.  Food: Food was awesome, at least the dishes we tried.
