kangra,"Stayed here 5 nights and room was clean, and bed was very comfy (King size) with great views of the mountain from my bed & room balcony. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Food was nice and cheap, the staff always happy to help and Jagdish in particular  (worked in restaurant) was also most welcoming and always cheerful. The hotel manager was also very kind, and always willing to accommodate any requests. Hotel is situated quite close to Bhagsunag waterfall (approx 1.5-2km away) and was an easy walk there (probably 30-35 mins walk from hotel).  On the downside, my room had no heating (got down pretty chilly at night) and although I had a nice warm duvet blanket, I had to request another blanket, and they quickly provided me with a huge warm blanket.

kangra,Holiday hill is a very nice property. The hotel is at a very nice location.  The view from hotel rooms is very nice. Rooms are very spacious and clean.  They serve tasty food. Hotel also offers private balcony. Hotel is close to mall road. Very peaceful area. Hotel also has private parking space. Only one drawback is the road to the hotel is little bit steep.

I emailed in advance to make sure that they would accept my credit card and they said they did, but when I tried to pay, they would not take it--I had used the card the day before and know it worked, so they essentially lied about it and were quite rude.

Otherwise there are other hotels which are pretty close the market area with better views.There are many issues with this hotel. First thing is that it is not a speciality lodging but just a normal hotel. I guess they listed this property as speciality lodging so that it appears high on the trip advisor ratings.
