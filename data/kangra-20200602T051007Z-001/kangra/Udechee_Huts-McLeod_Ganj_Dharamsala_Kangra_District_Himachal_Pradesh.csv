I heard stories from friends of how beautiful the place is an I thought they were exaggerating. They were not. The view of the mountain is just stunning.

Beautiful location with mountain views, large rooms with comfortable seating (bed could be softer, though), attentive service and great food. The hotel has a large terrace from where to watch the sun rise (if you can bring yourself to getting up early enough). And if you are into sunsets you just had to walk about 200 metres to get to a popular sunset view point. I particularly liked the hotel's motto ""If we liked noise, we wouldn't live here...

For the prices they are charging i would expect a little more luxury than that.

kangra,"Udechee Huts in Naddi, Himachal Pradesh permeats peace, serenity and beauty because of its location, set up and environment. The Hotel is the best located place in Naddi, about ten kilometers away from Mcleodganj. From all the 14 cottages of the hotel, the Dhauladhar range can be seen and 'felt' as if it is there in your courtyard. The morning sun creates all sorts of magic on the snow clad hills. The evening sun set shows you another array of colour-fest. The sparsely populated hamlet has a few huts down below the hotel level with a primary school in the corner. A little far away, there is a meditation centre and an international school. You are amidst green undulated hilly terrain with several layers of mountains on the northern side culminating into the Dhauladhar range.",AsisBandyopadhyay,/Profile/AsisBandyopadhyay,"Kolkata, India",50

The term 'hut' is misleading: the rooms are spacious, clean, well-equipped and with private balconies. I have no hesitation in recommending this to any traveler lucky enough to be visiting Dharamshala or McLeodganj.

Meals are served on the terrace, your room or in the restaurant. My only negative comment is that the restaurant lacked character and that the choice of meals was somewhat limited.

Breakfast was also pretty basic, but when you can sit outside, and read the paper with a backdrop like that you really won't mind that it's not haute cuisine.  The rooms are pretty basic, but have ensuite, and a TV (if you like Bollywood or cricket) and they'll even give you a hot water bottle if it's cold at night, which it was.

We had read the reviews on Tripadvisor & Holiday IQ websites.  Udechee Huts is located in a far corner of Dharamsala.  From that point of view its location is not ideal but that is compensated by the awesome view it offers from its rooms.  Udechee Huts has around 20 independent row houses & only one restaurant. The restaurant  has very limited options & it will be advisable to have your lunch & dinner at the various restaurants available in the main market which is around 20 25 minutes drive frpom the hotel.
