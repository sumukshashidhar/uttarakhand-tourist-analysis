kangra,"I loved it. Away from the city and yet not far. The house structure and architecture was almost Balinese, and raw and earthy. Then a space for lounging, reading and playing. A perfect holiday feel. The caretaker was a blessing. Made us feel safe and comfortable. The homemade breakfast was so good. The third bed in the Triple Bedroom is the best spot. You're sleeping above the stream, and you can hear the sound, and watch the sunrise. And then a morning walk by the fields. All in all, a beautiful space for a break.
