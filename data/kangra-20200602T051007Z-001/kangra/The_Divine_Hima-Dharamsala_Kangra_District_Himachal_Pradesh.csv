We never expected such excellent hospitality in Dharamshala . It’s basically a bungalow turned into a boutique guest house which has combination of both Hotel & a guest house . Yes prices are on a higher side buth worth every penny spent in here . The only negative would be it’s distance from McLeodgunj as all the main attractions are in McLeodgunj, but having said that we explored the city enough to figure out that despite being main city attraction McLeodgunj doesn’t offer such pleasant stay ins , it’s also over crowded and overpriced we felt .

This boutique hotel is clearly a labor of love evidenced by its impeccable design and decor, both inside and out.

Your comfort is their priority and it is done with warmth, happiness and real genuine care. The rooms are very comfy, beds are like sleeping on feathers, showers really hot.

From their service, their cleanliness, the quality of everything used to run the place, the expansive menu and the wonderful food, it's a challenge to find a flaw.

The rooms are good and the bathrooms are big with excellent facilities (hot running water, very clean bathroom).

It was a great feeling to wake up in morning with birds hopping around and chirping on the trees. The view of the mountains was not direct, but i guess, the more expensive rooms had the right orientation or balcony for the same...
