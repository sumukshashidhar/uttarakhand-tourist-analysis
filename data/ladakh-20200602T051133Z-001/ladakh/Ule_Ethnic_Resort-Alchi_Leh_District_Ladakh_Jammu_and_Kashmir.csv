ladakh,"We stayed in a cottage at the very end of the resort. We were told they were expecting a huge group of tourists, that I didn’t see during may stay, but at least it offered a lovely view of the Indus river. The cottage was clean and well appointed. The room was equipped with all amenities that good, modern hotels in urban areas offer.  Not advisable for people with reduced mobility, because to get to the restaurant it was necessary to climb a steep staircase and many steps, after walking along the path (poorly lit) from your bungalow. This is why I always carry a torch when in India. The other odd thing was that being an eco-friendly resort as they said, they didn’t have wi-fi, BUT the tables were decorated with plastic flowers and plants, besides the horrible drinking PLASTIC",Nalini XS,/Profile/nalinix2017,"Lisbon, Portugal",40

We were alotted a cottage over looking the emerald waters of the Indus with the Kargil-Leh highway alongside it. The room was ideally furnished with all that was  essential and no unnecessary clutter. The bathroom was spacious and clean. The location of the resort is just perfect. The food spread was delicious although only vegetarian (eggs for breakfast are served though) . The passageways around the property are dotted with Apple trees which happened to be in full bloom. The best part is they do not have Wi-Fi as well no TV in rooms. So you'd better explore the outdoors..!!

I even managed to graze my leg after scraping it on the base of the bed.  What really warrants a poor review was the service in the dining room at both lunch, dinner and breakfast.

ladakh,"Would be ideal to stay two nights and do Sham valley sightseeing from here. If it's full they book you in the brother's Uley Eco Resort next door.   The red-roofed cottages are beautifully designed. The tented huts look okay. Beautiful outdoor seating areas for tea or beer. Buffet dinner and breakfast give good variety of choices. Breakfast was outstanding, at least for Western tastes, with fresh bread and the tastiest jam I've had in India: homemade organic jam from the apricots you see all around.  Vegetarian food only, including eggs. Piping hot water in spotless bathrooms, solar heated but hot even in morning. Fluffy duvets and comfy beds in the cottages, just okay in huts. Poor phone reception, only BSNL.   I was there years ago when it was hard to find the management. in",Resident_N0n_Indian,/Profile/Resident_N0n_Indian,"Ladakh, India",50
ladakh,"We had booked (and paid for) our cabins at least six weeks in advance. We had printed confirmations - but when we reached the front desk we were informed that they had no knowledge of us coming & that we'd have to settle for the tents at another property of theirs - further down the road. This was unacceptable to us, and fortunately I have a BSNL cell - which I used to speak to my travel agent as well as the resort's representative. About an hour later, we were able to strong=arm our way into the cabins which were our due. This was an unnecessary oversight & highly unprofessional - especially given the fact that we, the guests in question - were six 'young' ladies (all well into our 40s) But once we settled in - everything was spectacular...... The rooms were clean &",MNBharucha,/Profile/MNBharucha,Pune,40
ladakh,"Stayed in one of the roofed cottages overlooking the Indus River in August 2012. What a fantastic place to have a break from the hectic pace & pollution of Leh - Located off the highway near Alchi & on the way to Lamayaru (from Leh). Well constructed & fitted cottages, good size, ensuite bathroom with solar shower, nice towels & decent toiletries provided - lots of trees, quiet, clean and great views over the Indus, & with the limited light pollution you get to see lots of stars at night! Food was good, & their homemade bread and Apricot Jam were particularly nice.  Well recommended for a one or two night break to re-charge from staying in Leh ..... handy location for visits to Alchi & Lamayaru.",SCS123,/Profile/SCS123,"Manama, Bahrain",40
ladakh,"we had been to this place in May,2012 with our two kids.Tents do not have attached Bathrooms.  But the scenic beauty around, sumptuous food, hospitable staff, reading material in the foyer leaves us with memorable wonderful experience.strongly recommended.",virkar,/Profile/virkar,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Stay in the red-roofed cottages!  (The huts are fine, but do not have private baths as the cottages do. They have other buildings as well; we didn't use those.)  The cottages are very well taken care of, very clean, and exceptionally comfortable --really comfortable, clean bed.  Everyone we encountered who works there was kind, helpful, and friendly.  The management genuinely wanted us to have a good experience; they're attentive.  We did have two wonderful meals (a dinner and breakfast the next day), both of which were fantastic, so they may have worked on that since the last person reviewed Ule.  Quite a variety of food and lots of it -- everything tasted fresh.  They also served tea on the circular stone veranda that overlooks the Indus River.  There's a somewhat steep, short",RacYerbury,/Profile/RacYerbury,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",50
ladakh,"We stayed one night between our visits of Alchi and Lamayuru. The cottage rate is justified by the quality of the room equipment and certainly the bed. Above this you get a wide view on the river and the mountains. I did not appreciate the food, the enthousiast staff could not repair the poor breakfast. Nice quiet location , close to the Leh - Lamayuru road. Probably the best stop on the road to Leh",bbb05,/Profile/bbb05,"Ghent, Belgium",30
ladakh,"We were expecting very little from the cottages and our stay here, and we were pleasantly surprised.  We stayed in one of the private cottages, and were just thrilled.  We have a view of the moutains/river.  We had an attached bathroom, with solar hot water; the shower had great water pressure, and the water was hot.  The food was great, hot, with good service. They packed us lunch for the day we left, and it was just perfect.  My wife and I both had massages, and the staff was professional and gave excellent treatments.  We were both very happy with our stay.  Thank you for making this a great place to visit!",stoneiam,/Profile/stoneiam,"Miami, Florida",50
ladakh,"Firstly, I searched the Tripadvisor site to ensure I write a review for this one, as it was a truly special experience.   Every other reviewer has written about the tented accommodation here, but the highlight of the property are the cottages (about 1-2k more expensive than the tents). We got an impulse tip from travelers in Leh and decided to head over immediately after hearing exemplary reviews from them (well traveled people, like us, with over 4 continents of experience)  The cottages look out to the Indus over a cliff and have windows donning 3 sides of your room. The nights are truly special with a panoramic view of the mountains and night sky.   The staff is extremely pleasant and the food was interesting. They bake their own bread and make their own apricot jams (all",the_0ne,/Profile/the_0ne,"New York City, New York",50
