ladakh,Very nice Family owning guesthouse. Ideal if you want a break in Leh to trek around in Ladakh. Wifi is limited but overall the owners are super friendly and willing to guide and help you. If iâm back in Leh Iâd stay there again.,hal440,/Profile/hal440,"London, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"Kang-La Hotel in Leh is a good budget option located at a walking distance from the main market of Leh. Room that was given to me was just ok. As per the normal guest houses, this was not decorative but very much basic. The owner of the hotel Mr. Salim is very much friendly and helpful. Being localite, he gives you many good suggestions, be it regarding the eating joints or sightseeing places and how to reach those places specially when you are travelling solo... :) Overall, it was a satisfactory stay in this budget hotel.",avdheshghildiyal,/Profile/avdheshghildiyal,"Dehradun, India",30
ladakh,The place is very neat and clean. Service is good and rooms were very tidy. The main advantage of this hotel is the location. It is just 5 mins walk from the main market centre. Hot water was available all through the day. I would recommend this hotel for anyone who don't fuss much about luxury.   I will come back again to this hotel.,Kesavamurthy,/Profile/Kesavamurthy,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,""" Warning! After paying with hostelworld and we stayed was asked for extra money (double the price) .The room was the most dirty found in India and we had bites of some insects.Wi fi and shower are a Dreams.For less money you can find better soluzion.Orrible experience",Pilloide,/Profile/Pilloide,"Turin, Italy",10
ladakh,"I directly arrived from Paris to Leh, and I had taken the first guesthouse that I could have found on the Internet. The place is... Very agreeable. There's a little patio where you can rest while reading a book under the sunlight. The location of this building is very good since its only 5 minutes from the city center. The rooms are Ladakhi style organized, not very comfortable for those who are not used to it, but this is very respectful towards the traditions of the region. And Selim, the manager, really helped me during my stay and was always there when I needed him. He gave me plenty of advice and helped me to organize my two days trek. I will definitely come back to see them again.",wilkes04,/Profile/wilkes04,"Paris, France",50
ladakh,"Salim Bhai the owner is such a helpful, kind and a friendly person who guided you very well . He has great contacts in and around Ladakh. I have been his regular client now past three years : his guesthouse has a homely environment. Clean rooms . Hot water available . I will surely come back again as I  who belong to the coastline feels Leh is my second home in the mountains . ",Enfieldmaniac,/Profile/enfieldmaniac,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"I was here in June 2016, And stayed here for a couple of days.   Day 1 the room was pretty much what I had expected considering what we were paying for it. And we just crashed in.   Had some issues with geyser but the folks provided hot water to the room.  Since we were on the move we stayed here on alternating days with advance booking understanding on payment basis as the rooms twnd to get filled up quick in leh.  Found the guidance from the manager pretty helpful in our explorations and a big thanks to him for that.  On the other hand I woulnd not recommend anyone to rely on the hotel kitchen if you are out mostly.  Carry stuff with you just in case.  Overall if you are looking for a place just to crash after your field trips then this can be a place for you.  ",manish k,/Profile/469manishk,,30
ladakh,"Facilities are average for the price and similar to other guesthouses within the area.  The real issue I had were with the hosts/ staff. I looked to base myself here before a self-supported week-long trek. Throughout my entire stay they would refuse to give me any advice on where to eat, and only suggest their own kitchen - because all other food outside is ""dangerous"" and ""not good for health"". They touted their guided treks numerous times and did not want me to leave without making a booking with one of their guides. This made the stay incredibly unpleasant, so much so that I found another guesthouse to see out my time in Leh.  There is far more welcoming hospitality within the same price range in Leh. I would not recommend this place to anyone.",Greg M,/Profile/868giggles,"Brisbane, Australia",20
ladakh,Rooms are average. Staff Helpful. Foods were so costly as per quantity & quality. Owner of the Hotel Mr Salim was helpful. Location of the hotel is near the central market market place & affectations.  ,Kazi Rashidul Hasan,/Profile/boundule,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",30
ladakh,"The only thing that may sound good about this place is the price(500/day). The manager may seem nice at first which may seem very convincing for the moment. He collected all of the rent in advance and refused any further service after that. We never even got to see him after that. Low on security. Anybody could just walk in. Damp rooms. Which is not what you would like to turn to at the end of the day. Expensive food. Dal and plain rice (200/plate). The only positive thing perhaps would be the cloakroom, in case you wish to go for a long ride lasting days. You will find much nicer hotels just around the corner at an affordable price.",Rashmi R,/Profile/623rashmir,"Ballarat, Australia",10
ladakh,"Manager is a scammer, he tried to lie to us. He told us that environmental fee we paid on the road between manali and leh was a scam, he wanted us to pay that again while making a permit for restricted areas. It turned out there was no problem with the fee we paid and it was deducted form the permit costs. Moreover the hostel is VERY DIRTY, fungus on the walls. No water at the bathroom at all, not even cold one. Wi-Fi was not working. And we paid DEFINITELY too much for such a crappy messy room. THE WORST HOSTEL IN INDIA I HAVE EXPERIENCED.",ChrisandoChris,/Profile/ChrisandoChris,"Braganca, Portugal",10

ladakh,"Not smart, not big, not well appointed but relatively cheap and convenient for most of the amenities of the old town and all the good cafes. Secure storage for bikes was our main concern and this was provided. We found the owner and staff friendly and genuine which made our stay very pleasant. A good option for cash strapped cyclists.",Marcus M,/Profile/marcusm547,,40
ladakh,"The rooms are really dirty, smell cigarettes, the floor is not cleaned, the owner is not honest and lies to the customers. I highly recommend to avoid this place, there are others hostels with a better value for money in Leh.",acrousillac,/Profile/acrousillac,"Lyon, France",10
ladakh,The owner Salim is very warm and friendly. He treated me like I was a guest at his home and not a customer. Salim made sure that I didn't get ripped off and even rectified a situation where I was taken advantage of. The staff was helpful and they would even go out of their way to walk me to different places. Good location. Good deal for the price.,Naved A,/Profile/57naveda,"San Jose, Costa Rica",50

ladakh,"I agree with most of the negative reviews here. The owner gives off the vibe of a person trying to fleece you. The cheapest room(stuffy/one window that overlooks nothing/two single beds/without loo) on the ground floor is not worth more than 50-100 bucks a night -- irrespective of 'season time'. He charges 400-1000/night for that room. Don't buy into whatever the owner has to say about anything. It seems like he tries to make up for the inadequacy of his hotel by making small talk.   He told us all the hotels in town were full during Kalachakra. My friend and I got to Leh on 1st July and it seemed valid as Kalachakra was starting on 3rd July and due to that, it was justified to pay higher than usual rates. I don't mind paying double or triple the amount during 'season' time",manoutheba,/Profile/manoutheba,"Mumbai, India",10

ladakh,"There are lies and there are true lies. We rarely find truly honest people in this world. I don't know who I found here. I am still investigating. There are good and bad things to say but I think more of bad. Travel agency run by Salim Khan is more than expensive and he was successful in cheating me. He once invited me to his relative's house for pink tea and snacks and that was nice, after parking his XUV he told me to help his staff put the cover of the car which I did. The food he provided during a trek was perfect for one to fall sick and unhealthy which I did, thankfully water was carried. Sometimes he and his staff would talk Ladakhi and I wouldn't know if they were speaking behind my back which I'm sure they were. One day he forced me to apply a sunscreen of Saudi Arabia",Himanshu V,/Profile/821himanshuv,"Mumbai, India",10
ladakh,"A small cosy hotel managed by Salim Khan and his family. Stayed with them twice and hotel have options to suit every pocket. Salim bhai also manages treks and tours and gives really helpful suggestions. My maiden trip became successful cos of his support.

ladakh,"Where do I start..  I must admit I was rather shocked when the ""porter"" showed me to my room, but as I was tired after a few days travelling I decided to just take the room, at least for one night in order to get my bearing around town and find something better. I paid 1000 rupees per night for a dirty single room with an even dirtier shared toilet and no breakfast included. There was no lock on the door from the inside of the room (which I at a later stage I pointed out to the manager, who brushed it Nader the carpet) The only good thing was the shared terrace.. Dare I say it didn't weigh up!  It was two days later when I mentioned to the owner or manager named Salim everything got even worse. I politely told him I was checking out. He seemed to believe that I had agreed to",Fredrik H,/Profile/9fredrikh,"Gothenburg, Sweden",10
ladakh,"First of all, the people running this hotel are very nice and friendly and if the room had not been such a mess, we would have liked to stay there. The very small bathroom has obviousliy not been cleaned for some time and there were cigarett stubs and some unidentifiable white slime on the bathroom floor. I have been in India for almost three month now and have seen some really bad bathrooms, but this was one of the worst. The small, dark room had a very bad mold smell and the window was broken, which made it impossible to close it and therefor not to hear the generator all night long. Taking into account that they demanded 600 Rupies for that room, our stay there was a big rip off. I must also say, that they were pretty full at the time of our arrival and that this room must",Felix D,/Profile/FelixD802,"Berchtesgaden, Germany",20
ladakh,"July 2012: After the obligatory journey by bus from Manali to Leh we were exhausted and did not have booked accomodation yet. According to a recommendation from an other traveller we went to Kang-La hotel. Salim and his family were very friendly from the first instant and gave us a room although they were obviously pretty full. The room and the whole house was very small with steep and narrow stairs...but therefor also very typical ladkhi. Our first room was really small, dark and I even had some claustrophobical feelings at night. Fortunately we could change the next morning to an other room, which was brighter and also a littel big bigger. The beds were really hard in every room.

Also a nice flow of international travelers to hang out with. wifi if needed, as best as you can hope for in Leh. Nice staff and very decent price.  Attatched trecking and adventure travel agency.  The room was clean and hot water was constant, thought pressure was low. Great location, with Fort Rd and main bizarr 3 minutes away.",zabari,/Profile/zabari,Leh,50
ladakh,"I met the owner of the hotel at the aiport itself and he offered me to drive his jeep to hotel without even knowiong my driving skills. I declined, knowing my driving skills well :) As soon as I got to the hotel, I got a lovely Ladakhi tea as a welcome drink - a nice cinnamon flavored tea which is the perfect compliment to the weather and scenery around. The hotel has a beautiful reading rooms and a ncie terrace which are awesome for me to sit down and indulge in my books. The rooms are cosy and well priced and most importantly, the people are the friendliest I have met during my numerous tours making this an experience I will well remember.

When you are minimum 1000KM away from your home & are in totally new terrain.. you always look forward to meeting such people with whom you feel homely & seek their suggestions on personal basis.
