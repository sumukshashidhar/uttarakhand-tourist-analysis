ladakh,Located about 5-10 minutes from shop central. Like all places to stay in Leh i believe no heat. Bed was a little hard which seems to be norm in Leh also. Hot water with not the best wifi. Food we got was really good.,Todd L,/Profile/257ToddL,"Littleton, Colorado",50
ladakh,"We stayed in the summer of 2017 as a group of people, having the guesthouse as a base in-between trips to different locations. We could leave our luggage there and was well taken care of. The hosts were extremely friendly. I stayed in the rooms in the new building which are extremely spacious, with large windows, very clean. We felt very comfortable there. You can have breakfast outside, they have a nice garden. I really loved the place and I would definitely go back there again",Iulia8,/Profile/Iulia8,"Stavanger, Norway",50
ladakh,"The rooms are very spacious with beautiful view (in pics from the room I stayed). One will enjoy the variety of food served here, I enjoyed the ladakhi roti, khichdi & organic veggies the most. They also have a good collection of books to flip through incase you wish to relax in the guest house. It has very good parking space that accommodates cars + bikes together. In addition has 24*7 hot water available. The guest house within the premises also provides budget rooms ( with common bathroom space). It's closer to the market and Shanti stupa is also visible. This was the best accommodate that we stayed while our stay in leh and is complete value for money. The owner and her help are extremely industrious, caring, helpful & fun loving making you at absolute ease.",Yuvika D,/Profile/yuvikad2016,,50

ladakh,"This guesthouse is really worth it. We loved are stay here. Close to center but away from all the noise. Perfect to get used to the altitude. Lovely staff and garden. They do everything to make you comfortable. When you enter the room it really smells good, not as in the rest of india. Clean bathroom. We had several rooms because of not booking beforehand and leaving for some trips but they were all super nice. You could leave your bagage while on a trekking. Beautiful views and peacefull garden.  Posibility to do your own clothwashes.... There is free filtered water available. Wifi isnt great but that is in all leh.",Mieke G,/Profile/7miekeg,,50
ladakh,"Solpong is a family guest house situated in the upper Changspa road. I arrived at Solpon having developed Acute mountain sickness (AMS) but the owner - Tsewang ensured I was taken care of. I stayed there for 6 days and could not have asked for a better place.  Rooms were spacious, clean with comfortable and warm beds. Attached washrooms which were equally spacious, had 24*7 hot water and were well maintained. Aunty, as we used to address the owner, was the most friendly lady you could have ever met. She obliged to our request for Ladakhi cuisine and cooked Chu-tai for one of the meals. Rest of the times, Karan (the chef at the guest house) served delicious food as per order. Wi-fi was sporadic but I am not complaining. You can spend your time sipping tea and gazing at the",kumars03,/Profile/kumars03,"Pune, India",50
ladakh,"Arguably the best available guesthouse that offers hotel-grade services. It is complete with traditional Ladakhi kitchen, appealing rooms and a little 'farm' of its own.  The rooms of the older rooms are said to be better. Do ask for rooms with better wifi coverage. It is usually packed with foreign tourists who tend to stay for weeks over here so do book in advance. There is also a room with 2 double bed. It is 15 minutes walk from the main bazar",Arihant J,/Profile/ArihantJ78,,50
ladakh,"When my time ran out at another hotel, I was confused with the amount of accommodation and pricing levels in the small bustling town of Leh. My mind was put at  ease immediately as soon as I walked through the gate of this guest house. It was very quiet yet close walking distance to the shops and restaurants of Changspa Rd. The rooms are very clean, this secluded guest house is very hard to refuse.",John F,/Profile/JohnF256,"Melbourne, Australia",50
ladakh,"Good people, clean place and peaceful environment. I travel solo few years back on October month. The room was specious and people were very nice and friendly. The view form the room were amazing. Love this place. Thanks.",Konwar,/Profile/Konwar,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"We had a very enjoyable stay at solpon guest house, felt immediately as home. Rooms are spotless and hotel standard, very good value for the price. It's a bit off from the city centre, although we walked it quite often, even at night (just bring a pocket light), but some good restaurants and cafés are close by. Owner itself is superb, most friendly lady. Even when my girlfriend was sick she was a great support. Would stay there again right away. ",Manaslu_V,/Profile/Manaslu_V,"Laakdal, Belgium",50
ladakh,"It is a good, clean place worth the value for money. Rooms are well maintained and clean. It is the only guest house in that locality that had its own attached washrooms ( not shared / common wash rooms ). A bit off the road from the market place but that is a plus point as it adds up to the cool and composed aura of this place. The fact that they use 100% home grown vegetables for cooking food is definitive plus. The house garden is a beauty in itself and the view from the reception is amazing. The owners are very courteous and warm.",Nishan K,/Profile/716nishank,,50
ladakh,"Solpon is a family guest house. Perfectly located in the most wonderful part of Leh. Close from commodities but far enough from the fuss. There are two buildings and an incredible garden. Rooms are really clean, there's always hot water, beds are very comfortable. And above all, it's held by an adorable and helpful family. It's a great place to stay and to meet travelers.

ladakh,"The place, upper Chnagspa is bit far from the main town. But that is the catch. The place is quite and serene. One can spend the whole day at the hotel or at lawn just enjoying the view and the weather. The owner is very generous and friendly. Good thing is the have a free wifi(which does not work most of the time, :P).  only con is that it is pretty far from the town. So everytime, to take a cab or to have the meal, you have to walk down to the market. Also they do not offer any meals.",Arghajit,/Profile/a_typical_bong,"Hyderabad, India",50
ladakh,"We just got back from Ladakh, and I still can't get over this place. The rooms are warm and beautiful with a very nice view although the wifi didn't work in the room that was okay with us. The owner, Tswang was very kind and generous. She's a very nice lady. If I ever visit ladakh again, I know where to stay.",Dina S,/Profile/801dinas,,50
ladakh,"Solpon Guest House has all that I could wish for: Quiet location in upper Changspa surrounded by farm & trees with the best view from my window, but just a 5 minute walk to stores & restaurants- Comfort and spick & span clean with all amenities- Spacious and beautiful room- Free & good wifi- Hot water showers (solar with backup wood stove to heat the water)- 24 hours electricity- Fresh home cooked food on request- Filtered water refills- Owned & run by a kind and efficient Ladakhi family- Dolma and Angmo were always there to assist. I stayed in the new building- Not expensive for the best quality rooms. They also have spacious rooms with shared bath in the older building. They have cows & a vegetable garden.

ladakh,"This Homestay is run by a lady Tswang with her family. One of the most generous, helpful, courteous woman I ever met. We stayed here for almost a week during our visit to Leh in July '13. We were initially looking for a B&B in market area but it was full and we were glad that we got this option which was far better that any B&B / Hotel in market place. The property is located little away from market but provides excellent view of Leh. Rooms are clean and well maintained. The dining room provides feeling of ancient Maharaja. :) If you don't like a menu for dinner, not to worry. The lady Tswang will get your favourite dish cooked on demand. A must stay place in Leh during your visit.",GDARSHANG,/Profile/GDARSHANG,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"We stayed here on and off during our trip to Leh as we left for various trips, returning to Solpon (when there were availabilities). The rooms in the new building are very airy, bright and spacious.  The location very quiet, with beautiful views.  I rate this as Excellent, even though in my opinion, it lacks a central area where travellers can mingle (which I found very helpful in other guesthouses in which we stayed).  However, this is an excellent option.",TravelingMoshavnik,/Profile/TravelingMoshavnik,"Beit Yitzhak-Sha'ar Hefer, Israel",50
ladakh,I had a comfortable and pleasant stay in this place. the lady of the house is a great and a generous soul. the staff is excellent. they are sweet and honest people. the stay is as good as a big hotel but it is light on your pocket. i would strongly recommend it.,4_is_a_company,/Profile/4_is_a_company,"Amritsar, India",50

ladakh,"Yep, I've put it simple: this is (arguably, of course :) the best place you could find in Leh for an extremely reasonable price. 4 planned days to stay easily turned into 10: first, as you enter, you find yourself in a very clean and new hotel (the owners insist on calling it ""guesthouse"") with all the facilities required, second - Tswang is most amazing woman that turns your stay into pure pleasure, third - the home breakfast should not be missed under any circumstances: chai from a freshest milk ever (they have a cow) with traditional Ladakhi bread straight from the oven and other ingredients that will sweeten your memories long after leaving Leh, fourth - the hotel is only ~10 minutes walk away from the city and your sleep will be calm and quiet, fifth - if you'll leave your",Sasha,/Profile/sasha_photo_music,"Tel Aviv, Israel",50

The guest house is surrounded by a nice garden with flowers and greens, fields, trees and a small road on the westside with only very few traffic. The rooms (bathrooms also) are large, clean and bright. It´s a place with wonderful view to the mountains in all directions, to Stok Kanghri  as well as to Tsemo Gonpa.
