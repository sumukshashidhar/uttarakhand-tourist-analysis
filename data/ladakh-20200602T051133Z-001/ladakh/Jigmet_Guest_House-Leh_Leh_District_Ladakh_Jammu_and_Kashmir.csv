Average rooms and facilities. 3. Am sure there are better places nearby.  Surely a one time visit.Jigmet can be avoided really.,gautamlunawat,/Profile/gautamlunawat,,20
ladakh,"Our room was on the second floor (121). It was spacious, clean, warm and had a nice view. Mr. Jigmet is a wonderful person, helpful, always smiling, takes care of the gusts and runs the place with a great team of staff. Would like to mention Mr. Anand, Md, Shahbaz and others for their services. Food is excellent and they would make sure to offer the best even with limited resources (we reached at a time when the trucks from Srinagar with supplies have just arrived). 10/10, will surely visit again.",peacemusafir,/Profile/peacemusafir,Delhi,50
ladakh,I was here with a group of friends and their family. All 13 of us had a fantastic stay here with Mr Jigmet himself there who is a really warm host. Hospitality and the breakfast that we had there was unmatched. The staff was very courteous and we did have minor glitches but the hotel staff was kind enough to address every concern we had. Worth staying there is you are on a mediocre budget and looking for an excellent place to rest before you spread to any region of Ladakh this is the place to be.

We were delighted to discover that the hotel is family owned and run, and loved the garden, which is the result of much hard work by Jigmet's parents.

Ladakh is a really noisy place: lots of tooting vehicles and barking dogs. So it's important to have a quiet place to rest and relax after hiking or visiting monasteries. This hotel has a large lovely garden where you can have breakfast or a snack and because it's not on a busy street, it is quiet. The bed is firm and comfortable. I slept very well.

But we got the warmth and friendliness from this family since first step we visited, which not only the comfortable and clean room-amenities. They advised us how to live and arrange trip that not too hard for our health, and kindly allowed us leave the belongings at their place while we switched to travel to other towns.  Furthermore It's such a good location because not far from market, stores and restaurants that we could reach there within 10 minutes.  Jigmet Guest House and Hotel have a great surroundings, we could see the range from our room balcony and the unexpectedly items are the hot water system and wi-fi internet are available.",khonnohk,/Profile/khonnohk,"Bangkok, Thailand",50
ladakh,Excellent value for the money. Hospitality and helpfullness were beyond reproach. Was great to have breakfast in the sunshine in the garden. The garden always provided a peaceful place to return to in the afternoon.  Although hot water was not always available one got used to the routine. Highly recommended for long term visit.,gypsyatsea,/Profile/gypsyatsea,"Victoria, Canada",40

ladakh,"We stayed at Jigmet's guest house in May 2011. While we reached there, a day ahead of schedule, and Jigmet's guest house was being renovated, he and his family was very prompt to make arrangements and accomodate.  The guest house is nice and spacious, but it seems larger because of how much Jigmet & his family accomodates. He was prompt in keeping us posted about the IPL tournament knowing we had no access to TVs on the move, he helped us plan travel around Leh.  My friends and i will remember the dinner at his kitchen, with his family... this was truly home away from home.",Prashanth S,/Profile/prashanths05,"Bengaluru, India",50

ladakh,"It's great ,Jigmet  GOD BLESS YOU  A young and dynamic person JIGMET is working hard for guests, it's mind blowing experience we have ever feel in our life. We were three families with 6 children , purely vegetarians , it's difficult to find veg. food in a place like LEH but here was a fellow called Jigmet in our help and provide everything that our children want. Surprisingly the every family member of  Jigmet are in service of guests. Jigmet's parents, his lovely wife and sisters are all became our friend, It's simply a home away home........  We enjoyed lot here for four days. If you go Leh and want to stay there then there is no place other than the Jigmet guest house.",Savdas_40,/Profile/Savdas_40,"Nadiad, India",50

ladakh,"Although highly rated by Lonely Planet, our stay at the Jigmet Guest House in Leh was very unsatisfactory.  Our room was spacious and the garden setting was delightful, however the whole experience fell over when it came to hot water. To provide hot water for showers the owners needed to fuel and light a boiler, something which they seemed to have a major problem with. Despite numerous complaints from various members of our group hot water was available only once a day and if you didn't time it right you simply missed out. In three days I had one hot shower, my partner had none.  A lesser point is that there were no rubbish bins in the rooms. Rubbish was placed in a bin on the verandah, however in three days the bin, altough overlflowing,  was never emptied.  Lovely setting but",aadaca,/Profile/aadaca,Perth,20
