ladakh,"This hotel is a small gem run by Mr. Norboo Gailchan. This small hotel is just perfect! It has wonderful staff, comfortable rooms, beautiful views, good food and wifi that works well despite Ladakh's rather limited internet connectivity. Excellent small hotel and very well worth a stay if you're in Alchi area of Ladakh! Kudos to the hotel staff for their great service!",Jeffrey A,/Profile/189jeffreya,"Houston, Texas",50
ladakh,"The new wing of the hotel, where we stayed, is called Hotel Alchi Zimskhang. Old wing is still existing, but does not seem to be in use. New wing has fascinating woodwork - on furniture as well as on doors and windows - providing you a glimpse of local heritage. Clean and large rooms are comfortable even when you have an extra bed laid out. Good selection of vegetarian food on breakfast and dinner buffet. Staff is polite, well versed with English language. Hotel is right next to a monastery that is more than 100 years old.",Mrugesh B,/Profile/MrugeshB_2,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"The Zimskhang holiday home is located in a very quaint little Himalayan valley town with one of the oldest monastery. The Alchi town offers opportunities to spend quiet , relaxing time.   Taking impromptu walks into the small village , one get to meet the local families working lovingly in their fields during the summer. One of the family invited to see their truly organic farm and also have a cup of tea in their 70 year old ancestral home.   The zimskhang holiday home is personally managed by the friendly owner Mr Noorboo. The property is clean , the staff is friendly.   I recommend this as a must exploring Ladakh , wanting to experience Himalayan india and also Buddhist culture explorers. ",FrenchHaveli,/Profile/FrenchHaveli,"Jaipur, India",50

ladakh,"We didn't stay at this hotel but we stopped for lunch. It's located just next to the monastery and they have tables in a nice garden. Food was really excellent, a very nice lunch break while doing a tour to Lamayuru.",Peter J,/Profile/PeterJ9011,"Helsinki, Finland",40
ladakh,"I had visited several places at Alchi. But I think Zimkhang is the best place to stay at Alchi. Very neat and clean. Staffs are well behaved and dressed. Room , Lobby, Restaurant every thing is perfect. Food is awesome. ",Achint Sinha,/Profile/achintsinha,India,50
ladakh,"We visited this place at 9 pm on 8th Jul 2018. It is a very good property. Dinner was served from 9 pm to 10 pm. Food was very good. Staff is very helpful. Good Rooms with balcony and clean bathrooms. Hot water was 24/7. Location is superb and very close to Alchi Monastery. On the way to Alchi monastery, u can shop all Tibetian stuff. Behind the hotel, there is the Indus valley view. The owner of this hotel is very helpful and humble person. Morning Breakfast we had a good spread. They served you on the table. Overall wonderful experience. Loved this place",Vatsala15,/Profile/Vatsala15,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",50
ladakh,Nice small hotel with more  or less all facilities. Food is good and tasty. Staff is friendly and helpful. Its got a nice restaurant although the variety of food is limited due to non-availability of vegetables. Rooms are neat and well maintained with large clean bathrooms. Pleasant surprise was availability of hot water in the taps.,Goutam D,/Profile/goutamd557,,40
ladakh,"We stayed one night here and found the hotel very good. A quaint old styled place with an excellent restaurant that served very good Indian food. Also, this was one of the few places in Ladakh where the wifi worked superbly in the room as well as in the lobby of the hotel. The location is superb in terms of proximity to the famous Alchi Monastery. It is just a 5 to 10 minute walk. Also, along this walk and outside the hotel you will find lots of vendors and artisans selling local Ladakhi stuff.",zubinb3,/Profile/zubinb3,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"I have visited this place last year, and it was an awesome stay in Zimskhang Holiday Home. Location is superb and very close to Alchi monastery. Clean and well decorated rooms with all amenities. Food was nice. Overall great experience.",somsen,/Profile/somsen,"Kolkata, India",40
ladakh,"The staff aren't very friendly. The rooms are OK. We found a lizard in one and had to get our room shifted. On the first day the staff didn't serve us the full breakfast. They don't have facilities for the driver as well. Usually most hotels in Ladakh provide a room for the driver and some basic refreshments, this place outright rejected the drivers stay and he had to spend the night in his car.",deecee02,/Profile/deecee02,"Bengaluru, India",20
ladakh,Nice property with a fantastic food and location. Just walking distance from famous Alchi monastery 10th century. The staff is so helpful and they guide us so properly about Ladakh routes. They have very tree of walnuts and apricots in there hotel compounds. We had some of it specially little apple was a awesome.,jaspalsingh7,/Profile/jaspalsingh7,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,"Stayed a night here. Nice, comfortable room. Lots of sunshine during the day. The surrounding area is not that great though. We stayed at the top floor and still didn't have any views of the mountains. Our windows opened to an unkempt part of the garden with booze bottles thrown everywhere. Naturally, we kept our windows closed.  Restaurant has a nice enough setting but food isn't that great. Service was satisfactory.  Wifi does not work. Hot water was no problem.",AnuradhaGhose,/Profile/AnuradhaGhose,"Calcutta, West Bengal, India",30
ladakh,"I satyed for one day at Zimskhang Holiday resort in Alchi. Hotel is at 5 minutes walking distance away  from Alchi monaster.  Their restaurant was the best. Had a great dinner there. Delicious food. Everone in my family appreciated the food. Rooms were spacious, clean and very comfortable. Rooms had water boiler, milk cream and tea bags as well. Room service were on time. I asked for coffee at 6am and coffee was there right at 6 am.  I recommend Alchi for a night stay for all those who are travelling from srinagar to leh. ",Thanigaivel M,/Profile/thanigaivelm,,50
ladakh,"The hotel was nestled in the Alchi village. Do not expect too much in the way of amenities, rooms were basic. Food was good. I did not think it justified the price. I visited this hotel on the way from Kargil to Leh earlier in July this year",ankitiitd,/Profile/ankitiitd,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",30
ladakh,"It was a bit ""Fawlty Towers"" at times, but I really liked this place! On the plus side: - Traditional Tibetan-style architecture with a front porch and seating in a pleasant garden; large open air lobby seating area on first floor; large rooms with windows that opened to the wonderful fresh air; curtains that closed fully; good lighting; comfortable beds and pillows; lots of hot water; bath slippers provided to prevent slipping on marble flooring; quiet area; dining across the road both indoor and out; excellent food with ample portions On the negative side: no shower curtain so everything in the bathroom gets wet; door locking arrangement doesn't work well! (Staff who couldn't open my door had to send to town for a saw to cut the padlock off!!)

ladakh,"Zimskhang hotel is situated at a walking distance from Alchi monastery and is run by Mr Norboo.   The rooms are clean and well maintained, the blankets are very warm n makes you wanna laze around. Hot water is available in d morning n evening (not sure with the timings), but it was just lukewarm.     The hotel has its restaurant which caters to yummy food. On the day v reached v found d gravies served for lunch to be on the sweeter side. My family being lover of pungent food requested Mr Norboo to ensure our dinner be a little spicy and voila our dinner was just as we expected. So all i'm trying to say is Mr Norboo is very open for suggestions and criticism and he'll try his best to keep his guest happy.      Would recommend this place for a pleasant stay.",Suma28,/Profile/Suma28,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,Had to pay for water even though we had an all inclusive package. Staff at reception very rude and didn't give us any information on meal times etc. Didn't even get a welcome hello or smile. Would never stay here again.,KimH_Australia,/Profile/KimH_Australia,,10
ladakh,"Did not stay at the Holiday home, but used their fine restaurant. After a long afternoon at the Alchi Monastery - with 2 kids, we stumbled upon this little gem.  This place has clean western toilets, a setting amongst beautiful mature garden, very hospitable staff and  good food that is reasonably priced.",Mukhers,/Profile/Mukhers,"Windsor and Maidenhead, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"About 160 km (4 hour drive) from Kargil and 60 km (less than 2 hours) from Leh. Zimskhang is located in Alchi. Alchi is about 1,000 feet lower than Leh and thus a recommended stop before going on to Leh if driving from Srinagar. Alchi is about 4 kms from the highway across the Indus. For a major part of the 4 km (10 minute) drive, one sees little habitation. Drive right on to crowded Alchi (the streets are narrow and the houese/buildings are bunched together) and one will find Zimskhang right in the heart of the village. Alchi Monastery is a short walk from Zimskhang and the Indus is visible from one end of the Monastery complex.  The rooms and furnishings are neat and clean. The restaurant (recommend) is on a separate compound right opposite, with an option of open air dining.",ptrav9,/Profile/ptrav9,,40
ladakh,Had lunch in the restaurant - Great food - superb buffet of indian and oriental foods plus the banana custard with a hot drink - all for 350 Rps. No wonder it is busy - book in advance to guarantee your place. Service was good too.,Rickardo1961,/Profile/Rickardo1961,"London, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"Lovely hotel in a lovely tranquil place. We stayed there two nights whilst in Ladakh. Rooms were clean, beds comfortable and water was hot. The hotel provided breakfast and dinner and was the best food throughout our trip. Staff were very friendly.  Would recommend without hesitation.",Pat W,/Profile/patw442,"Warwick, United Kingdom",40
ladakh,Outstanding place. We stayed for one night. The room was excellent with nice bathroom and 24 hours hot water. Excellent staff. Good service and brilliant food. Tasty breakfast. The location is amazing. Between tranquility and peace. Amazing experience would surely recommend. ,HP02,/Profile/HP02,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,We stayed here for one night on a 10 day trip around Ladakh. The restaurant had the best food we had in our entire trip. They have a very good variety and the staff are really friendly.

ladakh,"This was  a clean welcoming holiday home.  We had been travelling for 7 hours to get here and a cold beer on arrival was both unexpected and very welcoming.  The rooms were clean, the staff friendly and helpful.  The situation is ideal with incredible.  The food was served across the courtyard outdoors and was both tasty and plentiful.  I would have no hesitation in recommending this as a place to stay.",Lyn W,/Profile/288lynw,"Swansea, United Kingdom",40
ladakh,We went to Alchi in Oct 2011 and stayed at Zimskhang Hotel for one day. The hotel is located very close to the Alchi Monastery with picturesque  and peaceful surroundings. The room was very nice and clean with all the necessary amenities. The hotel staff was great with extremely efficient service. The food was very good as well. We had booked the room inclusive of meals via internet and while checking out the hotel manager gave us off-season discount of 20% on the original confirmed price.This honesty is characteristics of Ladakhi people in general.   I would recommend the hotel to everybody planning to visit this beautiful place.,sandyril,/Profile/sandyril,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"We stayed for a single night but would happily have spent more time in this wonderful place. We enjoyed a spotlessly clean room with a lovely view and attached bathroom with the most awesome hot water shower. The hotel is surrounded by a lovely flower-filled garden, good shopping nearby and just steps away from the magnificent temple complex you'll go to Alchi to see. The restaurant is situated just across the lane from the hotel in a lovely garden setting. Delicious meals with great service. I give this place all thumbs up!",BobB3,/Profile/BobB3,"Rome, Italy",50
ladakh,"Located in the lush vegetations next to the river, the restaurant is on one side of the walking path to the ancient Temple, and the hotel rooms in a separate building on the other side. The food was the best we had on our trip, all dishes very tasty, and every meal different. Nice location to sit outside. The rooms were on two floors, with terraces and a garden around. Rooms were clean, nice big showers, and warm water. Highly recommended.",Bhutantraveller,/Profile/Bhutantraveller,"Amsterdam, Holland",50
ladakh,"It was a pleasant surprise, a resort well placed in the midst of nature, this resort has everything that can blow you off your feet. Very hospitable staff with excellent rooms and services offered. Food was equally awesome. I wished for a longer stay at this lovely resort.  Will wish all the best and thanks to the staff at Zimskhang Holiday Home, you guys are doing great!",Chirag M,/Profile/ChiragM420,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Alchi is a small place, but even then the location of Zimskhang is very good, paces away from the famous monastery  The room was nice, clean & big & the bathroom almost equally big. Facilities are basic but well maintained. There's frequent power outage in this area (& indeed the whole of Ladakh), so keep a torch handy  The owner is nice & helpful. I had requested his help to find good photography locations around Alchi & he let his brother guide me through the lanes & paths of the village to a couple of fine places. I wouldn't have ever found out these locations on my own, even though I consider myself an explorer :-)",Angshu,/Profile/Angshu,"Mumbai, India",50
