ladakh,"Great hospitality, Clean and new room, Very good location!! Owner family and staff are all nice and helpful. Perfect location!! Roof top view was so amazing!!!!!!! you can see the great Himalaya mountain view!!!!!! I would love to come back to this guesthouse again next time!! xxx  改装したての新しいお部屋に泊まりました。内装はとても新しく綺麗で、特にシャワーの水圧はインドとは思えないほど素晴らしく感動して泣きそうになりました。（でも時間帯によってはお湯が出ない時もありました）3人で泊まったのですが、エクストラベッドをお願いしたら快く用意してくれて、スタッフの方やオーナーファミリーはとても親切で感じが良かったです。ちょうどラダック祭りの時期に泊まったのですが、お祭りのパンフレットをくれたり、おすすめを教えてくれたり、チャイを入れてくれたり、本当に親切でした。お部屋によって、古いお部屋と改装したてのお部屋で差がありそうですが、改装したてのお部屋は感動するくらい綺麗なので、是非お勧めです！そして屋上の景色はヒマラヤのパノラマ一望できます！洗濯物もたくさん干せます。最後に、やはりなんといっても立地が良いです。便利な立地です。全体的におススメです＼(^o^)／",Yuka,,,50
ladakh,"For the price, Skitpo was a decent place to stay. Had decent amenities and bathroom was clean (which is my biggest issue in cheap places). Staff is good, especially owner. Location is good as well, quite centrally located. Don't expect fanciness like Grand Dragon as it is not costly.",Ayushi Chandra,,,40

ladakh,"Reached leh after a gruelling two day drive from Manali. Skitpo guest house was suggested by a good friend. Managed by a very warm hearted family who are old residents of leh. Felt save, comfortable and had a great holiday. Good service and great honest advise about leh. Saves a tourist a lot of time. Mr. And Mrs. Iqbal, tanveer and Asif and yusuf really made our stay comfortable.",Karim Currimbhoy,,,50
ladakh,"very nice place to stay.....we have stayed there for one month and few days, centrally located the people at guest house are very good and friendly and have enough information for tourist about leh and around.They also arrange all kind of tour in and around leh & ladakh. p.s. Good WIFI",glebkatakov,,"Sochi, Russia",50
ladakh,"I stayed there for four days. At our arrival the bathroom was very unclean and we asked politely to clean it. The mother didn't want to do it and told us to leave the place. The son arrived and cleaned slightly (only the floor, the lavatory and mirror were white with tooth paste and dirt) Although the bathroom has a shower, don't  get confused. It does not work at all. And concerning hot water, forget it!  The solution was a bucket they bring from their room, which obviously did have hot water!!!! They didn't clean the place in 4 days, after that we left and went to another place, they looked very disappointed and didn't understand why we were leaving... We told them that the place was dirty and the only answer we got was ""oh, yes, yes, yes""",Jime V,/Profile/222jimev,"Santiago, Chile",20
ladakh,"I stayed here for seven nights in total. I kept coming back after excursions. It felt like coming home because of the hospitality of the family. The guesthouse is very well located, near the main square. I would absolutely come back. The uper rooms are really nice. ",Iris G,/Profile/341irisg,,50
ladakh,"Stayed here for a week and was very happy with the hospitality of the family running it. Asif is one of the managers and is super helpful. I stayed in three separate rooms on the second floor and they were comfortable and clean. Do note that the hot water supply is better in the rooms on the left side, which face the lane. The only issue is that there is no restaurant or breakfast served, but then there are plenty of restaurants just around the corner.",Hippie Vibes,/Profile/hippievibes,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"Stayed here for two days. Comfortable rooms, clean toilets, amazing staff that will help you in knowing Leh better. They help in arranging tours and treks around. Hot water service available. Beautiful view from terrace.",Dhiraj J,/Profile/DhirajJ80,,50
ladakh,"I stumbled across this place while walking around the downtown area looking for a hotel. I don't know if they can take bookings online, but I asked the young man to show me a sample room. For 500 per night for a single guest with a separate bathroom, it was great.  Room was clean, and nobody else on the fsame level, so I had the toilet to myself. Shower was hot, and bed sheets and bedroom simple but clean. I would come again if I could. Within walking distance to shops, restaurants, and travel agents. Can't beat the price value!",Nathalie7077,/Profile/Nathalie7077,"Ontario, Canada",50
ladakh,Located a 5 minute walk away from the market.  Free wifi too which is super fast! No room service. Limited option for food. Ample space for parking availaible. Interior of room was pleasant. Overall worth the money paid,studiouscp,/Profile/studiouscp,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"Stayed here for 3 days! Short stay comfy stay! Rooms are quite clean & decent. Affordable option. Free wifi too which is super fast! Parking also available for bikes! Room service for food, was not very appealing as not many options for food!",AkashRoonwal,/Profile/AkashRoonwal,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,"Located a 5 minute walk away from the market, Skitpo is great if you don't expect much from a hotel outside of a place to come back to and sleep. There is no service to speak of and there isn't much cleaning done in the room during your stay either.  Hot water is a bit of an issue too since this area is prone to power cuts and for some reason, every time the power went, hot water went with it too (which is odd considering there are solar heaters here). Wi-fi was apparently down in the valley at the time we were there  Rooms are cozy with some of them getting sunlight in the morning making the room comfortable. Great views all around though",goodnight2die,/Profile/goodnight2die,"Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,"The (very pleasant) mother of the manager complained to me 'why we only charge 400 and all other hotel 900, 1000, you get very good deal!'.  Well, you could start by putting some effort into running your hotel, preferably by cleaning the bathroom and sheets between guests. The dirt was almost funny, a simple wipe of the tiles in the bathroom is hardly likely to break your sons back.  As with a lot of lower end hotels in India, it's taken as a given by the owner that there will be a steady stream of desperate tourists that are willing to exchange minimum rupee for minimum quality and effort. Sadly for the owners, I think those days are coming to an end as the hostel market takes off.  This place is super basic but far nicer than the dump recommended in the LP next door.",tomosaurus,/Profile/tomosaurus,London,20
ladakh,"a great place to stay if you want to be a 5 minutes walking distance from  main market.The hosts are kind and generous and most likely to call you over for a meal !!all arrangements including cars managed by hosts, off course on request.

ladakh,"Guest house is near to main market and people at guest are very good, the rooms are good and clean. I will suggest my friends to visit this place and I will also visit next year with my girlfriend.The person who looks after the guest house is very helpful.",169sky,/Profile/169sky,"Leh, India",50
