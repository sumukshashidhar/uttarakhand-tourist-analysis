ladakh,"During trip to nubra vally of cox& kngs stayed in this palce, ok place for 1 night not so much food options but man you have to be resonable when you come to know that food comes from leh in tourist vehicles to this place. ok for stay, the valley itself is very different than what we normally see, India has too much diversity to visit around, not well marketed.",anaxbio1,/Profile/anaxbio1,"Rajahmundry, India",30
ladakh,"great stay, courteous staff along with great location, it is closed for 6 months due to snowfall, so inquire & book. At least two night stay recommended as lot of activities around the hotel. The food is great, mumbaikars would love the taste",unique186,/Profile/unique186,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,The real sense of living in the desert surrounded by snow clad mountains..truthfully never felt before. Nubra valley is a beautiful place and a must visit once a lifetime. It was a great experience especially with such a great hotel experience. Simple rooms & great service.,DarshilJhaveri,/Profile/DarshilJhaveri,"Mumbai, India",40
