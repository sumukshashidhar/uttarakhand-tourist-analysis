I booked one room for two with shared toilet but owner of guest house was so kind he offered me separate room attaches toilet.and also provided one extra KAMBAL as it was bit winter there. Cost wise it's very cheap and affordable... Two caretakers of guest house (one of them is Aziz) were very helpful and supporting. Every evening used to walk through market .

ladakh,"In September 2018, we were on an extended vacation in Ladakh, which involved local touring in Leh as well as extended car trips to other parts of Ladakh and finally a 9-day trek in the Markha Valley.  Our original reservation was for the Niri-la GH and we spent the first three nights there.  Coming from sea level, Bangkok, we both had headaches and we were pleased that we could order food in, delivered to our room, from a local restaurant.  The food was quite good and we were relieved to not have to go out.  After our first stay at this beautiful guest house, we opted to return twice after our 2nd and 3rd forays in Ladakh.  The guest house dutifully and safely stored our gear.    The rooms in the guest house are new; being about one year old and are very comfortably appointed.

ladakh,"Booked it for 2 nights in May 2018. Slightly away from the mail city but walk-able. The hotel is more of a home stay with the owner occupying the bigger building and they have also added an annexe building with additional rooms. wonderful views of shanti stupa from the rooftop and even form some rooms. The rooms are big, clean and well furnished. The family grows basic vegetables in the compound which gives it a nice family vibe.  They provide basic breakfast. for lunch and dinner choices food can be ordered from outside restaurants. On the flipside, while the area is a peaceful area, the noise from corridor can be bothersome in the rooms.

ladakh,"I stayed at Niri-la Ladakh Guest House for a week. The room is fine, and the hot water in the bathroom actually works. Like many guesthouses, it has a little garden and you can sit outside for breakfast. It's only a 5-10 min walk to the main market, and very calm because it's at the end of the street. The family who runs it is very nice and helpful. They organized a monastery trip car for one day and a trip to Nubra Valley with other travellers who stayed at the guest house. That made it even more easy to travel than it already is in Leh! Getting my permit however was a bit annoying, because the landlady didn't press the office to check my passport (they saw my old visa had expired and didn't bother to flip the next page to the the current, valid one), so I had to postpone one",miriamsson,/Profile/miriamsson,"Munich, Germany",40

The family were remarkably kind and helpful during this time, offering to cook us dinner (not ordinarily available) of rice and vegetables for our stomachs to tolerate, plus extra blankets and hot water bottles for the night. The gardens are exquisite and there's so much peace and quiet here you'll forget all about the madness of Delhi! Some negative points however - the beds were horrendously hard and so perhaps some foam mattress toppers could resolve that, plus some extra pillows.

The room was spacious with a clean bathroom and plenty of hot water. The balcony is nice and overlooks the main garden of the hotel.  The staff were polite and friendly. The breakfast, comprising an omelet, fresh fruit bowl, bread and tea was good, made even better by the small outdoor seating area which catches the sun in the morning.   Particularly good is the shortcut that leads from the main bazaar directly to the guest house - it's a pleasant walk way without cars.

However, there was construction going on during our stay which was noisy and there was limited use of the lounge/living room area (this was for the family only, unlike in other guesthouses in the area).

On one occasion, my husband and I were stuck in the mountains due to a landslide and we reached Niri-la only around 1 in the night. The owner was up waiting for us with dinner ready on the table.

I was lucky enough to meet the owners then and there, Kunzes and her husband, who were very accommodating and offered me a room at competitive rate. Opting for a second-level room, it was lovely waking up to the mountain scenery every morning.  This was by far the best guesthouse I stayed in whilst in Leh (2 weeks) and would recommend this place for solo travellers and families.  The guesthouse is about 5 minutes walk from the main town and around half an hour to the Shanti Stupa (which is a great walk in the late afternoon or sunrise).

There's a common room to relax in and a shared balcony that overlooks their beautiful garden with a good view of Leh's castle. On days when we didn't want to go out for food we would sit here and use the free WiFi and the owners kindly ordered us in some take away which was really excellent food.

The two greatest strengths of Niri-la are:   1. The room views are fantastic and 2. The guest house is definitely great value for money!  The guest house is set away from the main road and is in a quiet part, so you really feel the calm, and in conjunction with the view of the Leh palace and the mountains, this is quite a fulfilling combination.
