ladakh,Nothing which can excite you to come again to this property. Lack of resources and prompt service. Even the garden is not properly maintained. The first room visible on the entry is the servants room instead of reception. Seems to be complete Jugaad.,Sumit G,/Profile/584sumitg,"Faridabad, India",20
ladakh,"Good , comfortable tents and a different experience all together...never stayed in a tent before !  This place is in Hunder , Nubra valley. From this place u can go to the Nubra desert where u can take a ride on the double humped camel.  The topography is completely different from what u expect , this is a cold desert , sand dunes , camel etc ...but still very cold during the night. But the tents were very cozy and hence the climate didnt matter Tip : Electricity at the camp is only from 7pm  to 11 pm , pl ensure u charge all ur mobiles and camera during the time",Sreeshaji,/Profile/Shajiluvstravel,"Coimbatore, India",40
ladakh,This is the best tent stay in Nubra. The owner is very friendly and food is very good considering the geographical location. We were 8 friends on a bike trip and had an amazing experience! The owner also gave his phone to make some important calls.,Viranch A,/Profile/ViranchA,,50

ladakh,The place is very much of average nature. The tents are good and the amenities given are very basic. The place is so isolated that you feel out of the world. Nothing much to do at the place but is about 3-4 kms away from the white desert area.,Amey G,/Profile/AmeyGaunekar,"Goa, India",30

ladakh,No words to explain the amazing experience in Nubra Valley. It was a pleasure to stay at Chunkas Camps. The staff was always ready to help and tents were really nice and well maintained. Camp is located at a very fine location from where the view of high mountain ranges is mesmerizing. Sand dunes are so close. The area is full of greenery. We stayed here on 7 August 2014 and booked 3 tents for our group. We shall come back again.,Kaushal_rocky,/Profile/Kaushal_rocky,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"Chunka's camps -- the best option to stay in Hunder, Nubra Valley. We, four friends, visited Nubra valley on 24 September 2014. It was the end of the tourist season and a thin tourist crowd was spotted in the valley. Nights were little cold. But Nubra being warmer than Leh, we dared to spend night in Camps and our decision turned out to be a super hit idea. Chunkas have large, neat and clean cottages. Food was delicious, as mentioned by many other reviewers. The garden is beautiful and the view from camp site is extremely beautiful. The staff was cooperative, maintaining smiles on their faces every time they meet. We booked through Mr Sarfaraz Ahmad, who is operating the camps. He is really helpful and helped us plan entire Ladakh tour and also provided us with cab (Scorpio) and",SureshSharmaManali,/Profile/SureshSharmaManali,Manali,50

ladakh,"After a tough journey from Leh to Nubra, we reached Chunka Camps. I was amazed to see the facilities provided within the camps at such a difficult place where there is so much lack of resources. There were so many activities within the camp that you do not need to travel any place out side the camp. The staff was very polite and effective and were providing the things that we asked for without any delay. The camps from inside were so comfortable that the tiredness that you were feeling suddenly disappears. The en-suite bathrooms within the camp were very clean with hot water supply. I will come to food now, which was best in Ladakh. The hot food served with the delicious phulkas were the best in entire ladakh and kashmir. I would rate the Chunka Camps 5/5.",Snehil V,/Profile/SnehilV,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",50
ladakh,"A different concept from the usual hotel stay. Was disheartening at first sight but once you get used to this concept, it was good. The tents were tidy and the beds were clean. The layout of bathroom could be improved. Food was quite good.  The management took efforts to ensure a comfortable stay.",aarane92,/Profile/aarane92,"Navi Mumbai, India",40

Greenery all around which is good. Food was great! We felt as if we were eating at our home. Staff here is awesome. Very helping people. Mom was suffering from altitude sickness when we reached here from Leh they offered us lemon juice and very every now and then looking after her and helped us very much.
