ladakh,"For me, this hotel was the first real access I'd had to the internet in close to a week and so it was a bit jarring arriving back in the 21st Century, but nice in its own way.  The room I had was comfortable and quiet.    The staff was generally very helpful though a bit overwhelmed at times and so if you're there with many other quests expect to see some delays in almost any request.  It's okay, be patient and it will get done.    If you're looking for more upscale options, they definitely exist in Leh.",Rezanate,/Profile/rezanate,"Los Angeles, California",30

ladakh,The location is fantastic as so close to the main town. The rooms vary with one room we had in need of refurbishment while the other was good. The manager was excellent and so accommodating in meeting our requirements. The breakfast offering was probably the poorest in our three week stay in Ladakh,NeilParkinson1000,/Profile/NeilParkinson1000,"Dublin, Ireland",30
ladakh,We were a group of 16 persons travelling together very recently in May-2017.we were allocated 6 nos of rooms in the ground floor. Avery strong and dedicated team of 15 persons led by Mr. Vijay did almost everything to make our stay memorable. The team of Hotel Kang la Chen is really very dedicated and inclined towards customer satisfaction. They do not believe in copy book style and goes beyond their limitations to make guests feel at home,Vikramkolkata,/Profile/Vikramkolkata,Kolkata,50

ladakh,"Kang La Chen is amongst the best options you have in Leh. The rooms are cozy, clean and pleasant. All rooms have electric blankets to keep you warm as they don't provide heaters. The food is tasty and well served. They have a wonderful lounge, where you can spend your evenings idly. The location of the hotel is perfect, it's about 2 minutes walking distance from the main market. The hotel provides good hospitality as well. The only downside of this hotel is that it has timings for the supply of hot water - 6:00-9:00 in mornings and evenings, which might be a little extreme for Leh's cold weather. Overall, a good stay.",Pranjali Salaye,/Profile/travelonwild,,40

ladakh,"We went in May 2015 , stayed in this hotel for 8 nights, with breaks in between. They almost retained the same rooms after intervals also.

ladakh,I had travelled to Ladakh in the first week of September 2013 and had taken a special tour package through Cox & Kings. We had been checked-in at Kang La Chen for the first 4 days of our trip.   The first thing that grabs your attention the moment you step into the gate of the hotel is the beautiful view of the Leh Palace.... absolutely breathtaking. The hotel staff were very helpful and courteous. The rooms are very spacious and well maintained. The highlight of the rooms are the moment you step out the gallery has adjoining apple and apricot trees which you can pluck and eat as many as you want.   The buffet spread for each session is very thoughtful and tasty. The veggies were very fresh and largely cultivated within the property. The hotel staff had taken special care in,rajorshiroy,/Profile/rajorshiroy,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Rather than a 'luxury' stay at the Grand Dragon, the best way to explore Leh is from Kang La Chen. Specific hot water timings, small, but clean and comfortable and cozy rooms and relatively good food are a few features of Kang La Chen. It may not give you luxury, but it gives you the true essence of Leh and Ladakh. Moreover, its proximity to the marketplace and nearby restaurants like the Tibetan Kitchen, Bon Apatite, etc. makes life far more convenient. The small TV-room at towards the back of the hotel is so warm and comfortable and just perfect, especially during chilly nights. The TV and the couches and mattresses make the room perfect for small board games or playing cards, socializing or just watching TV. For our 15 day trip, as a group of about 16-17 people, all familiar",blinkmw96,/Profile/blinkmw96,"The Hague, The Netherlands",50
ladakh,"I have been visiting Ladhak on a number of occasions. But i am yet to see a more comfortable hotel then this. it is well equipped with a great dinning hall, with lovely hot food available with a smile. The hotel is in the heat of the city and yet has ample of space all around. it has well appointed rooms with a lovely garden",hiteshisolan,/Profile/hiteshisolan,"Udaipur, India",50
ladakh,"The hotel is well maintained and and has a cosy feel to it. It is located right next to the Leh market, which is great. The staff was very good, and gave us personalised, yet professional, service. One drawback was that hot water was not available 24 hrs and another that the room windows were not well sealed from sound - one could hear the street dogs barking through the night.  However, all in all, a recommended place for any traveller.",Varun S,/Profile/VarunS718,"Kolkata, India",40

Room: +Spacious and spotlessly clean. +Looks and feels very cozy. +Nice and clean bathroom. +Very good and clean linen, sheets and toiletries.  Location: +Very nice location. Peaceful and quiet, yet just 2 minutes walk from Leh market.  Food: +Very nice buffet with good Indian and continental choices in the menu. +Breakfast also has nice Indian and continental options, more options will be better though. +Very fresh vegetables served from their own firm. +Nice packed lunch given when we left hotel for a road trip.  Service: +Very nice trained staff, well versed in Hindi and English. +Room was well arranged and everything was in place when we arrived.

ladakh,"The hotel is just off the market area, close enough to stroll around without actually being in the hustle bustle of the market. The rooms are nice and there is a central courtyard like area to relax under Apricot trees. Hot water is on a specific time table, which is annoying when its cold most of the time. The restaurants food is good enough to fill your stomach but don't expect any gourmet delights.",avtaar,/Profile/avtaar,"Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,"We chose this hotel over Lharimo and what a good decision it turned out to be. This is a very beautiful property with spacious and comfortable rooms, a cozy lounge, small beautiful garden to laze around and a very hospitable staff you could ask for. Apart from this, another major add on is the location with a very close proximity to the main market, yet away from the noise and with rooms offering a beautiful view of a either palace or gardens or mountains.  The staff is extremely helpful and friendly and ready to serve you at any hour, be it for extra quilts at midnight or a fresh hot breakfast at 5 AM - they are there with their pleasing attitude. All in all it was a wonderful stay that we had and would definitely stay here again when we visit Leh next. We stayed at Lharimo on",SS2086,/Profile/SS2086,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"A great location, the hotel is well run, has large rooms and is very comfortable. There's hot running water about 5 hours a day. the rooms are clean and well maintained. The restaurant is fairly decent and turns out good food - breakfast is quick, and I'd recommend the home made apricot jam. The staff is very helpful, and will go out of their way to help. the apricot trees in the courtyard were in bloom while we were there, adding to the ambiance.   The property is in a quieter part of town, but only about 5 minutes walking from the market. It provides for some privacy and because it was built a while ago, has fewer rooms and smaller crowds than some of the other places I saw. Personally liked the fact that there was always some privacy and space around, as it is a fairly large",RV_1_9_4_7,/Profile/RV_1_9_4_7,India,40
ladakh,"A charming and very personal hotel near the center of Leh City, friendly and helpful staff and large and clean rooms.We consumed halfbord and the food was excellent. Mostly vegetarian, but very tastefully. There is a nice garden with apricot-trees behind the hotel for taking a tea or coffee or simply get sun. This. hotel is no place of luxury but surely one of the best places in Leh for a few days stay.",i gerryfarmer,/Profile/gerryfarmer,"Vienna, Austria",40
ladakh,"A very well located hotel just about 5 minutes walking distance from the Leh market and yet set on the side for one to experience tranquility of the himalayas!  The hotel staff is warm and the rooms are clean with clean bathrooms.  The hot water supply in the bathrooms is available for 2 hours each in the mornings and evenings.  During peak capacity, the hot water can finish before the 2 hours slot, so it is advisable either to shower in that time slot or fill-up a couple of buckets to get a bath later!  Food at the hotel was tasteful and hygienic.  We were visiting Leh and Ladakh for 9 days and the meals were inclusive in the stay arranged by Rimo Expeditions.  Which was a bliss, as we did not have to go looking around for hygienic, quality food on a tough and tiring trip like",SGtravs,/Profile/SGtravs,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"we stayed at this hotel with another couple during our trekking trip. Although we usually stayed out for most of the day, the rooms were very comfortable, and we had a great night's sleep. (Very important for trekking trips).  The food was good, they had many cuisines available. There was not much variety for Vegetarians though. The hotel was also close to the city markets.",paul9831,/Profile/paul9831,"Kolkata, India",40
