ladakh,"Checking in was quick. Room was neat and clean. Delux room had kettle, blower etc. Our stay package includes breakfast and dinner. Catering or the restaurant here is outsourced. you get good tasty vegetarian food. Though the meal was good, the outsourced contractor keeps a grumpy face and provides food as if we are eating on their mercy. There is no information on restaurant time. Every time we go, we have been told either it is too early or too late. At the same time they are good with group tour people who are their business partners. We had to rely on them unfortunately as we had a toddler who was unwell.   No wifi on 1st or 2nd floor. Have to access wifi only at ground floor.

ladakh,"Me and my wife stayed there for a week during the third week of October 2011. I landed up there in LC accidentally but turned out of to be absolute crack of a decision in our favour. All through out our stay, all the travel and local needs were taken care by the Manager, Mr. Saleem!! I must say a wonderful lad who is more than willing to help us out and make sure that our stay is comfortable enough as well as taking care of even the minute details like providing me a local SIM card, letting me drive out his car to go out to the Leh market in the night time, Making arrangements for bike rentals(The bike was delivered to me at the door steps) booking the accommodation for far away spots, arranging the cabs keeping in mind our requirements and many more. Rooms were cozy and",AbdulJaleelK,/Profile/AbdulJaleelK,"Kuwait City, Kuwait",50
ladakh,"Stayed here this year and loved the place will be going back again next year. Hotel was splendid ,rooms were luxury in detail , clean and fresh. The balcony was a treasure with the views from there spetatcular. Meals were good with a variety . Even made me cheese toast sandwiches which were divine and gave me my comfort from home.  The staff were so friendly and inviting. The manager viru planned all my trips in great detail so no stress during my time there as this was all done for me. Being alone on this trip was not a issue as I feel the staff made my holiday more complete. Would recommend this hotel to all ,as im certain viru and staff are sure to take complete care of you",jane m,/Profile/janem201,london,50
ladakh,"We went there in the first week of October, thus I felt that centrally heating was essential as the night temperatures got really low. Apart from that, the hotel was very nice and clean. Toilets clean and big. did not eat anything from the hotel, so no comments on that. The upholstery was clean, but towels were not.",namsarda,/Profile/namsarda,mumbai,40
ladakh,"There are many things why we particularly enjoyed staying in this hotel:  1. Clean, cool rooms; balcony; amazing views of the mountains.  2. 3 min walk from buzzing streets of Leh.  3. Not crouded with foreign tourists.  4. Very very tasty food and lovely staff. ( Absolutely amazing tomato soup :) which was made once again becouse we had enjoyed it so much. Have travelled alot but have never seen it happen anywhere else before. They really take care of the guests here!)   5. And last but not least - unbeilievably helpful and nice manager Rocky. He did everything - from making sure we know about meals, hot water and trips to charging camera batteries and even trying to find our last minute shopping items that we had forgotten to get :)   We felt very welcomed and pampered there.",kristine k,/Profile/kristinek440,"Brighton, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"We stayed here for a week as part of Makemytrip package. The rooms were good, the view from the terrace was good. There was enough hot water twice a day to take baths. But the food was clearly the low point. Our package included breakfast and dinner but we did not have dinner at this place more than once. Food did not taste good at all and was very oily all the time. The kitchen also was not clean.   But the staff and the manager were very helpful all the time. Overall would say it is an average hotel, ESP because of food. But then again there are not too many great eating places in leg except summer harvest and Tibetan kitchen.",MayankKhanduja,/Profile/MayankKhanduja,"New Delhi, India",30
