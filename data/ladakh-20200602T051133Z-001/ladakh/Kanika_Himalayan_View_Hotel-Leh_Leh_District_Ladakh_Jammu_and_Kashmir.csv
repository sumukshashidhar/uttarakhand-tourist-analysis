The best part is vegetables are home grown and in the same vicinity as hotel. The staff is very polite and courteous. The hotel is 15 min walk from main market. The owner Mr. Veer sir is very helpful and cooperative. He had even helped during emergency medical situation. I would say, no hotel can take care of you like this.

ladakh,"While this hotel has basic facilities; it is neat and clean. Hot water is available between 6-8 every morning and evening. They have a separate dining hall where they serve meals. The staff is very courteous and will often go out of their way to cater to special requests (e.g.: one of our group wanted curd to be served, and they procured it for the next meal) A quiet place, walking distance from the main market - I'd recommend staying here if you are on a budget.",Paleo Fire,/Profile/paleofire,"San Francisco, California",30
ladakh,"I travelled to Leh in MAy this year and stayed in this hotel. Best part about this hotel is that apart from having all basic facilities, the hotel has excellent view of mountains. It is just 15 minutes walk from main fort road and yet very peaceful atmosphere. They grow their own vegetables thus you get taste of that fresh food and they have vast space for gardening. Overall you can say it will give you a village taste with modern facilities like tv , hot water , restaurant, wifi etc. overall a good experience.",archies191,/Profile/archies191,"New Delhi, India",50
