ladakh,"We loved spending two nights here, far away from the civilization and its hassles. It is true that the facilities and service may not rank amongst the best, but that's acceptable in a remote place like this. The views from tihhe campsite aren't that great either. However, none of the properties here offer unobstructed views of the lake.",Indranil b,/Profile/IBhattacharjee,"Kolkata, India",40
ladakh,"Stayed here on the 17th of September 2018,lake is very pretty(not as pretty as pangong though).   We stayed in the building structure they own,rooms were clean and there was hot water available in the morning and in the evenings.The tall movable space Heater was a very effective,electricity is only available from 6-11 in the evening.   Food though was kinda okay,it was a traditional indian meal(Dal,rice,some vegetable preparation,papad,pickle(brined spiced version,not the american kind of pickle).It wasn't bad given the remote location but lot could be improved.   Majority of the staff was from UP(which is a really messed up place in India) and that reflected in the kind of service provided. The manager there who was a Local(Ladhaki) made up for it though with her smile and",msquare23,/Profile/msquare23,"Thane, India",40
ladakh,We visited here in September. Nomadic have 2 properties in the same locality. We stayed in Nomadic tents which has very good location and good view of the lake. Camp staff was very good. They also have one cafe where you can order food from the menu which was good. Dinner and Breakfast was quite basic but that is what you get in such a remote location .   They have double bed in the tent with double blankets. We asked for additional blanket and they easily provided us due to low occupancy. They provide half a bucket of hot water in the morning.  While booking we need to make sure that written confirmation either SMS or email should be there as it seems like booking staff does not inform staff at the ground.   Overall it was a good experience. ,Sunny_Pahuja,/Profile/Sunny_Pahuja,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
ladakh,"This place is within viewing distance of the Tsomoriri Lake. It is important to know though that there is hardly any hotel accommodation that is in walking distance of the lake (unlike some such accommodation in the case of Pangong lake).  It seems like this management has 2 properties - one which is permanent structure called Nomadic Life Resort, and the other with tent accommodation called Nomadic Life Camp. We stayed in the latter and in early Sep which was towards end of the season. Only 3 tents (out of about 15) were occupied. The tents are fairly basic but adequate - I am not sure one can expect much more in these cold conditions. The tent had a double bed (and an additional cot) with two layers of quilts. We asked for and were easily provided additional bed spreads",Sat_samp,/Profile/Sat_samp,"Bengaluru, India",30
ladakh,"We stayed here for one night. Though we had earlier contacted the property over phone /whatsapp and confirmed a  availability of a family room including the price for it(without any advance payment). But, when we reached in the evening, weâ€™re told that there is no room available. After some time we were offered a substandard room with no lightin the toilet, almost no running water (hot or cold) available in the room, the room was smelling and was in bad state. We had no option other than to take it.  But i appreciate the efforts of some young staffs who tried to meet the ends with no limited resources. Food was so so, considering the remoteness of the place. Next morning while checking out we were offfered a minimal discount. But by that time when we could manage to peep into",ADTravelerUae,/Profile/ADTravelerUae,UAE,20
ladakh,A basic tented camp located about 1km from the lakeshore with a good view of the mountains.  The tent had 2 beds with an attached toilet.  The insulation of the tent seemed insufficient.  The cleanliness of bed linen left much to be desired and the multiple blankets were difficult to manage.  Hot water was provided in the bucket at specific timing.  Electric power from a diesel generator was available from 7pm to 11pm.  Vegetarian food is served in a built-up room and non-vegetarian meals are served in a tented dining room.  The dinner was well prepared and served hot but breakfast was very basic.  The manager seemed confused about the booking and the staff seemed disinterested most of the time.,Mayur S,/Profile/135Mayur,"Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,"Tsomoriri Lake is at one extreme end of the Leh-Ladakh Range, the road also seems never ending at times.   There are very few options for stay at Tsomoriri, it has a small hamlet of residents who stay in extreme conditions through out the year there.   The accommodation is basic tent with attached bathroom, the water , climate and everything else is icy cold, hence getting up to go to the loo in the middle of the night is a bad idea.  You need to come prepared with warm clothes if you want to enjoy the breeze weather at Tsomoriri, the Camp provides for the basic needs, overall the beauty is in the location and stay at the camp.  Not to expect any luxury around this place, but enjoy the moment and life that it offers.",Allwyn D,/Profile/AllwynIvan,"Thane, India",50
ladakh,"We had booked a tent for our stay. However, once we arrived at the camp they told us that there was some confusion in the booking dates and that the tents were not free and at the same time trying to convince us that we will not be able to bear the cold in the tents and regaling us with stories of HMS suffered by Indians who had decided to stay in the tent. After much discussion, we checked into their hotel, just a building with rooms. The rooms were very basic, felt claustrophobic and the linen quite unclean.   The dining room is just outside the main building. It seemed like all the rooms were booked and they ran out of food. As a result the food prepared in haste (rice and Indian curry) was not cooked properly and we had to ask them to replace the food.",Payaltalk,/Profile/Payaltalk,"Mumbai, India",20
ladakh,"Staying at this well equipped camp was one of the highlights of our trip to Ladakh. The tents have their own separate bathrooms and two or more beds, with clean sheets. The staff was helpful and just great people, they really managed to get the best out of what is available to them, meaning - for example - we had several courses prepared for us and the other guests for dinner. (don't ever forget that the place is at 4,600 meters above sea level!)  The manager of the camp is a kind-hearted, helpful and really nice man, who helped guide us on our trip, took us to the nearby nomadic camp and told us a lot about the history of the place. If you ever get to Tso Moriri this is the place to stay.",frmn99,/Profile/frmn99,"Budapest, Hungary",50
ladakh,"We stayed here for a night in august 2017. Our agents had booked us tents but on reaching here we  were informed that for some reason the tents were not available and that we would be shifted to rooms. The reason for this shift was not clear.   The positives --- The 2 rooms were very clean though very very spartan and basic. There was no soap even in the bathroom. Felt slightly claustrophobic. The 1 storeyed building block was 500 meters from the lake shore. Not too far.  The common mess / dining room was pretty comfortable - food portions were decent as well. On bringing it to their attention that the food was not very well cooked they took action.   Overall -- given the remoteness of Tso Moriri and the weather extremes along with the high altitude, i am still comfortable",PrinceAnuraagMishra,/Profile/PrinceAnuraagMishra,"Kolkata, India",30
ladakh,We arrived end of season with no bookings made in advance. We found this property and like the view from it and thus decided to stay. We made the right descion the bed was comfortable and warm in end September the view sitting on the chairs outside was amazing. The staff polite and helpful. We were promised simple food and it was simple but very good. We enjoyed both dinner and breakfast.   The real takeaway though is the lake. Sitting outside the tent on chairs and watching the lake change color is a reward by itself. Great place to visit and stay. Do go.,Navtej M,/Profile/Navtejmatharu,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
ladakh,"We stayed for two nights at Nomadic Life under the hospitality of the amazing Sonam. From the very start, Sonam was professional, kind and helpful, but never pushy. He was insistent for us to check out other camps and hotels first to see if we would prefer anything else, but knew the value of his camp. We have never been this comfortable while camping in our life and it was such a treat. The tents were well equipped with electricity from 7pm - 11pm (standard in Ladakh), a clean bathroom with flushing toilet, a basin, mirror, and wash bucket. The staff will deliver a scalding hot bucket of water to you at any time and a cosy hot water bottle for your bed at night. The beds were a mixture of firm and soft so maybe check them out first, but all had sufficient blankets for warmth.",BriennaH,/Profile/BriennaH,"Brisbane, Australia",50

ladakh,"Nomad Camp Pangong, is in a camping area overlooking the Lake, where many other Camps are also operating. It is about 8 Km from the spur made famous by the three idiots film. It is in the first row of camps overlooking the Lake, and there are about a dozen camps in the group. The Lake is about 50 metres away from the camp site and bridle paths link it to the Lake. The view is enchanting.  The arrangement in the tents that we stayed in, were basic as is expected in camps. The sheets and towels provided were clean. The WC was quite clean and there was ample water (cold). Electricity is available from generator sets which work from sun down to 10.00 PM. There is no switch in the room and no charging point.

ladakh,"The tents were great, had everything we needed including lots of blankets! We had plenty of hot water brought in buckets each day and they even gave us hot water to freshen up after the long drive from Leh on the bikes! Very clean toilet and sink in the tents. Excellent food and we were very well looked after with hot drinks on request.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else near Tso Moriri lake.

ladakh,"Tso Moriri is the best lake and you can't afford to miss it should you plan a trip to Ladhak. The short ascent after the Nomadic Life Camp takes you to some of the best spots on the Tso Moriri. The service at the camp is good, stay is basic (beds are average - take a sleeping bag) and the food is good. In these altitudes, you need something to keep you warm and constant flow of Ginger-Water to keep you going. It's more than well sufficed in this place!",Kiran K,/Profile/KiranKBLR,"Bengaluru, India",40

We booked this property almost 2 months in advance but when we arrived camp manager was forcing us to stay in hotel rooms which is very old and dirty as camp was over booked .Finally got the tent after 4 hours waiting outside.

Cracked walls, broken tiles (room no 4), hanging shelves in bathroom, no mirror, no hot water in pipe only in bucket in morning, latches of room and bathroom are very loose and hard to use, tata sky dish's that are easily visible in the elevation are just a show piece, no balance in account. Dinning area is outside the building which is inconvenient in cold oxygen constrained area.

ladakh,Freshly made hot food is the only saving grace during your stay here. You may want to check the layout of the tent esp the bathroom. There are mighty vents and openings in the same. You want to be cautious as you use the bathroom. Half a small bucket of hot water is made available in the morning.  They do employ child labour to clean the place.

ladakh,"It was good to have a proper room rather than staying in tents at this altitude and cold weather. But the property needs lot of work to be done. The walls of rooms were having cracks, the doors were not having proper latches. Bathroom drains were not covered properly. The service was decent, was expected better. There was no provision for hot water. Only 1 bucket of hot water per room was provided in morning. Also the electricity was provided from 7pm to 11pm only. Drinking water was not supplied in rooms, you have to purchase bottle for more than 2.5 times of mrp. Better carry enough water for yourselves.

ladakh,"It was great to have a proper room at this altitude and in this cold weather. However, the camp really needs to look after the facilities it offers. The solar heating has broken down for over a year, therefore access to warm water depends on the staff. The camp is really under-staffed, but then we were early visitors in May. The water pipes to the toilets of some of the rooms are clogged and as the season lasts only from May to September could have been repaired.
