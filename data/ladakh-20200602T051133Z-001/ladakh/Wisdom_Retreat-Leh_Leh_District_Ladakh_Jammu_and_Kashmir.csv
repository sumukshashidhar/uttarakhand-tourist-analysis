ladakh,"We had a pleasant & comfortable stay, went with my friends last week.  We had booked 9 rooms. Hotel is about 10 min walk from the main market in the midst of nature. Rooms are excellent, clean & spacious . Food was tasty & felt like a home food. Staffs are extremely helpful and friendly. Owner was very helpful and always addressed to all our needs. Hotel has a beautiful garden very well maintained by the owner itself. I would definitely recommend to my friends.",dr jagadish b p,/Profile/drjagadishbp,,50

ladakh,"The Hotel is a new property (2016 is its first season). Owned by the Lamagon family, it provides a very warm hospitality, efficient service and friendly and helpful staff. The owners are all hands-on, and always willing to help, even in the middle of the night should any one need help.  The Hotel is very well Located, at only 10 minute walk from the market, yet away from the hustle and bustle.  The rooms are well appointed, bathrooms with excellent fittings. Rooms clean and bright.  It has a pretty little garden, looked after lovingly by the Lamagon family.  The food served is simple yet delicious. Like the rest of the staff, the kitchen/restaurant staff is friendly and do travel that extra mile for more demanding guests.  The hotel has wifi, but s often very weak in the rooms.",bukc,/Profile/bukc,"New Delhi, India",50

ladakh,I booked hotel through MMT . First day they gave me room near reception .... Too much noisy . After that I was shifted to first floor .... Neat n clean room with not much facilities like kettle or slippers etc . Food is horrible and no variety in food . No complimentary tea service . Staff is not active . Only the owner of hotel is helpful and sweet . ,Voyage_De_Plaisir,/Profile/Voyage_De_Plaisir,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
