ladakh,"It was our first time at the camp stay. It's a wonderful camp at a lovely location very quiet & serene in Hunder. The staff is good and the service is excellent at such a remote location, which is commendable. The food is very delicious. Every dish was cooked to perfection. The camp stay was comfortable. It's surrounded by mountains and a mini stream around it. We enjoyed our stay to the fullest. Highly recommended.",Souvik Roy,/Profile/USENTOPP59,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"This place is new - opened in June 2018 and we stayed here for 2 nights.  Approach: Hard to locate and approach road is also bad. So suggest you reach here before sunset  Place: Clean and well maintained. The tents are also new and comfortable. There is also a lovely vegetable farm adjoining the camp which you must visit.   Amenities: Clean washrooms with hot water available. However, electricity is only available from 730pm to 1030pm at night  Restaurant: Pure vegetarian. Fixed dinner and breakfast menu with a limited spread. The food quality is decent. I couldnt locate any a-la-carte menu.  Hospitality: The staff is warm and helpful.   Overall a good place to stay for 1-2 nights. Although we couldnt find any mosquitoes, carry a repellant, a torch and a fully charged power bank.",Abhishek Shenoy,/Profile/shek26,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"This is the same company Regal camps of Pagong lake, which is in fire conditions. However this camp is brand new and very, very clean and well maintained.  Staff are friendly and try their best to make you feel at home. My wife's birthday was on 16th June and the kitchen guys tried to make a cake out of whatever they had. It was a lovely gesture.
