The apple trees and the the well maintained garden are a treat for the eyes.Double beds range from 2400 to 3200/-inclusive of breakfast and dinner for two.Geyser and hot water are available.There are a lot of variety in the buffet served during dinner and breakfast.

ladakh, A 2 night stay at Kidar was quite a satisfying experience during our family vacation. Centrally located with all basic amenities & polite & helpful staff make it a great stay overall. The surroundings are very colorful due to a well maintained garden with lovely flowers & apple trees. The excellent food prepared by their cooks Birju & Vijay add to the recommendation. Do consider this place for your stay in Leh.,DRPRPANDIT,/Profile/DRPRPANDIT,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"My first impression of the hotel is its beautiful garden. It shows how much the owner look after the property. My first night was in the old building. The room is dated, has no balcony and didn't have a nice view. The other 2 nights I got a room in the new building which is lovely. It has decent size and was clean. There is strong wi-fi signal in the room, however the internet connection isn't stable which is quite common in Leh.",Jira,/Profile/oh-no-tabi,"Bangkok, Thailand",40

Facilities such as tv, hot water in bathroom even at odd hours were available. Our only disappointment was due to food. Food was tasteless and look unhygienic with weird smell. Hence we skipped it most of the time even when it was included in our package. Breakfast had very less options and taste was absent.",aartis2010,/Profile/aartis2010,"Mumbai, India",30

The property owner also stays with his family in the same propertY and is quite friendly and supportive in case we Of need.

Everything from the word go was perfect.The owner JIgmet was super friendly and he explained all the little things which one should know beforehand about leh perfectly well. He also booked our day trips including nubra valley and pangong lake at a very reasonable price.

Since then, they have built many rooms and we found further constructions were on during our stay. We liked the host as they were helpful and accommodated all our requests.  The rooms were comfortable and clean. The food was good by Leh standards (which are pretty low though).

It had just snowed and the garden in front of our rooms looked pretty. Mrs Namgil supervised our travel arrangements superbly. The food served was good,clean and not costly at all. The only drawback that we all faced was the absence of any heating arrangement in the rooms and absence of hot running water. That left us all",Mohan R,/Profile/Brownhawk,INDIA,40
ladakh,"We booked Kidar Guesthouse through Rinchen Namgial (call him NAM-gill) of YAMA ADVENTURES in Leh.  Kidar is a Ladakhi-owned and family-run guesthouse. Service is impeccable: Angchuk and her husband Chorol are friendly and welcoming and also very discreet. The house is a short walk away from the bazaar in a quiet but nice neighborhood. We had breakfast in the garden every morning (don't miss the homemade Ladakhi bread--you'll need the carbs). Angchuk's food is traditional and fresh (vegetables, momos with homemade chutney, Ladakhi skew, and if you like something special, she'll cook it for you). Besides recommending this guesthouse, Namgial prepared a very balanced travel itinerary for our 10-day visit. Namgial's English is amazing (highly idiomatic) and his knowledge of Buddhism",Okika,/Profile/Okika,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"A very nice stay in Leh with a very friendly family. Choose Rooms with garden view. 7/8 rooms, 2 very large rooms (family rooms) with attached bathroom. The garden is so nice !  Not far from the center and the taxis are so cheap !",ramseshub,/Profile/ramseshub,"Paris, France",40
