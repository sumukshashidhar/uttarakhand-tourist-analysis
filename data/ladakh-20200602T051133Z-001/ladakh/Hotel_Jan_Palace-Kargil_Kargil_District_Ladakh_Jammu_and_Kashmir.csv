ladakh,This was my second stay at this hotel.  Reached here before sunset and got a warm welcome as we had already made our bookings.

ladakh,"The manager was very humble guy and helped us nicely, the food was pure veg it was amazing considering one cannot get good veg food out in that place. Staff was helpful and good.

ladakh,"We visited this place on 27-August-2014, but your drop down menu shows only from November, 2014 so I opted for August, 2015 - please post it, if you wish to)  Me and my eldest brother travelled from Srinagar to Leh and stopped for a night halt at Hotel Jan Palace, next to State Bank of India, Kargil Branch.  The entrance is not grand but interiors were really good.  Had Chicken, Naan & biryani for dinner.  Rooms were comfortable and they served good breakfast.  For such a small place, one should not expect too much.",RAJENDRA884 PRASAD,/Profile/GuruGhummakad,"Faridabad, India",30
ladakh,Not much to be expected in a place like Kargil which only serves as a pit stop between Leh and Srinagar.  The importance of the pit stop is on the wane with the Zoji La being opened to two way traffic.  The facility was clean and the towels fresh. The food preparation was good though hygiene was missing.,Gurvin Singh Malhotra,/Profile/GurvinSinghMalhotra,"Chandigarh, India",30

ladakh,"A good overnight stay option during the road trip from Leh to srinagar.We staryed here for one niht during our road journey from Leh to Sonamarg.After having a terrible stay at Leh,this hotel was a welcome change.The staff ,especially Hafeez and Devendra Singh,were very pleasant,friendly and courteous.Althought the hotel doesnt look much from the outside,inside its a nice,clean ,well maitained hotel.The food they serve here is very tasty and they have a decent ala carte menu.We also had Kahwa from here which was very good.The hotel is located quite near to the local market.Overall,we had a pleasant and enjoyable stay.The only drawback is they have frequnet power outages,but at predefined time slots.Not sure whether the power outages were specific to hotel or to Kargil.Since the",XVoyagerX,/Profile/XVoyagerX,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",40
ladakh,"There are not many options for an overnight stay at Kargil. But it is advised, as it helps acclimatizing to the heights and the lack of oxygen before one moves on to Leh. The hotel does not have lifts and has very basic services. The food is served hot and is tasty, though again the variety is restricted. The staff is helpful. Have a torch at hand, as power cuts are frequent. Hot water is also not available 24 hours mainly due to power cuts.",Alokananda,/Profile/Alokananda,"Kolkata, India",30
ladakh,We stayed only for one night on the way from Srinagar to Leh. The hotel is located in a bylane & well maintained. The food was good - we had dinner after a tiring road journey. The rooms are specious & cleanliness including linen is reasonably good. The service is friendly - I think it is in the blood of J & K tourism. The frontage of the hotel is not impressive; however we got a mesmerizing view of moon rise from the room. Rooms have big wide glass walls which overlook the palace on the hill.,Vijay1960,/Profile/Vijay1960,"Pune, India",40
ladakh,"My husband and I stopped here for the night on our drive from Srinagar to Kargil.  We were impressed with the kindness and hospitality of the owner/manager, who seemed genuinely interested in our comfort.  His staff was also very prompt, professional and courteous.  The food was outstanding--particularly make sure you try the fried bread at breakfast, and the masala chai any time.  The room was clean and tidy and had a private washroom connected.  The hotel was noisy at night, but that almost seemed comforting, and it did eventually quiet down.  There's wifi, but it's not the strongest.",erinnicolefrazee,/Profile/erinnicolefrazee,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",40
ladakh,"We had a stopover at Kargil end route Srinagar to Leh. Kargil is one of the remote location in India. Hotel Jan Palace is a decent, clean and a basic hotel located right on the main Bazar. Just a few seconds walk from the main road. Wifi upon payment is available at the lobby, slow speed but functional. We never thought we could find such a small but clean hotel while we were really tired after a long road trip from Srinagar. Hot water available in the bathroom. Did not appreciate the lunch as price was unreasonably high. Conclusion :Highly recommended for overnight stay at Kargil.",Mizanur,/Profile/Mizanur,"Chittagong City, Bangladesh",40

ladakh,"Though Kargil has surplus accommodations, finding a good hotel for overnight stay is a bit challenge. We're really consider ourselves lucky to find this great hotel in middle of the city for an overnight stay. Great value for money and in fact if you are good at bargaining you can bring down the stay cost further. Bathroom is clean. Services are amazing. They will carry all your luggage to your room (to and fro). Hot water is available but it will come only after 6.30 am. Hotel has a good restaurant as well in the ground floor but food is bit expensive. Travel desk is also there to help you out with any inquires related to travel. They also arrange Kargil city sightseeing tours or even Ladakh package tours. Talk to the receptionist to book the tour packages.
