ladakh,"Great location. The huts look beautiful. The interiors were tacky but clean. Staff was friendly. Food was ok. Electricity was provided for 04 hrs but that's ok because the rooms are well lit and ventilated. On an overcast day when the temperature drops it could get uncomfortable. Hot water was provided. On the whole we had a great time. Carry oxygen,vasilene and moisturizer.",manjunathsadheers,/Profile/manjunathsadheers,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"I visited recently to pangong tso lake and got in touch with mr Mohit sital, who helped us booking the alpine huts resort for our stay, the property is great, in front of lake in a quiet serene location.  Staff is very friendly. Overall a nice experience.",Go662857,/Profile/Go662857,"Hapur, India",50
ladakh,"Comfortable room with elevated view of the lake but this accommodation is not lakeside as we hoped. Unfortunately the electricity is limited to 4 hours per day and there is no hot water,  which one would expect to be a basic necessity for the price. The cabins could have been designed better with larger windows and a balcony to take in the view. Staff were pleasant and food was fine. We did not utilise the living / dining areas which would be better suited to a family who requires more space.",Lillie L,/Profile/lillierl,"Ubud, Indonesia",30
ladakh,Certainly best hut in Pangong with lake view. Huts are very well built and unlike tents warm enough to stay. Staff is also good with good service.  Bad part is only that mobile networks are hardly available & electricity only from 7-11PM.,Shrenik J,/Profile/ShrenikJ38,,50
ladakh,"Now known as Changla Queen, this property owned by JKTDC has now been leased to private agencies. Earlier known as Alpine Huts, the sprawling rooms at the property are cozy and splendid, and the location just wonderful. The property comprises a set of 7-8 wooden cottages some 700-800 meters away from the lake. Getting a room here isn't easy, and anyway it always comes for a price. The roof of the rooms have now become a little damaged by winds and require some urgent repairs. Otherwise the property remains as picturesque as before. Stayed here in June 2016 and again in June 2018.",Lovers_paradise,/Profile/Lovers_paradise,new delhi,50
ladakh,"Apline Hut was a wooden cottage located just opposite to the 3 Idiots climax location .. Spacious , well maintained and beautiful place to stay .. Staff was very courteous .. Just imagine staying at a place where Pangong lake is your front view and Snow-filled mountains is your back-view .. Alpine hut is a place like that .. I would recommend this property to all the people who is planning to take a stay at Pangong ..",Rosmem,/Profile/Rosmem,"Bengaluru, India",50
