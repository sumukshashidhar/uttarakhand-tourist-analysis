ladakh,"A friend who had recently been to Leh, recommended this new property. Even though it is more popularly known for being a home stay, it has all the amenities as that of  a 3 star hotel. We travelled as family and were very well taken care by the host- Dr. Morup Dorjay; who happens to be a doctorate in Buddhism. Just down to earth guy that we learned about him from one hotel staff. The rooms were spacious and neat. There were days when we had problems with no wifi and no electricity. but that is what one has to deal with the Ladakh. It was actually good, because then we stopped looking at our cellphones and instead made good conversations with our host family. We also had some meals at the hotel, which turned out good for our taste. We appreciated it more after out three weeks of",Ankur S,,,50
