ladakh,"Rooms were basic but nice, clean and spacious. We had got ground floor rooms and had garden view from our window so we liked to keep our windows open.  All the staff were also very friendly. Lobzangbhai is manager, we had made all bookings with him and he was not there when we had checked in, still we had no problem, he had informed his staff and made all arrangements for us.  Clean rooms and clean toilet, nice view from the window, friendly staff, hot water, good food what more you can ask for..",Harshal A,/Profile/harshal88ajmera,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Hotel Lyon also commonly known as Lyon Guest House. Located at a distance of within 6 kms from Airport and well connected. This stay was booked as part of the tour package by Ladakh Back Packers. And for some reasons this time we didn't look for the review. An trust me, this place didn't disappoint us. Rooms are very spacious and have a constant supply of hot water all through the day and extending upto late evening. Hot water supplied from solar heater. As you visit Leh, only Airtel (Postpaid) and BSNL found to be working here. Data connectivity was 2G on Airtel. ",SandipanBM,/Profile/SandipanBM,"Kolkata, India",50
ladakh,"Unavailability of minimum and necessary stuffs in the room, like no carpets on the floor considering it is a cold place, no hot water in washrooms only available on request  basis for which you need to wait for 30 minutes , food quantity is limited so if you are late for breakfast or dinner , perhaps you won't get it , sad but truth as experienced. Worst part No intercom available to talk to reception so even if you need drinking water anypoint of day or night you have to walk down to reception.  It is obvious to expect NO wifi at such a hotel.",SMFirstTrip,/Profile/SMFirstTrip,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",20

ladakh,"We stayed here for 4 days during end of Aug 2016-Sep 2016.   The rooms are big, with neat and clean washrooms. There are enough plug points in the room especially on both sides of the beds, in case you need to charge your devices. Also there is a television with Tata Sky Dish, which has mostly Hindi and Sports channels. There is a geyser in each room, but we faced a situation where after one person takes a bath, it takes more than 90 minutes for the geyser to again provide hot water, and the staff provided a bucket of hot water on request. Also there was some issue with door locks on the rooms on first floor above the reception (which shall be fixed soon I believe). Mr Lobzang & the staff is on their toes and very swift to help you out when needed. Also there is a small lawn",Nisarg Mehta,/Profile/nisargmehta1,"Mumbai, India",40

ladakh,"Lyon Guesthouse became a home for us. We booked 4 rooms for our stay at Leh for 3 days. Mr. Lobzang is a gem of a person who personally took care of all our needs and requirements right from the rooms to the cleanliness to the food.  The property is situated at Chagspa road - one of the lively roads and main market is just 2 kms away from the guesthouse. The rooms are spacious and have all the basic requirements like cosy mattresses, clean washrooms, TV and decent décor. The hospitality by the team was amazing and is ever ready to cater to the smallest need to make the stay comfortable and memorable. The food was also very tasty.

All of them trried to make my visit as pleasant as possible. Lobzang took over the place recently and is trying to build a solid business. Thus you can feel that all the guys are trying to make a good job to build a reputation. The room was clean and I had a great view on the mountains.
