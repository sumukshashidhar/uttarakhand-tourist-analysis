ladakh,"On 18 June 2019, I made the booking of 8 twin sharing Tents at Pangong Sarai through a person called Norboo by paying the deposit. I brought a big group of 16 pax to stay at this property. Upon reaching the place on 14 August 2019, the person in-charge gave us the last row of Tents. He said we booked last minute. It looks like the Person whom I booked the tents with did not communicate with them properly. All tents got flooded. All the beds were together. I have to make request to separate the beds into two, ask them to wipe the floor. Basically, the toilet stinked. Dinner was ok, but Breakfast was too simple with limited choice.   At night, it was cold and windy. Again, I have to request for the hot water bag for each of us. It did not help much. The next morning, they did not",Pei W,/Profile/PeiW86,,10

When we reach Pangong and found the mad crowd busy in clicking photos like the Bollywood movie posture, we were bit disappointed. We decided to drive little far towards Man and find some camps there. The road from Spangmik to Man is equally horrible. After another round of treacherous drive through 9 KM, when we reach Man, we find the camps very expensive there. Finally we had only this camp, the price of which was still reasonable.   After checking in, we realize that we didn't do any mistake in selecting Man over Spangmik.

ladakh,"Location - some reviews complain about the extra 8km drive along a bumpy road to seclusion without wifi. But, if you’re wanting an escape from reality against a beautiful backdrop, the 8km drive is a small price to pay. Yes, the drive does take long, and it should! You should stop along the way and admire the beauty. It really is gorgeous.  Temperature - yes it’s cold. You’re camping at 14,000 ft, on a lake, in the Himalayas. I found the night to be comfortable with the blankets provided. There is a heater, but I’m not sure how much it added. Pro tip: the less you wear at night, the warmer you will be.

The quality of the tents needs to be improved. The linen was dirty and due to rains, the carpet stank. So something could be done about it. The lake is just a short walk from the tent.

With less oxygen there the conditions are very testing but what I would appreciate is that the staff there were ready to help in whatever way they could.

But the staff did try to support us to the maximum. They provided us with extra blankets and hot water bags, but unfortunately it wasn’t sufficient for us to beat the cold.

Room / Tent that they call luxury but not worth of even been called Dormatry. Only saviour was the hotel staff who were accommodating that we could survive a night at this horrible stinking room.
