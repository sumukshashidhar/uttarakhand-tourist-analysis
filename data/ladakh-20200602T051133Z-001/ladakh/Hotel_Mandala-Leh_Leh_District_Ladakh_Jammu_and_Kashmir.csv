ladakh,"When you stay in Two-star property one thing you can't demand is prompt and express service. But Mandala had superb express service.  Mandala managed by All Girls Staff, at least we didn't see any male around. Very sincere, you just have to call once and things were at your door. Next day morning requests were remembered seriously and executed dot on time.  Hot water for bathing was available around the clock, the only issue was when your neighbor is using the bath, the flow of hot water was erratic.  Food is something which we liked very much, simple, variety and on request. Their kitchen is vegetarian, but they get you non-veg dishes from outside. So win-win for both veg and non-veg guests.",drvipuljain,/Profile/drvipuljain,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"I’m happy to book a basic hotel, but then there are certain expectations within the brackets of basic.   Even though I travelled during off season when we were only a handful of occupants, I at least expected warm water (not even hot water). It was between 2-4 degrees celsius during my 2 night stay and no warm water was available.   Dinner was good, fully vegetarian dishes were served and the same went for breakfast.   The staff members were very polite, but they required some refinement. It is super awkward when someone stands watching you eat every time you eat!  The hotel offered wifi, but I’m afraid it was like the hot water, you know it is somewhere - but not there.   Location is far from the main Tibetan market, but there are little shops just up the road. ",knoesenm,/Profile/knoesenm,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",20

ladakh,"Be prepared for AMS due to the high altitude but if you have enough rest and drink a lot of water then you may be able to acclimatize with the altitude. Love to shop in Leh as they are comparatively much cheaper as compared to Srinagar. The monasteries in Ladakh are highly recommended to visit. Pangong Lake is very beautiful but again as you go thru the Changla pass at almost 18k ft above sea level, you have to be prepared to face the AMS. The people in Leh are very kind and humble. Recommended to go in summer around July-Aug.

Plus the hotel had a really nice garden.  2. Second, and most importantly, the owner (Mr. Karma Jora) and the manager (Mr. OP Sharma), did everything possible to provide us fantastic service in those two hours (and for the entire seven days). I have traveled extensively across India, and have never received such fantastic service (specifically from the owner himself).

ladakh,"We stayed at Hotal Mandala, Leh in June last year .The hotel owner Mr Karma is a gentleman. He made our stay a great one. He would ensure to meet us once every day to help us plan our Itinerary  so that we enjoy every moment of our stay in Leh.He took good care of us and even took me to the hospital when i fell sick after visitng Khardungla, the highest motorable road. We never felt that we were away from the home .The Staff is also nice and prompt. The room windows give a spectacular view of snow covered Himalayas Tthe location of the hotel is also good as its near to the Leh market. The only point of concern is the food as the food available in the market is a better choice.",anuchopra,/Profile/anuchopra,delhi,40
ladakh,"I overlooked the tips mentioned in this website as our organiser was supposed to have taken care of booking a good place for our stay But it was my mistake that was realised after reaching the place. Even though people there behave very politely, none of the work get done - you ask for it, they accept but wont do it Of the 5days we stayed there, all the days I had to fight with manager for one or the other thing - most important was the hot water - it might stop anytime; there is no timing to it, so make sure you store all the hot water needed, before starting bath, else be prepared for cold water bath! Food was bad with fewer options, that also will get over if you are little late after the starting time (7:30PM for example for dinner) It is not very very close to the market",WeTravellingCouple,/Profile/WeTravellingCouple,"Bengaluru, India",10
ladakh,"While any hotel in leh would form a base for your trip to Ladakh, this one most certainly splits opinion. Firstly the bad things : 1. Badly managed. No professionals running the shop, its completely hands on. Not great, even the attitude of the mgr is not great... 2. Some rooms are good, others really bad. Had the unfortunate experience of staying in one of the bad rooms. Note : Carpeted rooms are all bad. The ones with wooden flooring are good.  3. Warm water comes and goes intermittently, so that s a recurring problem 4. Food here , esp breakfast is not good.  Now the good part, well its Leh and comfort is not the most imp thing on your mind. So you tend to overlook some of these things. But then, you are payin for it & believe me there are other better hotels in leh which",Anivichare99,/Profile/Anivichare99,"Melbourne, Australia",20
ladakh,"Hotel Mandala is a quite, spacious and clean hotel with almost all modern amenities and a really helpful staff. It is hardly a kilometer away from Leh's main market and one can take a leisurely stroll from the hotel, around the main parts of the town and back in less than an hour. It has satellite TV in all rooms, STD & ISD facility, running hot water, a small library oriented towards travelers and spacious lawns with a fireplace for evening gatherings. One of the most striking features of the place is its in-house restaurant which is spacious and well adorned with traditional ladakhi/buddhist art. The cook is an expert in cooking traditional ladakhi, tibetian, indian, chinese and continental cuisines.  The hotel will arrange for a taxi for sight-seeing as well as to and from",Hoonar_Janu,/Profile/Hoonar_Janu,"New Delhi, India",50
