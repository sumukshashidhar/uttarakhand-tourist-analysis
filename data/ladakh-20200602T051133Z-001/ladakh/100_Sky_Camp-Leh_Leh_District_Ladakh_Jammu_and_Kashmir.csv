ladakh,"All tents here in Pangong are Good option, to Stay den Guest house. This place is a pretty average place to stay, Located very close (20-25 meters) to the lake side, this tents has average staff and service. The tents were neat and clean all the time, we stayed here for 1 night. The Dinner was veryy poor!Especially the Soups was very very spicy.  The staff is good,polite and makes your stay comfortable.",Rajesh S,/Profile/RajeshS3300,,30
ladakh,A basic tented camp located about 100m from the lakeshore offering great views.  The tent had 2 bed / 3 bed option with an attached toilet.  On a windy night the tent shook and did not cut much wind chill as the insulation was not very good.  The bed was average in comfort and cleanliness of linen and the multiple layers of blankets were difficult to manage.  Hot water from a solar heater was provided in the bucket at specific timing.  Electric power from a diesel generator was available from 7pm to 10pm.  Vegetarian meals were served in the tented dining room and the food was tasty and well prepared.  The breakfast was rudimentary.  The staff was very hospitable and provided excellent service.  Recommended for budget travelers.,Mayur S,/Profile/135Mayur,"Mumbai, India",40

ladakh,best Pangong view but in the night its chilly and cold too with this food is ok as normally vegetarian food is been served in Pangong and please carry extra cloth and water tents don't have a heater so in the night is can be freezing cold,Pratik J,/Profile/PratikJ196,,30
ladakh,A little away from the lake on a height. Gives a good view of the lake. The tent offers 3 bed/2 bed options with attached toilet. The hot water is served in the bucket at specific timing. The food is good. The tents are very basic but offer ample covers to keep you warm. A windy nigh will shake the tent but still it will be air proof. You can feel the chill and the closeness to the lake after sun is set. This becomes extremely cold after sunset. The power supply is through gen-set from evening 7pm to 10pm. The hot water is extracted from a solar heated source. The people are very friendly and service is excellent.,indian302,/Profile/indian302,"Hyderabad, India",40
ladakh,"This camp is pretty close to lake.  Tents were clean, staff helpful. The food was also pretty good. Only drwaback is there's another camp site in between 100 sky and lake. Hence you have to go a littlebit round way to yo reach the lake. It's not a straight path!",maliha j,/Profile/malihaj2015,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",40
ladakh,"The location of the camp is nice, quite near to the Pangong Lake. They have tents as well as concrete cottages. We preferred the cottages in view of the freezing cold conditions. Food was very average, but I guess most of the accommodations at Pangong provide such average meals. Hot water was an issue, yet taking into consideration about the adverse conditions, we have no complaints whatsoever. They supplied 1 bucket of hot water in the morning and we somehow managed with it. One must remember that Pangong is not a luxury tourist spot, but rather, it is a pilgrimage, where you worship the God of all Gods..... Mother Nature !  It will take a toll indeed, but well worth it !!!",drkaushikmandal,/Profile/drkaushikmandal,"Kolkata, India",40
ladakh,"I stayed at the camp site for a night. It was a very nice, pleasant and comfortable stay. Camps were clean. Caretaker was a darling. He provided his best services. Really liked that guy. Pangong tso Lake is very accessible from the tents. Lake is just in front of you, a 5 mins walk to the shore. ",yogesh g,/Profile/yguptabgh,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",40
ladakh,"We stayed in 100 sky camp as a part of our tour with Thomas Cook. The camp is OKish. Food was also average. We were provided with 4 heavy blankets and they were so heavy that we were confused for a while, whether it was to be taken over or to be slept on. The blankets were actually suffocating and none of them were over us when we got up in the morning. Only good thing was that the staff was very cooperative. They charged our devices with their personal portable chargers, which is a big deal in a place where electricity is cut after 11pm. ",Aditi M,/Profile/323aditim,,30
ladakh,The tents were very comfortable with all facilities. They provided 3 high quality blankets/comforters. The food was best in all camps nearby. We got tent with Lake view so it added extra smile. Loved the way staff handled our requirements.,ravirajani88,/Profile/ravirajani88,"Hyderabad, India",50
