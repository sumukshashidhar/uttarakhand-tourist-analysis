ladakh,"Wachan guest house location  : located In the interiors of hunder village. Service: We reached at around 12.30 pm Without having any lunch on the way. And there was nothing readily available in the guest house to eat. The hosts were nice and their hospitality really touched us. Inspite of all the climatic and material availability related adversities they offered the guests with their best. No mirror or shelf in the room.  Heater is certainly extravaganza in such scenario. Hot water available only in the morning. What I liked: the dining hall with low Japanese style dining. Though it was cold outside the rooms were cozy and blankets super cozy.  Points for improvement: a mirror can be provided in the room, though there is one in the bathroom.",Madhu172014,/Profile/Madhu172014,"Kolkata, India",30
