ladakh,"Me and my friend planned for a month long trekking trip in J&K through June and July '18. But as we were trying to scale the Kashmir Great Lakes trek, extreme rain made it almost impossible and adding to our worries my friend fell and injured his right arm. Not knowing what to do next, we hesitantly headed towards Kargil after hitchhiking on a truck. He was in need of immediate medical assistance and since we were carrying almost 30kgs each, finding the hospital in Kargil would have become a lot more difficult if we were not offered help by a complete stranger. He gave us a lift to the hospital, told us that he owned a hotel in Baru in case we are unable to find one by nightfall, came back to pick us up and took us to his hotel where we stayed the night. The stay was wonderful.",Arindam M,/Profile/ArindamM173,,50

ladakh,"We stayed twice at this hotel within one week in June 2018. It was our base while going and coming back from our Zanskar trip. The hotel is a little distance away from the crowded town, which is why we chose it in the first place. The Ali brothers were excellent hosts, and went out of their way to help guests. Some examples of their hospitality: Ali Sr (Akbar) accompanied me to a mechanic's shop and helped me get my car repaired. He even helped me with a letter from a high-ranking government official as permit for visiting Dha-Hanoo villages were not available on that day due to a public holiday. I can't thank him enough for that.

It is also very nice to see Ali combating the low supply of waver and vegetables by computing and planting his own food served in the restaurant.  I will miss the delicious food and attentive staff.,Adrian A,/Profile/AdrianA1077,,50
ladakh,"""From 18th to 21st"" - This is the most memorable quote from our trip, uttered by Ali Asgar from Barula Hotel. We really appreciated the personal sharing by Ali on his experiences growing up in Kargil, as well as as his aspirations for the hotel. It is always refreshing to meet up and chat with locals who are passionate about the location's history, society, and culture. Although there were some power issues which affected the water temperature in the shower, it would be a perfect stay at Kargil once it is settled. Our room was clean and food was not bad. The hotel was also expanding, and we have no doubt that it would be a fantastic stay for guests once it is completed. Highly recommended!",Jon L,/Profile/JonL2151,,50
ladakh,"It was getting dark when we drove into Kargil and we had no idea where we were going to stay. By a sheer stroke of incredible luck we met a manager  from Baru La in the street and he persuaded us to have a look at this new place (some parts of it are still developing and under construction).  As soon as we walked in we fell in love with the hotel: the rooms were comfortable,sparkling clean and spacious, the bedsheets and towels  crispy snow-white, the views from the window (in the morning) beautiful and unobstructed (as the hotel is situated slightly uphill away from the main road). The food in the restaurant was very good too. But what impressed me most of all was an incredibly friendly and hospitable staff! They went out of the way to make our stay as comfortable and care-free",svargamarga,/Profile/svargamarga,"Moscow, Russia",50

The rooms are nice, but the bathrooms had leakage, and hot water supply issues due to poor maintenance. the food was bad, delayed, cold, and quite a disappointment.

ladakh,Awesome experience at Barula Hotel. Stayed there during a bike trip. Had to extend the stay due to Kashmir unrest. Many thanks to the Chef for serving us the best food. The best part is the campfire place and Jam session.

ladakh,So here is the story how I got to know and reached the hotel. Me with my friends reqched kargil after a long and tiring day of crossing zozila. As we entered the kargil a guy stopped us and asked if we were looking for hotes which was obvious as we were not locals. So he asked he will not ask us to stay in his hotel but just wanted us to visit it once which was strange. He said he will also help us find best hotels in kargil. Now this was something we never have seen or heard... so we agreed as this was the first time for all of us in kargil. He hopped in and on his way we checked out many hotels and finalised a few which we would be using for our stay but as promised we decided to check his hotel as well.
