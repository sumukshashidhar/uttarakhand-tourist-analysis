ladakh,"Stayed in Al karim for a night halt on our way to Leh. It was the time of muharram in september. All the staffs were in leave except the owner. The hotel was nearly empty. We got a 6 bedded room only for 1500. The hotel is neat & clean, 2 km down from crowded kargil main market. Rooms are good with geysers. View of river suru and mountains are exellent. Recommended if you dont want to pay much for just a night stay & wish to stay in a quite place bit far from the chaos of main bazaar.",SaptarC,/Profile/SaptarC,"Kolkata, India",40
