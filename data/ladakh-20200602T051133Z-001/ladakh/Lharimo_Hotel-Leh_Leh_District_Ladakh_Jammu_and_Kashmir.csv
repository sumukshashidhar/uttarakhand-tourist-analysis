ladakh,We visited this place in June 2019 and we stayed here for 4 days. The food in this hotel is nice there services are also very good. This hotel is at 10 minutes walkable distance from leh market. Rooms have wooden roof to keep the room warm as the temperature gets very low in the night. They also have a cottage in Nubra valley which more awesome than this place. The overall look of this hotel is like typical Ladakhi type with a lawn in middle.,Nusta_Firasati,/Profile/Nusta_firasati,"Dombivli, India",50

ladakh,"We stayed here for 4 night in last week of August. After having issue with the hotel booked, we found this hotel @11:00pm.  Pros:- Good located Hotel Big & clean rooms, ventilated & sunlight all day Tidy and clean bathroom Hot & cold water all day Market only 5 min by walk. We tried only buffet breakfast @ that was fine. Garden area is USP of this hotel. We spent hours there under sunlight and under tree shade too. Guy on reception is very friendly and helpful. Hotel staff is so obedient, we checked in @11:30pm and checkout @ 5:00am, 3~4 guys were ready to help us in transferring luggage. I was so impressed to saw their gesture. When we went to pangong Lake and on our checkout, both days we started our journey @5:00am, both day they cook Indian breakfast early for us and we left",Surinder R,/Profile/940surinderr,,40

ladakh,"We spent 3 days at the hotel. The room was spacious and clean. Wifi worked only now and then, but it was  the same everywhere we went in Ladakh. Bathroom was clean and there was plenty of hot water all through the day. The restaurant offers the classics and quality was good. We did not try the Western menu. Communication is sometimes a problem since the staff does not always understand or speak English. After a walk through busy Leh, it is always good to find peace in the small but rather beautiful garden. There is a laundry service, but as in a lot of places in India, don't give fragile fabrics to be washed. They'll come back ruined.",Travelman-Tx,/Profile/Travelman-Tx,"Keerbergen, Belgium",30

The hotel is at just 10 min walk from the main Leh market. My visit was during the summer when Leh was pretty hot during the day.

Pros:- 1) The front rooms specially on 2nd and 3rd floor have awesome view of Stok Kangri   (highest peak in the Ladakh Valley  about 7134 mts ) .You can enjoy the view all through the day as Leh is one of the place which receives least rainfall in whole south asia hence clear skies are expected .Even if you are lucky enough you can have a good view on full moon night . 2) Rooms are good and spacious , nice king size bed with a good cupboard(no lockers) TV with 100% digital service .A study table set , a couch and a well lit interiors. 3) Wify service is 24*7  but",indrajit s,/Profile/Indrajit_Bublu,"Kolkata, India",40

The service is really poor, the staff doesn't really care, they didn't clean our room after our arrival. We noticed the staff combing their hair in the dinning hall when all the guests were around. The nights were really noisy, lots of dogs barking around the property, the sleep quality is really poor. We went their in the summers and it was pretty hot they did not even have fans in the room.

Management said yes and told kitchen staff we would be coming late. At 930, we were told kitchen closed. Breakfasts are basic buffet. Cold omelette, stale toast. There are better dining options in Leh. Wifi is only available in the garden and only works well enough to aggravate. Pretty much basic email only. Bathroom worked well. Room basic but clean.

We had an astounding experience back there. The food is great in quality and quantity. The yard adds on the beauty of this wonderful hotel and at night the lights are cherry on top of the cake. The luxury of silence and cool breeze throughout the evenings gives you a soothing experience. The service is good and quantified. The main purpose served was silence, after the tiring touring around we resumed back to comfort of the well served rooms that make you feel like heaven.

ladakh,"We stayed at Lharimo hotel for 5 nights in June, 2016. The compound is quite spacious and very clean. There is an outdoor sitting area beautifully decorated with a lot of trees and plants. One can also enjoy the scenic view of snow capped mountains from their terrace and rooms in the top floor.  We were provided a room in the ground floor. Although the room was good, the washroom was below standard. On the day when we checked in, the washroom had an awful smell, and water was leaking from the wash basin. However, hot water was available throughout the day.  The dining area was decent and the food was good, but the service is slow as there seemed to be a shortage of staff. The kitchen does not prepare lunch unless informed in the morning. You might have to haggle with the staff",junket15,/Profile/junket15,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
ladakh,I recently stayed at this hotel during a two week trip to Ladakh. The hotel is very well maintained well designed and tastefully decorated. My room was very clean and hot water was available most of the time. I believe the hot water is supplemented by solar heating and when the sun was out the water was very hot.  The food in the restaurant was also very good despite it being the end of the season and very few people being checked in. Also the staff were very helpful and friendly.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone needing a comfortable hotel in Leh.,Jason H,/Profile/674JasonH,"Wimborne, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"We stayed at this hotel twice - before and after our trek up Stok Kangri, and loved it. It is not a four/five star hotel (and don't go in expecting that) but it had a beautiful, simple and rustic charm that made it homier than a lot of international chain hotels we have stayed at previously. The hotel is conveniently located on Fort Road, so it is a short walk to restaurants, travel agencies and even to the main markets and bazaars.   The inner courtyard of the hotel had a beautiful garden that we loved to sit in - to read, to enjoy the beautiful blue skies and relax. The hotel itself looks built itself on an oriental architectural design, which also created a peaceful atmosphere.   The rooms are very basic. We had hot water for showers and the beds were comfortable and warm",rwyhuang,/Profile/rwyhuang,"Toronto, Canada",50

Sheets and towels did not feel clean.Loud building work was going on outside.Staff were ok and didn't seem to worry too much about anything we said!

The staff is helpful but slow to respond. The food quality is not consistent. Breakfast is the worst. Mostly buffet is available for breakfast, lunch & dinner and you can only order tea and coffee or soft drinks separately and sometimes Maggi(after a no. of requests). Its location is the best as its very close to the marketplace so you can just walk down.

ladakh,"Any traveller to Leh will be aware of the fact that there aren't too many luxurious accommodation  and 5 star properties in the city.  What works for Lharimo is the location , it is located close to the leh market at the end of the lane.  The hotel building and the lawn area are both well maintained.The rooms are clean but they first like to get rid of smaller sized ones, so if you are not happy with the one you have been allotted , request them for a better one.   The service leaved a lot to be desired. The intercom does not work and we had to leave early in the morning for sightseeing so we had to go down for any kind of assistance early in the mornings.

The bed was medium comfortable but linens were in exceptional shape, very good.  Leh has limited electricity so hot water is a timed commodity.  I was there in Sept 2011 and had 2 hours hot water in morning & evening.  Plan for that.  The food was hearty and healthy, but nothing special.    Practical advice:  if you need even a little pampering this is not the place for you.  (And maybe Leh isn't either. ) The garden area in the center is a great place to gather with friends at end of the day.    Would I stay here again?

If you plan to stay at the hotel its better you have your lunch and dinners outside. Breakfast served is good but has no variety.  Just outside the hotel gate you will find lot of eateries which serve good food. Ten min walk from the hotel you reach the Leh market. You can book your taxi from the Leh market.
