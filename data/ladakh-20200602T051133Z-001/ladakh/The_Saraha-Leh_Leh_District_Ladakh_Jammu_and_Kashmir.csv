ladakh,"Me and my friend had been to Leh this September  and stayed at ‚Äú The Saraha ‚Äú , Just like the place , this hotel is very  lovely and very comfortable. A beautiful garden and well maintained rooms .. All the staffs were so cordial and we felt very much at home  more than anything very safe . The owner Mr Stanzin ensured that we travel safely and comfortably and he was always available when in need . We had a great time at Leh and this was possible because of Mr Stanzin and his ‚ÄúSARAHA‚Äù. I strongly recommend ‚ÄúTHE SARAHA‚Äù in Leh .",Radha Rajesh,/Profile/Radha-Rajesh2000,,50
ladakh,Stanzin - the owner of The Saraha is a perfect host and a good human being. He personally takes care of everything and is very responsive and so is staff. Of course there is always a room for improvement. The construction around is spoiling the place a bit.

ladakh,We stayed in Leh for a week and stayed in Saraha for last 2 days of our trip.The stay in Saraha was pathetic.Staff is very poor.They didnt even respond properly.glasses in room were not clean.We payed in advance for breakfast and dinner and on going there they told bfast is cancelled as no other guest in hotel.in ala carte they have limited options and that too tasteless.the staff itself told that the food is 3 to 4 days old which they served us.Again dinner also got cancelled for which we had paid.They dont welcome guest properly.They saw us when we arrived but they did not come to take luggage.our driver carried our luggage.they came later.earlier they were just watching us.on arrival we asked for tea and bread toast they told us they cant as kitchen is closed at 4 pm.On,pooja s,/Profile/poojas2911,,20

A special mention about DINESH(Manager) who runs a great crew and who made our stay special and went above and beyond by lending us use of his personal phone and catering to our needs during our bouts of altitude sickness. A few things worth mentioning are the large spacious rooms, huge comfy beds, beautiful lawns and garden setting,delicious food(kadai paneer, chilli cheese omelette, aloo paratha, jeera aloo and chicken curry to mention a few) and great cascading showers in the bathrooms.

ladakh,We had the privilege of being the first guest at The Saraha and I must say the Team Saraha made us feel special at every moment of our week long stay at the amazingly luxurious property. Mr.Stanzin (owner of the property) was personally there not only to welcome us but had also arranged for cake for my birthday which touched me a lot and he ensured that we felt at home all throughout our stay at The Saraha. Mr.Stanzin is an expert professional when it comes to planning your future day activity and he ensures you get to see the best of the region by giving personalized service. The Saraha is ideally located amidst natural beauty and the Leh market is just 5 mins walk. All the rooms are very spacious  with clean environment and has balcony giving an excellent view of snow covered,Pratap K,/Profile/905pratapk,"Panipat, India",50

A quiet place where one can soak in all leh has has to offer. we were surprised to find that it was not all that far away from the town. perfectly located.  Our stay was thoroughly enjoyable and the service was nothing short of excellent. The exterior of the building is spectacular with a  beautiful garden where we spent most of the time while in the hotel. The rooms are spacey with all the comforts one would find in a luxury Hotel. The staff, always courteous and efficient. The food was also great. Overall, we would rate it as one of our most enjoyable experience.

ladakh,"As part of a 9 member Group, we got a booking at The Saraha as a Base Camp for a 7 night / 8 day trip. Stanzin (The promoter) was personally there to not only welcome us on arrival but also ensured we felt ""at home"". Both him as well as all his staff are extremely warm, courteous and ever helpful - always around with a smile irrespective of time of the day!   The rooms are excellent - clean, very spacious, comfortable and with an awesome view. The food was tasty, with the staff ready to make whatever dishes it was that the Group wanted to eat for a particular meal. They often went out of their way to make us feel special!   Free Wi Fi was a boon as well (considering data services were not functional on any of our mobile phones).   From a location perspective also we found it",rl1901,/Profile/rl1901,"New Delhi, India",50

ladakh,My husband and I stayed at The Saraha for 5 nights and our experience was nothing short of excellent. Firstly the location is fabulous - not too far away from the city centre where you can enjoy the peace and calm overlooking beautiful snow capped mountains. The staff was really good and well trained and the rooms were very comfortable and spacious. Wifi available in the reception area. Their in house kitchen served comforting home style food on demand. The owner Stanzin Norboo was always around and we enjoyed our conversations with him over a cup of ginger lemon honey tea or while he tendered to his well kept garden. We were really touched when Stanzin took my husband to the hospital when he fell sick. Truly a home away from home !,JoannaKukreja,/Profile/JoannaKukreja,"Mumbai, India",50

The rooms are very spacious and equipped with all the amenities that one would typically find at a 5 star property. Although the property does not boast of a formal restaurant, Meals are available in the hotel at request and are customised to customer's palate. Rooms on the front side afford a beautiful view of the snow capped peaks in the distance, overlooking a well manicured garden.  As long as BSNL is kind, WIFI is not an issue at the property.  The staff at the property is very kind and hospitable. Do Check with Stanzin, the owner, about the places to eat at and explore in the city.

ladakh,"An Oasis of warmth and homeliness in Leh, Saraha has ten well appointed rooms, friendly staff and above all, Stanzin Norboo, the proprietor, who made me and my 12 year old son feel so much at home from the moment we arrived at the Hotel. We stayed for four days;   11th and 12th , 14th and 16th June 2015. The rooms were tidy, well maintained and sunlit; I mention sunlit because natural light in the room for me is important. Located on Fort Road, this property is conveniently situated, offering easy access by foot to Leh Town's main market.  The only flip side is that it is yet to start its in-house restaurant though meals and snacks are available through Room Service. But since we were sightseeing and had most of our meals outside, it was not an issue at all. There is wi-fi but",Laimayum,/Profile/Laimayum,"Imphal, India",50

He especially called his father to help me in my trip as we were going places which were less traveled. As his father knew the valley well he told us about all the good points that we shud take care of. Stanzin(the owner) helped us in all possible ways. Best stay in the whole trip and good food.
