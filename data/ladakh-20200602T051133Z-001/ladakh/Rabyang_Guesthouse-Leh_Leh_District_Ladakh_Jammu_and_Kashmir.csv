ladakh,"I stayed here few times before. The guesthouse is situated in a small alley on Changspa Road, which makes the guesthouse a very quiet place. Although it’s in a small alley, but it’s not far from sightseeing places nearby.  The room is warm and clean. Cozy tables and chairs are placed outside the room in the garden. The friendly owner family would greet me whenever they saw me, makes me feel very welcoming to stay here. The family also welcome their guests to visit them and sit in the house for cups of tea.  They provide laundry service at reasonable charge and the service is good. I sent my clothes for laundry after I came back from trekking.  Recommend this place.
