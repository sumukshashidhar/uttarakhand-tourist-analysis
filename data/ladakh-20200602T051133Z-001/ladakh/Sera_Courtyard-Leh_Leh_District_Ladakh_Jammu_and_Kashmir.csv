ladakh,"We spent several days at this hotel and we felt like home :  warm welcome, friendly staff, excellent service and good food.  The manager and his staff did a great job to make our stay enjoyable, always there to help meet our needs.  Mohan and Umesh at the restaurant took good care of us :  suggestions of local dishes, customized meals and great service.  The room was spacious and very comfortable with hot water 24/7.  We enjoyed very much our stay and were very satisfied.",Renee,/Profile/ReneeD14,"Montreal, Canada",50
ladakh,We visited Leh from 24th to 30th September 2019. Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. Beautiful large room furnished with large king bed with nice mattresses. Double glazed glass windows with beautiful view. Attached bath with showere's stall and ultra modern fittings. All the staffs are customer friendly always eager to help. Food quality and quantity is very good. Manager Mr. Lendup is very helpful and guides the guests about aclaimatization.,santabhanu,/Profile/santabhanu,"Kolkata, India",50

ladakh,"Good spacious rooms with natural light from the full glass windows. Very polite and helpful staff, but still does not compensate for the below negative point!  Only thing disappointing was: Why the discrimination in restaurant service & options for full paying customers on different days based on their occupancy rate? When they had full occupancy in hotel then they had good buffet style breakfast and dinner. But when only a few rooms occupied, then no buffet.. OK..that is understood.  BUT on those a la carte days.. excuses that ""Tandoor is not ON and Grill /Oven is not ON"" because not enough guests...ultimately resulting in very few & tediously repititive options of vegetarian dishes for breakfast and dinner. Dessert being limited to two options of regular canned stuff, nothing",kshodh,/Profile/kshodh,"Ahmedabad, India",30
ladakh,Hi stayed there from 29 June to 5 th of July for my leh trip.itbis nice small deluxe hotel with basic amenities like restaurant etc.There is no spa or extra activities to do.The parking space is also very small. About the rooms I could say they are good enough for the price one pay but bathroom needs shower partitions. The best thing is there food and service with personal touch.The staffs are really very caring . Overall a nice hotel,rajesh Ghy,/Profile/rajtrips,"Guwahati, India",40
ladakh,Our most favorit hotel that we stayed at in India. Such lovely and courteous staff! Rooms were always tidy and food was always nice and well spiced. Hotel is only 1 km away from city center.  Thanks for everything!,Andrea K,/Profile/206andreak,,50
ladakh,The rooms were good but the window shades were light and let through a lot of sunlight .. additionally the chef is really bad.. during the buffet the dal was very less so we asked waiter to get more.. the chef added water to the dal and sent to our table.. we had to make noise for him to fix a fresh portion of it.. you charge so much money for buffet at least serve proper food.. the card machine doesn't work and you have pay in cash.. wifi is too slow..,bhoomimehta,/Profile/bhoomimehta,"Noida, India",30
ladakh,The new wing in the hotel is a very good option for staying in Leh. A smaller hotel with very good staff and good (if quite rich) food. Important to note - they do not offer room service and wi-fi is spotty.,vaipatel,/Profile/vaipatel,"Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,"I have visited Ladakh more than 16 times as a travel photographer and stayed in multiple properties but almost from last 4 years, this is my favourite hotel. I like the hotel because of:  1. The owner himself Mr. Namgial is the super cool guy 2. Staff is very prompt 3. Hot running water 24 hours 4. Comfortable beds 5. Neat and clean rooms/washrooms  6. A bit modern look of the rooms 7. Value for money 8. Food is decent and well cooked, you cannot expect lavish cuisines at that altitude.  9. Walking distance from the main market  Conclusion: Best property if you are ready to spend (within limits of course) and want value for money. Highly recommended for families. I have recommended this to so many friends of mine who travelled Leh with their family and all of them gave me",Abhishek S,/Profile/WeChitra-Abhishek,"New Delhi, India",40

ladakh,"A very rare to see in service industry where the entire staff scores a perfect 10. Be it the stay, food, location and service, I would term it as Outstanding. The Khatri team in the kitchen were all ears to our special needs and served Jain food whole heartedly and going out of the way to serve it before sunset. Thank him for delicious food and  varieties during our 5 days stay.   Also the Manager Mr. Jimba was always there to help us and was sensitive to all our request.   The staff were courteous and helpful.  Will stay there next time too !!",Nevil S,/Profile/911nevils,,50

ladakh,"We were very lucky to have found this place. We had pre-booked another hotel which was horrible and we left on the moment we arrived, so we saw this one, fell in love and stayed. The manager is amazing, very caring and nice, he helped us book a trip to Pangong lake with a very good price. The rooms are really clean, spacious and with heating which is utterly necessary. And the breakfast is amazing! ",Doug,/Profile/dodsouza,"Sao Paulo, SP",50

ladakh,"The hotel looks good from the outside, but has several issues. The service is very impersonal and not warm, as compared to the other places where we stayed. WiFi does not cover the top most floors. The top most floor becomes very hot in summer and with no fans in the room and no pedestal fans provided by the hotel, the stay was very uncomfortable",Shanthi P,/Profile/883shanthip,,30
ladakh,Hotel is about 2 years old.  The room has good space.  The restaurant offers reasonably good food.  Hot shower works well and they have power generator back up.   Hotel staffs are very helpful.  The location is near the airport but not in the city centre/market area.   The internet was slow during our stay but it seemed to happen for the whole Leh town the same.   Overall this hotel offers good value for money & I would recommend it.,zakBKK,/Profile/zakBKK,"Bangkok, Thailand",40

We were on the afternoon sun side of the hotel (room 202) and it did get very hot. We were fine with the fan, but if you are an air con addict this side is probably too hot.  The food was very tasty and all the staff were pleasant and friendly. It is a little walk from the centre of town, but it was pleasant to be in a quieter spot.

ladakh,"Recently I , with my family and friends stay here from 26th to 1st August . We found this hotel is NOT 3/4 star , it is an average hotel with very high rates , probably they are paying good brokerage to tour operators( like our makeyoutravel.com )in Delhi . Most of their gadget and amenities are non functioning ,surprisingly at temperature of 28 degree Celsius , they do not have AC/ fan in rooms. There is no room service , no one to pick telephone at reception , very poor/ rude front desk , no tourist maps or information available at reception . Most of the time WiFi is not working / poor working very slow . Only good thing is they have good Kitchen and food service in dining hall .

ladakh,"We stayed in Sera just for 2 nights and we loved this hotel. Very near to the market. Awesome rooms. Though we stayed in the roof top room, it was little hot since the weather outside was also pretty hot in the afternoon. They are still constructing the building and I am sure once its done it will be much better. Very good staff and they gave us good discounts when we approached them.
