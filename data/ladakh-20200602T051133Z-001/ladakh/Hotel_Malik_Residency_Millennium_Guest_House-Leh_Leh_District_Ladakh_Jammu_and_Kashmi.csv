ladakh,"A new property with well laid out cozy rooms. I was traveling solo and was guided to this by an acquaintance.  Food has limited options(Indian only) but tasty. There were a  few teething problems like slow generator backup and no hot water but the staff made timely arrangements like candle in the room and bringing in a bucket of hot water. The wifi was reasonably fast(by Ladakh standards). In all, it has good potential under the current staff and can be good if maintained well.",Abhinav Sharma,/Profile/Abhinavsharma079,,40
ladakh,"The location is only a 5â€“10 minute walk from the main market and the center of Leh. It's on a road that is a little busy in the daytime, but it's generally pretty quiet at night. Rooms are comfortable and there is a nice terrace to sit out on. Wifi is free.",Peregrineri,/Profile/Peregrineri,"New Delhi, India",40
