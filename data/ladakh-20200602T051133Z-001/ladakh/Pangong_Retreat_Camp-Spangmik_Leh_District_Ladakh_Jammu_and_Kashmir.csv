ladakh,"A much better tent, well protected. The cabin very comfortable and clean, as well as the bathroom.  Hot water only in the morning, electricity from 7pm to 10pm.  Extremely nice and friendly staff, though young. They even brought tea to the tent. Nice food in a pleasant dining place, with Buddhist style decoration, and a large common seating area that offers lake view.  At night, besides the extra blankets and hot water bottles, they provided a jug of hot water for toilet purposes and drinking water. The view to the lake was splendid.

Though a little away from banks of Pangong Lake, the location offers breathtaking view of the lake and surrounding mountains. Dining hall is large, warm and cosy. Quality of meals are adequate.

ladakh,"This camp is located at a bit of distance from the lake and the road leading up to the camp is in a dilapidated state (just like almost all other roads in Leh). The two major points worth noting are that the electricity is available for merely 5 hours out of the whole 24 hours, and hot water for shower is available for only 1 hour i.e. from 6:30am – 7:30am. Whatever you do, you have to plan according to those timings and mostly everyone in Pangong has similar restrictions. Least to mention, there are no TVs and absolutely no Wi-Fi available.  The tents are clean and so are the toilets. The food they served was good enough and the staff had been really helpful.

ladakh,"We were two couples travelling to Pangong and chose to stay at Pangong Retreat Camp.  We couldn't have chosen a better place to spend the night. The camp, though a 10-15 minute walk from the lake, offers excellent views. If a location adjacent to the lake is a priority, then this place should be avoided since it is impractical to make multiple trips to the lake in a day.  In terms of rooms and amenities, this place probably offers everything you can hope for in such a remote location. We were the only guests staying here that particular day and got dinner/breakfast of our choice. The staff was really helpful and accommodating. They have a large common seating area that again offers lake view.

The camps are very well set and offer great view. The food spread is good and quality is nice.

Very nice one's with a door and glass windows, top class bathroom, nicely insulated to protect from cold winds and a view to die for. Having said that, the kind of price you pay for this, the least you will expect is clean linen, hot water in bathroom, duvet or quilts good enough to take care of temperature -10 degree or so and a geyser. For me, I had taken 2 tents for my family booked about 2 months in advance. On arrival I was told that they had no confirmation and they had no network to connect with their Leh office.

ladakh,Stayed for a night with my sister at this camp. Overall stay was reasonably ok.The tents are of good quality and beddings were comfortable. It was very chilly due to high winds and snowy storm. There was no hot water even though they claimed to have solar panels for the same. They provided hot water bottles and enough of blankets to keep you warm.Staff was ok and requests were entertained as per asks. Food was of reasonable tastes. I would say if you get a good deal then this would be a good option. Only thing is this tent is not bang in lake but is some walk to the shore.

The remoteness of location is all the more evident when seen from my high vantage point. The few houses are scattered like dots in a landscape dominated by the long blue stretch of the lake and the barren mountain slopes.

ladakh,"We stayed here for 1 night, Tents are very nice and clean, Nice view of Pangong Tso with Mountains behind it, Also behind the tent there is nice view of mountains.  Food served was worth every penny we paid, didn't see such nice service, Dinner had everything from soup to desert and breakfast also was very nice.  Would definitely recommend it.

ladakh,"One can never have enough of the marvelous Pangong Tso, so its a dream come true that one has the opportunity to stay overnight at the lake. The tents were, contrary to popular belief, quite comfortable. We were provided really, really heavy quilts to ward off the cold (it gets really cold because of the wind). The tents had attached toilets too! The view from the camp of the lake was excellent. It was very close to the shores and had great service staff. Considering people were endlessly pestering them for more tea and coffee, they were so, so polite and friendly! Overall, an excellent place and considering the remoteness of the location, more than what one can hope for.",TheCreatist,/Profile/thecreatist,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"The first thing you would notice about Pangong retreat camp is the distance you need to traverse from start of the Pangong lake till you reach this resort. it does take you almost 30 minutes to reach the same starting from the start of the lake. But once you reach its a mystique beauty which sorrounds you. Its almost one of the last reasorts on Indian soil if you travel through the length of Pangong. a short 5 minutes drive from there would take you to seclusion, where mighty nature will enthrall you. Its a scary beauty to be honest. You literally feel anytime a sea monster would spring up.  As per the accomodation is concerned its ok. You get a tent to stay in with an attached toliet. Quite ok food compared to the far fetched location. Staff is very friendly,  Note: Make all",Siddharth Roy,/Profile/disissid06,"Mahadevapura, India",40
