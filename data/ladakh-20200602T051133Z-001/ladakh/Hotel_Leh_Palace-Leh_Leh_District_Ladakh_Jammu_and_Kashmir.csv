ladakh,We were just for a night while returning from an expedition. They hotel has many things inside the rooms but lot of them donâ€™t work. The hotel staffs were bit wired.   Some foods were good while some were not. I would give a mixed feedback and will suggest to go for alternative options.,Supratik,/Profile/SupratikN,"Bangalore District, India",20

ladakh,No need to carry oxygen cylinder for normal people. 1 day is enough for acclimization.  They charge even if u don't use t cylinder. Very sad policy of singee  palace hotel. Pangong Inn is best in pangong. Nubra to pangong go by sanyuk river. No need to go to leh first and then pangong. Atv bike and double hump camel must in nubra. Sangam trip must in leh. ,piyushd_12,/Profile/piyushd_12,"Kolkata, India",10
