ladakh,"We sort of stumbled into this place - in Leh, as they say, you dont have to prebook any hotel. So, we arrived(read: returned) after a 2-day trip to Lamayuru, and they hotel we had stayed the first day dint have rooms. This place had accommodation and so, we decided to go here. The property is a 2 floor property. Usually the ones on upper floor cost more. The owner asked for 800 per room (which,compared to Leh standards is a bit expensive) and finally with some negotiation, we got it for 600/-.[August 2012] (Later, we could hear some bickering between the owner and his wife on how he should not have given it for 600). That apart, the place is very good, the rooms vast, spacious and spic and span, with no trace of dirt. Bathrooms, the best !! Our bathroom on the ground floor also",Vinod,/Profile/ramansvinu,Bangalore,50
