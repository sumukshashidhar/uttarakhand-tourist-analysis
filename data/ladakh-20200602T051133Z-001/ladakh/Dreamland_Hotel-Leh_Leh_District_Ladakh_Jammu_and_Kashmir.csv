ladakh,"We had an absolutely fantastic Markha Valley trek with Dreamland. We greatly enjoyed the trek itself and, most importantly, our guide (Gurmet), cook (Stanzin), helper (Lobzang), and ponyman (Tashi) were fabulous.   Gurmet knew huge amounts about the mountains, birds and animals and told us about Ladakhi culture, history and great stories of his mountaineering expeditions. He was an extremely patient and kind guide, always smiling and making us feel like we had really achieved something when we got to the top of the passes (even though he could easily stroll up!). We were also very comforted by his thorough knowledge and experience of the symptoms and prevention of AMS.   The quality of the food on the trek was also outstanding. Stanzin amazed us daily with his creations.",Alyssa111,/Profile/Alyssa111,"London, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"I sent 12 days with Dreamland Trek and Tour with my three children aged 12, 15 and 16. We had an outstanding holiday and were looked after extremely well. We did a package involving trekking (Markha Valley), white-water rafting, biking and sight seeing.Great company with good fun people who knew their jobs.",Rowan S,/Profile/rowans901,,50
ladakh,Decent economical accommodation for those who rent a room just to sleep. Not ideal for stay with family. This is a very old hotel and is suitable for travellers and businessman  who only  need accommodation to sleep and decent food.,Varanasi77,/Profile/Varanasi77,Secunderabad,30
ladakh,"During one of our frequented trips to Leh, as it was always an habit to hang around the fort road, we just decided to try out Dreamland. As a freelancer, I like to design customised tour plans for avid travellers. So food, stay and activity are key components. We found the menu card of Dreamland interesting and immediately felt that gastronomically we sure are going to get satisfied. We tried there day's speciality dishes which were all continental. the dishes contained mushroom, cheese and lamb.",amyvenks,/Profile/amyvenks,"Mathura, India",40

ladakh,"My wife and I did not stay at the hotel, but we did use the Dreamland Trek and Tour for an amazing adventure in Ladakh.  We did the 8 day Markha Valley tour that was a great experience and well worth the price.  One of the reasons I would recommend Dreamland for a trek is because dealing with the owner, Mr. Javed, was easy, straightforward and everything he said was delivered.  Our guide Meddi was wonderful and led us through two mountain passes with high spirits.  Our cook Passang made breakfast, lunch and dinner every day that never got old or boring.  And lastly, the ponyman in charge of the pack horses was unforgettable. Overall we had a wonderful experience trekking through the Markha Valley and Dreamland made it all happen without a problem.  In fact, my wife has a food",Rugbyrules05,/Profile/Rugbyrules05,"Seattle, Washington",50
ladakh,"i stayed there in month of June 2015 for two nights with friends.  Hotel was economy and suited my budget. over all experience was not that bad but two things made my stay awe full. 1- Bathrooms were in bad shape, no toilet paper OR spray jets with Commode .  2- they spoiled my two favorite  T-Shirts in laundry. They bullied and eroded the colors.  this may be my perception but I will not recommend anyone to stay here.",akkibaba,/Profile/akkiyadav,India,10
ladakh,"We stayed there for two days after cycling from Manali to Leh. Hotel provides all basic needs at very reasonable rate. The  hotel is located in heart of the city, has very beautiful small garden with apple and apricot trees and many beautiful flowers. For us it was luxury after staying at ill equiped dhabas on Manali-Leh route.",SharadGor,/Profile/SharadGor,Bhuj,40

ladakh,"Choosing Dreamland Trek and Tour and Arriving in Leh - My husband and I did not stay at Dreamland Hotel but selected Dreamland Trek and Tour to hike the Markha Valley because of its well-organized and appealing website; because of the positive reviews; and because of the concerns expressed for the environment and for sustainable tourism on the website. We did not regret our choice. It was a pleasure to organize the trip from the USA via email with Javeed who answered efficiently all of our queries at lightening speed. Conveniently, Dreamland also ensured transportation from and to the airport in Leh. Arriving in Ladakh after crossing 10 time zones and rising 3300 meters (11,000 feet), we were happy to first acclimatize in the interesting town of Leh for 3 days.    The Trek - On",MinouBoston,/Profile/MinouBoston,Boston,50
ladakh,"We did not stay in the hotel, but Dreamland also organizes mountain treks, which they did for us.   It was extremely easy to plan this trip with Javeed, who was helpful and quick to respond. A good start to be followed up with an even more impressive trek. Our guide Pemba was just great. What an amazing man. Kind, helpful, proficient with English and a lot of knowledge of nature and the local culture. It was humbling to (try to) follow his pace up the mountains. Tenzing the cook did a great job rehydrating and reenergising us every morning (French Toast and Pancakes!), noon and evening. He also did a good job laughing at our jokes together with Tashi the courageous ponyman, the fearless freight carrier of the highlands. But this crew's greatest accomplishment was making three",Matthijs K,/Profile/MatthijsK163,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",50
ladakh,"Stayed for 5 nights at this hotel because of its location & the owner, in November 2012. Travelling alone & unplanned, I stumbled upon this place as most other places were closed & out of my budget. The owner made it clear that the accomodation will be basic, hot water will be once in a day but he will make sure that I wont get any cold during the nights. For the next 5 days he was true to his words. By the time I reached, most of Leh was closed except for the main bazaar & a few hotels in the Fort road. Dreamland's location was quite convenient. Its restaurant & cyber cafe was closed & the family was soon closing down the whole place. Rooms did not get really cold & the covers, blankets etc were clean & warm enough in the November nights.",Durgesh Singh,/Profile/DurgeshSingh,"Bhubaneswar, India",40
ladakh,"I stayed at Dream Land in the month of July'2010. The location of the hotel is good, however the condition of rooms/ Bathroom was not good, it was substandard.   The hotel has its own restaurant & Internet Cafe.  However, the garden just outside the rooms are beautiful (they also have some apple trees in the garden).",V B,/Profile/Vbhakuni,"Noida, India",30
ladakh,"The Dreamland hotel is connected to the Dreamland Trek and Tour - the hotel is a simple one. Cleanness and level of maintenance is on a poor level. 24h hot-shower is not there (we had to ask many time to get a shower within 1 hour).  Restaurant Dreamland is good - try the Tibetan Momos.   Dreamland Trek and Tour is good, we had a great trekking tour with this operator (the have some old not well maintained tents, ask for tents where the zippers work fine).  Overall - try an other hotel in Leh. Book your trekking with Dreamland Trek and Tour. Have a dinner in the Dreamland restaurant.",mcfri,/Profile/mcfri,"Zurich, Switzerland",20
