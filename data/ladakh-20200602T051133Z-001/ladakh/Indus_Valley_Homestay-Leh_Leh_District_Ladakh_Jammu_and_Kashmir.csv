ladakh,"I personally feel that if don't write review of this resort then I think it would be unjustified with the owner of the resort nicos efforts. It was just an experience of coming back to your home. Staff was good, cooperative, more specific friendly.    Food was great. Moreover, the property is at a place we're actually u can think of peace. Tents were comfortable, warm and safe. Thanks nico for ur hospitality üôè ",Gagan T,/Profile/TONI190,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"We stayed here for 3 nights and had a great experience. Its in Spituk village so not in Leh near any shops or restaraunts, but Amo the Homestay owner was always able to arrange a taxi ride to town when we needed. The property is beautiful with a nice garden, Apple and apricot trees, walking distance from the Indus River, great views of the mountains! The rooms were clean, the bed was comfy, and the food was delicious when Amo cooked dinner for us on our last night. She makes homemade paneer and butter from their cows!!! Very sweet place to stay and I hope I can go back one day",Ariana P,/Profile/811arianap,"Berkeley, California",50
