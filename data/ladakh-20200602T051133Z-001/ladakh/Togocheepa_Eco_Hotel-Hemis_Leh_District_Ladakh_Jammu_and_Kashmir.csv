ladakh,"Togocheepa is a real good hotel in this region, where you rarely find satisfactory accommodations.The first impression is a nice flower garden in front. The room was spacious (in fact it consisted of 2 rooms) and is was well furnished. The beds were comfortable. The bathroom was o.k., everything worked, also the warm shower. Our dinner was remarkably good although that day we were the only guests. The village Shukpachan is an attractive place to start hikes in the region. And don't miss to visit the old juniper forest at the end of the village ! I would like to recommend this hotel.",Review314159,/Profile/Review314159,"Karlsruhe, Germany",40

ladakh,"I was there in June for a yoga and hiking retreat and stayed in the hotel for 10 days.   I love my stay, the village where the hotel locates is beautiful and close to many beautiful hiking trails.  The staff were really attentive and I enjoyed my food there.   I was doing yoga everyday in the most beautiful yoga studio with panorama view of glaciers.  I would definitely want to come back to this hidden gem in Himalaya.  Thanks Sonam, Veerle and Rene for creating this beautiful and healing retreat!",ket l,/Profile/119ketl,,50
ladakh,"Togocheepa was perfect and beyond all my expectations. We slept with three of us in the family suite and this was such a big room with a really nice bathroom and a warm shower every day! The beds were super nice with the perfect view on the mountains from the windows! The food was so good every day and not a day the same. I also loved the staff, they were super gentle and funny! I like all the Eco parts of the hotel, like the solar panels and the water tank to fill your own bottle. Also the fact that they use so much food from close to the hotel. I loved the location of the hotel. The village is so small and nice to be there. Just to walk around and also so close to the silent valley where you can just walk through or sit on the rocks and enjoy the silence and amazing good",Yasmin,/Profile/yassiepassie,,50
