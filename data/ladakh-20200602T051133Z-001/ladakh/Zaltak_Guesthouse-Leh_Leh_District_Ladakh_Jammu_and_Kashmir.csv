ladakh,"They would not honour our booking, even when shown the booking confirmation with listed amenities and price from the booking site. They tried to talk us into a ‘nicer room’ than the one we booked for more money and we said ‘no’. Their nicer room was exactly what we booked but they were trying to charge us more for it. Then they said the room we booked at the lower price  was not available and that they didn’t know when the people in that room were checking out. They insisted that the only room was this more expensive room that we had to pay extra for. If it hadn’t been for just arriving at the high altitude with all our luggage to carry we would have left. It was not a good start and didn’t get better. This nicer room was right behind the front desk. The whole place seems to be",Tammy2124,/Profile/Tammy2124,"Vancouver, Canada",10

ladakh,"This guest house is like 2nd home away from home. The owner is so co-operative, words cant explain. The day we reached late at night, all restaurants were closed, the owner lady made special dinner only for 2 of us so that we wont sleep hungry.. Little far from main road but as we had rented bike with us, so faced no problem. There is 24hr hot water availability, also free wifi.. I will book this everytime i visit Leh..",Sarkar_2799,/Profile/Sarkar_2799,"Asansol, India",50

ladakh,"I was planning a budget trip to Leh and I wanted a stay option for 2 nights in Leh.  I laned up at Tsweng Nubroo and his property Zaltak Guest House by an FB Ladakh forum.  We( ME and Nubroo) got in touch via whats app and after talking with him, I immediately booked the rooms and paid the advance amount.  It was budget trip, so we wanted a single room for all four travel mates. Nubroo gave us 6-bed room with attached bathroom. The room was basic but clean and very comfortable. We got free wifi also.  Nubroo and his staff were very courteous and co-operative. The food was excellent. On our special request, Nubroo served it in our room.  I highly recommend this property to all kind of travellers. They have just opened a new property just next to Zaltak Guest House name Zaltak",Shreyas Macwan,/Profile/Shreeeeyas,"Anand, India",50
ladakh,"First of all, we never thought of this place as a guest house because of the lovely hospitality we got. The people were extremely kind and accommodating throughout our stay. They have a wonderful garden where they grow their vegetables and fruits which is what they use to prepare their meals, and i must say the food was delicious. The house is about 500m from the main market making it accessible for all the shopping we wanted to do.  As for the rooms, they were clean, spacious and quite comfortable throughout the day. The sunlight during the day just shines through making it naturally well lit and we were lucky to have some interesting house mates and enjoy a good conversation. One would be lucky to get wifi here because it keeps fluctuating, but that`s how Leh is anyway. ",aakashgopal22,/Profile/aakashgopal22,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",50

ladakh,"Tucked away from the main market, Zaltak Guest House is located down the winding road of lower Changspa.  A beautiful property with a homely vibe, our stay here was delightful to the very end.   The property featured a vegetable patch and flowers in the front yard, cozy rooms with balconies, clean mattresses and hot water. an apple orchard at the back with an area for a bonfire and some lovely pet animals.   The local family running the place was friendly and warm - even cooking a deliciously simple meal for us one night.   All in all, a great place to serve as the base for your trip - you can safely leave your luggage behind (at no charge!) and head out for a few nights to visit attractions close to Leh.",ArmaanVananchal,/Profile/ArmaanVananchal,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Nicest guest house with the kindest of people. Run by a local family, this place has all the amenities you need to enhance your Leh experience. From utilities, fresh farmed fruits to home food and 24 hr service, this place is a must stay.",Sakshi A,/Profile/SakshiA166,,50
ladakh,"We walked in and met Bittu, the house cat. The guest house as quite a few rooms and a beautiful vegetable garden out front. Our breakfast had some fresh apples right from the garden. The produce was amazing.   Rooms extremely clean and quite warm (which is necessary). Most importantly, running hot water 24/7 (that saved our lives).   The house lady was extremely kind and warm. She even let us borrow her car for a trip to the market in the night.  We usually ate out to try different things, but one night we asked for dinner and it was fabulous. We were served well and everyone overate.   We made a mistake and shifted to another place closer to the market for a day, and shifted back the next day.   The house lady is extremely helpful, arranged for cabs, suggested places to visit",Karan K,/Profile/KaranK725,"Ahmedabad, India",50
ladakh,"So I was pretty nervous to go to Leh because I heard it was cold, there may or may not be wifi, and forget about hot water. But this place did not disappoint, the owner is so sweet and kind. And this hotel has fully furnished rooms, with wifi access, hot hot water, and flat screen tvs with all the channels. I am so glad we stayed at this place. In fact we stayed here for one night and moved to another place the second night, but this place was so homely that we decided to come back for the rest of our nights in Leh. The owner is very sweet and will provide you with whatever it is you need. This place honestly made our entire trip.",Hira13,/Profile/Hira13,"Los Angeles, California",50
ladakh,We were 11 runners from Chennai stayed in this property for a week. One of the best stays ever for us runners. We usually travel for Marathon and stay in Hotels. In Ladakh we were told Guest houses are  good to stay and Zaltak didnt disappoint us. We were specially taken care by the House lady and helping boys from Bihar. They were ready to do that extra bit when we asked for coffee/tea as early as 4 am for us to get ready for the Run. So happy to stay there and will recommend for anyone going to Ladakh.,Chandramouli R,/Profile/ChandramouliR10,,50
