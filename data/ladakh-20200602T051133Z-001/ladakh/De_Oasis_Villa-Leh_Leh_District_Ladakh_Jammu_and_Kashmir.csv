ladakh,"Pleasent hotel..deceny rooms, decent food..very helpful staff...sadly most of the rooms have no view, inspite of large windows.. view id block by rapid construction everywhere in Leh. It is walking distance from main market, is very helpful.",Andy L,/Profile/AndyL2470,,40
ladakh,"I went there with my family.  Staff was nice and very helpful.  (They also guided us to Leh market and helped us to buy best stuff)  Rooms were clean and big, Bathrooms were also clean. They provided hot water round the clock. They also have balcony with a nice view. I felt rooms are very dim lighted. They can increase the lights within.  Food was nice, they have a buffet system, in the temperature of -1 they served us hot food. They keep tea and warm water ready.  They also have medical facility within the hotel, if someone experiece altitude sickness contact to receptionist and they will arrange medical help.  Market is nearby, you can go walking and explore LEH market. There are good cafe's and hotel in the Leh Market.   you can ask for extra blanket is you feel cold.

ladakh,"Was on visit to Leh fm 21-25 Sep. City witnessed it's first snowfall of the year and it was bone-chilling cold out there. Unfortunately on first day of visit met with an accident at late night and broke entrance glass and forehead too. My wife was very much scared seeing me bleeding. Owner and all staff rushed to the place and gave first aid and took to hospital very quickly, got 4 stitches on forehead. The efforts put by all were really praiseworthy. Great hospitality and Kind gesture.. Thanku team Oasis..",Tour819002,/Profile/Tour819002,,50
ladakh,"We were in the month of August stayed in oasis villa for 3 nights. The hotel is well located near market , leh palace. The entrance garden is well maintained for your warm welcome. The rooms are big and clean. The service staff is too good. At reception mrs Chrol, the lady is too co operative and sincere taking efforts to make stay comfort.",Mhemant,/Profile/Mhemant,"Neral, India",50
ladakh,When i was planning for leh I had numerous options for stay. Me and my friend decided to stay here and we are damn right. It's a gorgeous place to stay. Everything is perfect. It's only 5 min walks to the market. Staff is well mannered. The manager chorol is overwhelming. She is very cute. Food is top notch. I also get some time to spend with the owner Amchuk. He is the most generous man I met in leh. He made everything simple for us from getting cabs to permits. He also told me about the local delicacies and local restaurant which are too good. Thanks Chorol and Amchuk. ,Amit T,/Profile/936amitt,,50
ladakh,"We were impressed by the nice garden in front of the hotel, however that was one of the only good features of the hotel.  Most of the rooms are very stuffy with very poor wind circulation. The hotel is not  well kept as one of rooms had a broken toilet (room 101)  and  another had no working lights in the toilet and broken floorboards as well as water damage on various walls throughout the hotel.   The service  by most of the staff was okay but the front desk manager was very helpful. I would recommend getting help from the manger rather then asking the staff for help.  The food quality was average as nearly all the food tasted similar, which was very surprising. However, the Indian-Chinese food served was much better.It would be worth giving the chilly potato a try.",Atish B,/Profile/951atishb,,20
ladakh,We were on a tour and had the misfortune of staying in this dump for three nightmare nights. No toilet paper in room on arrival. Nowhere to hang anything. No hot water on our last day. Shower head fell off. Dirty sheets with holes in. Dirty grey towels. WIFI only in reception area and good luck with it - absolutely useless. Vegetarian food only. Staff useless - had to ask for things multiple times (kept forgetting). Be prepared to get woken at 3:40am every morning with call to prayer from nearby mosque.  Do not spend your hard earned cash here. ,Neil F,/Profile/723neilf,"Sydney, Australia",10
ladakh,We stayed at the Oasis Villa Hotel for 7 days. The hotel premises is spacious and the rooms are very comfortable. The view from the hotel is breathtaking  especially the snow covered peaks and the Leh Palace. Proximity to the market is very convenient as one can just walk down to the main bazaar for shopping. However being close to the market place does not disturb the peace and quiet of the hotel. The hotel staff was very warm and quick in their service. The food served at the hotel was sumptuous and delicious with a different menu everyday. The owner Mr. Angchuk was most kind and courteous making our stay at the hotel a very memorable one. Will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and relatives. Also looking forward to visit this place again the next year.,Mohan S,/Profile/MohanS973,,50
ladakh,"perfect place with most courteous owner and staff who went out of the way to help us ... they serve delicious food and rooms are huge, clean and with amazing view ... best part they serve organic food ... thank you for making our trip memorable ",rishsethia,/Profile/rishsethia,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"We stayed here before and after our trekking in the mountains near Leh.  Hotel itself is nice with a lovely garden (and construction of more rooms also btw). We had our room above the lobby with a balcony with nice view towards the mountains and little part of Leh Palace. Room itself was of good size as was the bathroom. Breakfast wasn't too fancy so after one day we went for breakfast in the city itself.  Wifi was pretty slow. Location was good, just a few minutes away from main bazaar, bakeries, shops and restaurant. Leh Palaca a little further away but still easy to walk to.",PatrickBuijs,/Profile/PatrickBuijs,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",40
ladakh,"Had planned to stay for three nights, but checked out within one night. The room was comfortable, however the service was below expectation: 1. Dinner: Cold chapatti served. On requesting fresh chapatti's, were served the same chapatti's reheated and were as good as pappads. 2. Morning tea requested, but never arrived. 3. No hot water in the bathroom.  4. No wifi information shared with us.",rishib80,/Profile/rishib80,"Noida, India",30
ladakh,This hotel has a great location. It is close to the city center yet is tucked away in a quite corner with a nice view of the Leh palace and snow capped mountains in the distance. The staff is very courteous and the food is pretty decent. The bathrooms have a weird design but are clean nonetheless. A pretty decent hotel overall.,HarshMankad,/Profile/HarshMankad,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,"Let me start by saying the young manager could not do enough for us. He was great.... Now-  We stayed here as part of a group of 20, and although we loved it the first day, soon noticed a few odd things.  Only some of the showers worked properley. Some of our party were meant to get water into a large bucket and sponge themselves as their shower didnt work. We were told we could store drinks in their Fridge, located in theEating area. Only to find drinks missing the following day. I placed some boots out in the sun to dry, and they went missing. Find out a member of staff has taken them to his room, because I said he could have them (erm, no. no, I didnt). Finally, a member of our party left a Sari in a bag on a chair in the foyer.  When we get back to Australia, and notice Sari",OzDrew,/Profile/OzDrew,"Goulburn, Australia",20
ladakh,"As per our itinerary we were to stay here for 1 night. But we were here for for 3nights. Homely Food and the nice staff of hotel will make you feel great. Hot water, bed tea and bonfire is great as well. ",chukhu,/Profile/chukhu,Itanagar,50
ladakh,As a solo female staying at this hotel I would highly recommend this place for people looking for homely stay in the heart of the city. What this place lacks in glitter they make up with good customer service. The rooms are quite big and the one i stayed had great views. The owner is quite involved in the running of the hotel and every one seems eager to help. This is not a pish posh place but a very nice for anyone wanting a relaxed and homely getaway.  The one problem I had was that the place switches off their wifi at night and also the reach of the wifi is only near the lobby. That was inconvenient,glutton4_travel,/Profile/glutton4_travel,Singapore,40
ladakh,Stayed in the hotel for 5 days.Very good hotel with extremely good service.Every body is very eager to help. Rooms are big and clean.Our room had a balcony with view of Leh palace.Five minutes walking  distance from market.Food is Ok. Will definitely recommend for stay in this hotel,PARTHA H,/Profile/PARTHAH,"Kolkata, India",50
ladakh,Average decor but staff very helpful.  Managed by a family who stays there only. The family was quite helpful.  You felt like you are at your home.  Only disappointing was MONOTONOUS food for 7-8 days in particular the dinner,Ashish Shah,/Profile/tbmAshish,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",30
ladakh,stayed in Oasis and had a lovely experience. Its well maintained property with backups and wifi. the rooms are nice and big with great views. the walk from main market to hotel is not much. The owner and caretakers are nice too. perfect for relaxed and comfortable stays,Bass T,/Profile/736basst,Pune,50
ladakh,"We reached Leh on the 01st of September with the weather posing a threat for our vacation. We checked out a couple of hotels and then in the end hit upon Oasis Villa. From the moment we stepped in, we had a feeling that this would be the best place to stay and tell you what, with each day, we fell in love with this hotel more and more. I liked everything about the hotel - the location, the rooms, the general ambience, the service by the caretakers, the always smiling and ready to oblige owners Mr. Angchuk and his wife and so on. I would definitely make it a top to stay there for my future visits too. I would highly recommend this hotel for all kinds of travellers like couples, family, friends etc.",narayan h,/Profile/narayan74in,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Stayed in the first week of july, the rooms are clean and basic. However what shines through is the warmth of the staff there.. A nice sitting place in the garden where you can have a view of the Namgyal peak while you sip your coffee.  I ahd a few good reads while my dog went around sniffing gleefully in the large open space they have in front ... yes sir it is pet friendly.. It is close to Changspa where all the action in the evening take place",shailkhanna,/Profile/shailkhanna,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
ladakh,My husband and me was there in June last week for 4 days. It was awesome to stay there. The hotel just near to market and views were beautiful. Rooms are quite good ans all the stuffs are nice and helpful. Love to visit again.,sumana086,/Profile/sumana086,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,"We stayed at the Villa in the first week of July 2014. Amchek and his extremely warm family run this place and we couldn't have chosen a better place considering we were travelling with our Lab dog and Villa is a pet friendly hotel. Its a huge property (with a vegetable garden too ) which helped in taking our dog out, sitting by in the evenings while our dog sniffed around. At the same time, it is walking distance to Changspa and the main market area so wonderfully located too. The staff was exceedingly helpful and courteous. The food was simple and good. The rooms, of course, while not exactly as per the photos, were utilitarian and clean yet with a view of the beautiful mountains which was all we wanted. Overall, excellent place to stay in Leh.",PoojaY,/Profile/PoojaY,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",50
ladakh,"I wouldn't say it was a bad stay. However, this hotel has huge potential to be one the best in Leh. Few observations: All rooms are not equally maintained. There are old rooms which somewtime smell of smoke or moist. However the new rooms are good. You'll have the option to get breakfast in a nice vegetable garden in front of Hotel...However, the breakfast was almost same everyday. They provided unlimited tea coffee...however food served was cold sometime. The staff and owner...all were friendly. However the no. of staves were less and you hardly get anybody when you need them.  Overall...this hotel has huge potential to be a better hotel. All they lack is better service...",amarstays,/Profile/amarstays,"Bangalore District, India",30
ladakh,"We stayed here for 8 days ...and the place becomes like home, it is not a hotel ( for those who prefer room service and restraunts). It is a place with a lovely vegetable garden, a great view of the mountains, palace and the monastery and to find all of this in just 5 minutes walk from the main bazaar and fort road all make this a great homestay. It is just off Changspa road close to all the restaurants, this helped as we ate only Breakfast here, we stepped out for everything else or asked the staff to run an errand.  They are short on staff towards the end of the season but as the owners (Mr Anchuk) stay in the same place, you can always reach out to them. It is new property and hence is clean and i highly recommend it.",nanC29,/Profile/nanC29,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,"This appeared to be quiet a new hotel as the rooms were modern and spacious with nice furniture, balconies and good bathrooms.  They were a bit short on staff when we were there so it was hard to get service when needed and the restaurant was closed.  However, it's a quiet place just a few minutes walk from Changspa road so the location is good.  Hot water is available only in the evenings although they'll turn it on for you if requested.  Wifi is available but as the Internet connection in Leh is almost always down, it's of little use.  The rooms come with LCD TVs with loads of satellite channels.",owl_428,/Profile/owl_428,London,40
ladakh,"It was a blessing in disguise with the kind of hospitality provided post our experience in Srinagar house boat. Warm hosts, Fresh vegetables, and almost neat rooms just changed the trip experience. Close to the market and located with best of the views of Ladakh mountains.

ladakh,"Nice garden, big room and very kind service. The view is fantastic and the room are not very expensive. Very good place ! And the owner can have some good price for the jeep if you ask.

ladakh,"I just spent 5 days/nights in Leh and spent all of them at de Oasis...great stay all-around! Friendly and helpful staff, friendly owner...great location, beautiful garden with a great view. You feel like you are far away from the traffic and noise of town, yet just a 3 minute walk from the heart of Leh! I'd definitely recommend De Oasis to anyone planning to visit Leh.",Ted66_10,/Profile/Ted66_10,"Seoul, South Korea",50
