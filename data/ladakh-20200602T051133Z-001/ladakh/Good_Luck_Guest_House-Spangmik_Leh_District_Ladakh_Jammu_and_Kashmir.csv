ladakh,Horrible experience overall. This hotel has only 5 tents but lets consumers believe there are more. So when you reach this hotel there wonâ€™t be any place to stay.  We booked 2 tents through expedia.com. In the evening we were having a chat in one of the rooms when we noticed some other group entered our tent without permission and thrown away our luggage. It was raining.they said hotel members advised them to do so.all hotel members were heavily drunk. Then instead of apologising hotel members ganged up on our family and said it is a no big deal and these kind of things can happen.  I have been traveling all my life but I have never faced such horrible hospitality.  STAY AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE.  Even the location is bad compared to all other hotels nearby,Ayan C,/Profile/ayanc339,,10
