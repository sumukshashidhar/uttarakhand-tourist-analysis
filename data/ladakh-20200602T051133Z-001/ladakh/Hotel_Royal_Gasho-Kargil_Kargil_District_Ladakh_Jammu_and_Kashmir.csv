ladakh,"We had booked 2 rooms in September for one night thru our tour agent. The room and bathroom were clean. The room had fan so it was bit relief for me:-). The food was ok, tables in the dining hall were not clean. The breakfast was also ok. We got hot drinking water in the room. Room service was good. Wifi worked only in the lobby at ground floor, not in the room. Our room was on first floor facing the road, the view was good. Overall it was a good stay.",SwetaTamse,/Profile/SwetaTamse,,30

They have wifi, but it wasn't working during our visit. Dinner was good. Excellent food. But during breakfast, we had to face very unpleasant stench in the dining hall. Was smelling like some open sewer.",Subodh,/Profile/subodhsamyak,"New Delhi, India",30
ladakh,"We stayed for a night at Royal Gasho on 14th Aug, on way to Leh from Srinagar, while on our motorcycle tour of Ladakh.  We were a group of 11 riders + our crew. The stay at the hotel was comfortable. Rooms were clean, spacious and well lit and ventilated. The room had continuous hot water.  The staff at the hotel were helpful. The food served though limited options and basic was tasty.  Good place to stay if you are taking a break in Kargil on way to Leh.",VJ1974,/Profile/VJ892147,India,40
ladakh,"The room was clean and that was about all. The food below any acceptable standard,  the restaurant as dirty as it wasn't cleaned for weeks and the staff couldn't care less if you are there or not.

ladakh,"Stayed here for a night while travelling from Leh to Srinagar with friends all of us were couples. The rooms were big and comfortable and one can opt to stay here if you are travelling to Leh or Srinagar as plan for the night halt in Kargil.

ladakh,Most of the hotels in Kargil are for a pit stop on way to Leh from Srinagar. It’s a small town with no sightseeing . The war memorial is at Dras. Hotel is located at the city centre. The room was descent with basic amenities. The food is standard. At the breakfast a large travel group was with us and the staff was not capable to cater to so many people at the same time. On the whole the stay was OK. ,Gouri Gore,/Profile/GouriGore,"Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,"The place Kargil is a small township. There are very limited resources due to hilly area and remote access.  The Hotel is good enough for night stay during journey from Srinagar to Leh. Food in the Hotel is horrible. However, you do not have much options and have to depend on the Hotel food.",Anand J,/Profile/388anandj,,30
ladakh,Stayed here for 2 nights and went back satisfied.  Pros:  *good food *quick service *24*7 running water *24*7 electricity   The staff & manager are very friendly. You can ask them for cabs / sightseeing help anytime.   Good parking space for the vehicles is a add on for all  the people travelling to Kargil  for their roadtrips.,RohitKhattar,/Profile/RohitKhattar,"Delhi, Delhi, India",50
ladakh,The hotel is situated near the Indus River on the Kargil Srinagar main road. The property won’t offer you great views from all the rooms. Do opt out for the rooms that are just above the restaurant.  The food was good. The staff was helpful and courteous. The rooms were pretty big and clean. One can opt for this property for their stay in Kargil. ,Akash_Topdar,/Profile/Akash_Topdar,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"This hotel in probably the only one where I stay whenever I visit Ladakh region. The hotel is at a good location, is safe and very clean. The food, I will say is not that great, but one should not expect a lot from such distant/remote places in one of the most High Alerted region of Ladakh. The hotel staff are helpful and understand your basic needs and are very friendly as they do not see much of tourists visiting the place due to security issues and other known issues, so they treat every customer with utmost respect and love.",Ashwini K,/Profile/Ashwinikapoor,"Noida, India",30
ladakh,We were a group of ten that stayed in the hotel for a day. Nice hotel. Food was good too. Clean rooms and hot water was available too. The only drawback was because we were a big group they didn't give us WiFi which we asked them so many times. Otherwise all was good.,Marina P,/Profile/MarinaP4622,,40
ladakh,"We stayed for a night in Kargil en route to Leh. Rooms were very neat, nice and cosy. We had opted for their dinner buffet. Glad we did as the dinner buffet was very good. It was really nice to have a such a sumptuous dinner on such a remote location :) Wonderful stay.   Just a tip:if you want to hire a taxi for local sightseeing, better approach a taxi stand directly and bargain for the taxi rates. Because, the hotel staffs quote taxi rates that are double the usual rates which is unethical and also blatant lie.  not sure about the kind of deal they have with local taxi drivers.",shubashini,/Profile/shubashini,"Singapore, Singapore",40
ladakh,"Stayed here for a night on my way to leh from Srinagar. My requirement was very basic and needed something which us value for money and Royal Gasho didn't disappoint. Great location, courteous staff. Didn't try any food so can't comment. This hotel has no AC (usually you don't need in kargil) and Wi-Fi is only in lobby area (was disappointed with this). They allowed me to make as many calls as needed back home as Vodafone wasn't working here",bhavikvc,/Profile/bhavikvc,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,Good points :  1. Excellent rooms and amenitites 2. Good service 3. Decent view from rooms  4. Good food but limited variety 5.

Wifi availability - only at reception and limited connectivity ,Tapan Mehta,/Profile/tapanmehta0812,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"I would actually give this place a 2 star, but their rooms are manageable, but not for more than just a night stay when on your way to Leh.   The food is tasteless and the staff serving it are equally dis-interested in serving you as well.   If you have other options, just go for them.",Aditya P,/Profile/689adityap,,30

ladakh,"We stayed for one night at this hotel during our trip. It is sweet little hotel with very good service. The rooms are clean, bed is comfortable and bathroom are clean. Hot water is available and food is good in taste and variety. I had twisted my ankle before reaching the hotel and hotel staff was courteous enough to give us ground floor room and provide crepe bandage and balm immediately. Though they had readied the upper floor rooms for our visit. The hotel has restaurant on first floor and there is no lift. So if you have old or sick with you, you may want to go for room service which they are sweet enough to provide. There is very basic market just Outside the hotel where you do not get any touristy stuff. You will need vehicle to reach the main market. ",Mazzanilife,/Profile/RuchiS111,,50

ladakh,Checked in for one night during our travel from Sonamarg to Leh. Finding this hotel in kargil was bit tough as kargil is a big town (i thought otherwise) and people dont know much about this hotel as its a NEW ONE. Checkin was smooth. Rooms were clean however doesn't offer much view. Wifi was not working at all working. food was good. There is a parking space in the hotel but parked my vehicle outside as there was a large group who checked in the hotel and was no space left. Will rate this as an average experience. nothing great to write about.,Mohit S,/Profile/MohitS516,"Chandigarh, India",30

ladakh,"We stayed one night in Kargil on our way from Srinagar to Leh. The hotel is quite new and the room facilities are spartan but acceptable. The restaurant offers good Indian food. The big plus is the hotel staff. We faced difficulties to communicate with our family in Europe, due to the military shutdown at this time there was no internet , and the front desk boy, without asking for money,  offered us his mobile phone and hence we successfully contact our near persons. If I will have to stay again in Kargil, I will choose definitely the Royal Gasho hotel!",George P,/Profile/Q9699VFgeorgep,Switzerland,40
ladakh,"Nobody seemed to know what Gasho meant, not even the staff. Nevertheless, a nice place for an overnight halt enroute to Leh. It is in a quiet locality in Kargil.

ladakh,"We stopped over at Kargil en-route our journey to Leh from Srinagar, after a terrible lunch experience at DRAS . This hotel is really good , with nice spacious rooms and a good adjoining restaurant.  They don't deliver food to the rooms , but each floor has a restaurant . We found the food really nice. We ordered Chilly Chicken . The portion was really heavy and tasted good as well. We ended up cancelling some of our Main course.  Everything here has a Punjabi flavor to it ....so be prepared for throwing the carb restrictions out of the window....but who's complaining ...jeez we are on a vacation !",Brahmabites,/Profile/Brahmabites,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,"We stayed here for a night. The hotel is very clean and hygienic. However, the kitchen staff manager (buffet manager) is very rude and obnoxious.

ladakh,I visited this hotel along with my family on 17th of June. We booked two rooms for 5 persons. For the 5th person they specifically promised that they would be putting an extra bed which was never put in the room. There was no wi fi. Dinner was ok. Next morning we requested for morning tea and drinking water around 6:00 a.m. which was served around 7:15a.m. that too after being reminded of our request 4 times. Breakfast was pathetic. Person who served breakfast was rude. Most horrible part was- staff member would shamelessly oogle at the ladies. We had a horrible experience at the hotel. Avoid it.,565nipunv,/Profile/565nipunv,"Chandigarh, India",10
