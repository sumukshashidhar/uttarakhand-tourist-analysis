ladakh,"the guest house is located in a peaceful location on the way to Shanti Stupa. Probably one of the best for a backpacker. I have stayed here for as long as 20 days.   There are 3 newly built rooms on the 1st floor with clean and large attached toilets. These rooms are rated 700 - 800 rs during season. Other rooms are clean 2 bedded , 3 bedded and 4 bedded rooms with shared common toilet. The bathrooms has working geysers for hot water. These rooms will cost around 400 - 600 per room to be shared by 2/3 persons. There is a single room too !!  The owner and the staff is very cooperative and also lets you keep few of your stuffs back when you leave Leh for treks and come back. There is no wifi connection but as for my last conversation with the owner, he is planning to have it soon.",Suman C,/Profile/91sumanc,,40
ladakh,"I stayed here for 5 days during Sept 2015. Its in Changspa road, good location with lotta restos nearby and most importantly a STD booth right opposite. So it really helps since Prepaid sim cards dont work in Leh.   Rooms in the new building are better. They do have Wifi and the manager is very friendly. Rooms were pretty cheap around 200-300 ( shared bathroom) , depends on the month too i guess. For single rooms with bath, rates will go up.  Cheers ! Nevin",Nevin A,/Profile/555nevina,,40
ladakh,"For 600 Rs you get a spacious dirty room with only one dirty sheet. In bathroom water was everywhere, drain was clogged, whole night (3nights) I listened to barking dogs, bikers who wanted to be heared, people talking. Wifi was working from time to time. But yes - owner was friendly, they stored you luggage while you were trekking. I preferred to stay elsewhere.",Vouhca,/Profile/Vouhca,"Postojna, Slovenia",20

ladakh,"I stayed here between the treks and tours I did during my 3 weeks in Leh. I stayed in both wings on the upper floor with private bathroom (Rs700-800). The rooms were well sized and bright with big windows . The guesthouse is very central on Changspa road.  The owner and staff were  very helpful, there was no problem storing luggage during the tours/treks and there was always a room ready for me regardless of what time of the day I arrived back. This is by no means a luxury guesthouse but is very good value for a budget, central place to stay in Leh.",rubypolka,/Profile/rubypolka,"Cork, Ireland",50
ladakh,"At Eagle, you get what you pay for. The rooms in the old wing are basic with shared bathrooms and are priced at Rs. 300-400 depending on the time of they year and your negotiation skills. The facilities on the upper floor are cleaner and the rooms are less gloomy. Typically large windows as in any place in Ladakh to allow for natural light and heating. The beds are not the most comfy, but you will be able to sleep. I found the staff to be quite kind and friendly and the location to be excellent. Eagle is bang in the middle of Changspa road right opposite Wonderland Cafe that probably serves some of the best coffee in Leh.  The guest house does laundry for a reasonable price though you are better off giving your load to Dzomsa laundry on Fort Road who charge by the kilo (Rs 90)",Ocnstr,/Profile/Ocnstr,"Mumbai, India",40
