ladakh,Worst experience! Spoiled my tour!! I booked this hotel through Oyo rooms. Me and My wife checked into this hotel on 23Sep midnight around 11.55PM(we were late as we stuck beacuse of snowfall on our way) When we checked in into our room there are 4-5 boys having alcohol and cigarettes in open lobby area and our room was just attached to lobby.  We avoided this part and moved to hotel room. Once we entered into the room it was all smell of smoke. However we ignored this part as we came to hotel after long tiring day. Now the problem starts when we saw the blankets which was so thin that we could never survive in a chilling weather of leh ladakh. I requested their owner named Azgar(name provided by him) for blankets then he started arguing with me that what do you expect in 1400Rs,Road821566,/Profile/Road821566,,10

ladakh,"This is one of the 4 hotels of the Himalaya group which is situated within the same complex.  Situated just adjacent to the flagship property ""The Grand Himalaya"". Was told by the staff that it was originally intended to be a villa for the owners but now turned into a mid range hotel.  Pros: Large room. Neat washroom. Basic stuff. No hanky Panky. Good for pit stops.   Cons: No room service except for snacks. For meals you have to compulsorily walk into the restaurant of The Grand Himalaya. Not that we were complaining as the food was very nice there and the service of the restaurant staff was also very good.  Overall a happy experience and worth a try if you are looking for a budget place to stay with family.",LuxuryTraveller3579,/Profile/LuxuryTraveller3579,"Ahmedabad, India",30

ladakh,"The hotel is located close to Leh Bazar and is just about 15 minutes drive from the airport. The property is good, but the attitude of the staff and the maintenance leaves a lot to be desired. The rooms are not very spacious, but okay for two people. Though the hotel assured us of 24-hour hot water supply, such was not the case. We had to repeatedly remind them to turn on the hot water and the manager at the desk kept arguing the water was available. The taste of the food is also not up to the mark, and the unfriendly attitude of the staff is a big let downer. The packed breakfast included only jam bread and a few biscuits, which was surprising. How can anyone have biscuits for breakfast? Since we had visited with a group, and the hotels were pre-booked, there was no option for",Alokananda,/Profile/Alokananda,"Kolkata, India",20
ladakh,"I stayed at hotel himalaya in May 15 on holiday. Hotel is good. I got a very good deal on suit for my family, after talking directly to the hotel owner cum manager.  Breakfast and dinner were good. Room facilties are excellent.  There are total 4 hotels in same complex managed by same family but with different star ratings. This may be 2-3 star hotel. Services were excellent though most of the staff is from plains.  Rooms in the front and on 2 or 3 floor may be opted as they give good view of sniw clad mountains. Overall the stay was quite comfortable abd affordable. ",pathak007,/Profile/pathak007,"Port Blair, India",40
ladakh,"We stayed at the Hotel Himalaya for three nights before starting a trek in the Markha Valley.  Our room was very large with a king bed and nice view of the city and palace.  Some of the hotel staff did not speak English very well, but this did not create any issues as the hotel manager, Kushal, spoke English very well and made sure to instruct the other staff as to our needs.  Overall the hotel was nice and our daily rate included breakfast every morning.  Although for a few thousand rupees more, the Grand Himalaya Hotel next door is worth the price for the upgrade in facilities.  But if you are in a budget and want comfort, Hotel Himalaya is the place to go.  I would have given this hotel a five rating but compared to the Grand Himalaya, sister property, it ranks as a 4.
