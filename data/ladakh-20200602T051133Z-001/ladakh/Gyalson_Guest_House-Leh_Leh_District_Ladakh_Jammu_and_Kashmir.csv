ladakh,"I stayed at Gyalson Guest House for over a week. It is located at Changspa Road, about ten minutes from the main market. The guest house is just a short walk from Shanti Stupa.The family is friendly, but their English isn't that great. You may want to check a travel agency at the market if you want to organize a cab transfer.  The room was spacious, the bathroom clean. As seems to be common in Leh, the room has a carpet which didn't seem to be overly vacuumed, not outright dirty, but people with allergies might want to keep that in mind. A plus however is that all rooms on the first floor seem to have access to the balcony. I never quite figured out how the food/ooking option works - and that is mainly down to the lack of English. I was offered fantastic tea a couple times",miriamsson,/Profile/miriamsson,"Munich, Germany",30
ladakh,"We stayed for three weeks, super clean, large bathroom, balcony, mountain views, lovely and chilled family, rooms get the sun during the day and we had a heater at night for which we paid extra. Wi fi speed not bad for Leh. It’s about ten minutes walk from the main bazaar. I would definitely return! ",Miranda F,/Profile/mirandaf245,"Brisbane, Queensland, Australia",50
ladakh,We stayed here before going on a trek and it was like coming home when we returned.  They kindly looked after our bags for us whilst we were away.  The garden is fantastic.  Rooms are just what you need.,rebecca c,/Profile/rebeccacL7595LX,,50

ladakh,"It's a guest home situated in Changspa! For those of you who don't know changspa, it's the youth hub of leh town. Everything is soo pretty and peaceful with an amazing garden. The rooms are very clean as the building is new. It's run by family so it's very safe too. Just a minute walk from market and you can see the great shanti stupa and the leh palace from its window !!

ladakh,I visited Leh for a week in October to see the Indian Himalayas and chose to stay at Gyalson Guest House on Changspa Road. The family who own the place were very friendly and the guest house itself extremely clean with a pretty garden at the front. I had an excellent enjoy suite room with a lovely balcony overlooking the front with a perfect view of Shanti Stupa at the top of the hill.  The bazaar in town was only a 5 minute walk so the location was perfect. Would highly recommend people to stay here.,PottleR,/Profile/PottleR,"Horsham, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"We stayed there for 8 days and can say that this is a very nice place to be. They have very clean rooms and bathrooms, the family is very friendly and Pali is always willing to help you with anything you need with a huge smile (well the hole family too). The house has a nice garden in the front so you can seat there in the afternoon and enjoy the son while reading.   Also the place is really quiet so no worries about noises during the day or night.  And they have washing facilities a very good prices and food on demand.   This is definitely the place to stay while in Leh.",Celia Lndvrd,/Profile/702celial,"Tegucigalpa, Honduras",50
ladakh,Absolutely one of the best places I've stayed in India. The owners are amazing and the environment so homely and peaceful. We felt like home when staying there.

ladakh,"Traveling on a budget but having high standards for clean places, I have been to maybe 15 guesthouses in Leh in search of where to stay, Gylson is just the best one! It is super clean (looks new) and they actually change the sheets and clean the rooms between guests. The guesthouse offers some shared toilet-shower rooms (which are super clean and have a great hot shower) if you want to stay at a lower budget. Its located at a very central point in Changspa, Leh and the homeowners are super friendly!",shir k,/Profile/shirk26,,50
ladakh,"stayed at Gyalson guest house for 3 days, the tibetan owner are very helpful and friendly.  Good location with walking distance to leh market, restaurant and shanti stupa. Loved the atmosphere, just feel very relaxing like your own house.  they have a very lovely garden and a fatty cute cat. highly recommended guset house at Leh.",Swee8685,/Profile/Swee8685,,50
ladakh,I along with my 4 friends stayed here for 3 days when I was on a trip to leh and its surrounding. The hosts are very welcoming and the location of this hotel is very good. The food is served well and the sitting area is very nice. The leh market is about 15 min by walk and while going to market from here there are many shops which a traveller can visit for any local souvenir and buy kashmiri dress. The view of leh and the towering mountains is very nice and shanti stupa is also visible from roof top.,161adityab,/Profile/161adityab,,50
ladakh,"Gyalson is located in a great location on Changspa Rd, very close to lots of great restaurants (Wonderland restaurant is basically next door). The rooms are spacious, clean and the bathroom very modern with great shower. My bed was really comfortable. There is a beautiful garden out front with little umbrellas and chairs. The family that runs this place are really friendly and welcoming. I had an upstairs room with nice view and even though the place is very centrally located, it's very quiet (apart from the occasional dog bark that you get all through Leh!). I would definitely stay here again.",Annie D,/Profile/354annied,,50
ladakh,"Gyalson guest house is right behind WONDERLAND restaurant.  A great place owned by a Tibeten family, they are very very nice and welcoming. the rooms are all new and beautiful, kinda look like hotel rooms even.  this is where I had the best shower in all of India, always hot water :) it was great :)",diana899,/Profile/diana899,"Tel Aviv, Israel",50
