ladakh,"The facilities at resort are very nice. Very helpful staff, perfect logistics arrangement from day of booking to checkout.   But food was very bad. The offer a lot of variety but except South Indian food no other dish whether it was dessert or starter or main course tasted nice. Even food items like Dal which one gets everywhere in India- there was no taste.  Also if one goes to Leh, the best part is local culture , market place , local cuisine so there is no point in staying in this resort.  The resort offers no activities in the resort. One feels more sick while getting acclimatising while being in this resort. While being in city, one gets adjusted easily as there are so many local shops, food joints etc.  We stayed at both the places in this resort and in the Leh city.

Staff is extremely courteous, and whatever limited Veg options they have in there food menu is good.   However, I found the rooms to be very uncomfortable and we had to change our room after 1-night stay as well due to bad bed quality.  The rooms are built extremely airtight, I think due to Ladakh Extreme winter but they forgot that they keep the hotel open during Leh Summers as well where temperatures during the day time are 22-24 degree. In that weather sitting in an airtight room without any ventilation/fan is extremely uncomfortable. Even there is no ventilation in bathrooms. So overall they take a luxury price but the rooms don't match that price in quality.  Would definitely not",Tushar Goel,/Profile/goeltushar23,"Bengaluru, India",20

Must vists are thousand year old Alchi and may be one more like Diskit. Similarly, visiting one or two passes like Khardunga pass at 16380' high from the sea level is good enough. If you love trekking, plan for a couple of days. Must visit Pangong lake. Ladakh Sarai has properties almost at all the must visit places but their property at Pangong lake is not worth staying.

The huts are nice and cozy. We were lucky to get Hut No.6 which i guess along with Hut No.5, has the best view of the mountains.The place is about 4-5 kms from Leh market which keeps us away from the hustle and bustle of the town. The food is wholesome and healthy. The service is prompt and the needs of the guests are well taken care of. The team led by Rimzin is very efficient even though they do not have any professional training which is probably why they take care of their guests with warmth that we do not get to witness in 5 star",Pushyam_Kiran,/Profile/Pushyam_Kiran,Hyderabad,50

You will be pleasantly surprised (unless you are obsessed with traditional five-star accommodation).  A special mention once again to the wonderful service. It'll put any 5-star service to shame, period! Cheerful and genuinely caring people who are always there 24/7 at your service. Food was another high point. The cuisines they serve really amazed us.

This alone is reason enough to stay here ...  regardless of any other issue. Hope this continues for all future visitors.  And we now truly understand why the reviews have been consistently great.

There is no need to stay need the central part of town in Leh since there are taxi arrangements to take you there in 10 mins. They make excellent travel arrangements as well.

I was very impressed by the whole experience. The staff are lovely people, the Sarai is a very special place, and frankly, the Sarai is the best option in Ladakh. That said, there can be a few improvements: the tents could be spruced up a bit....perhaps less flat screens and more tibetan crafts? The food could be a bit better. (No offence.) I say this if the Sarai wants to compete in the future.

ladakh,"Decided on Ladakh Sarai after a lot of consideration, going by the reviews and photos in different sites. In the end, it paid off - the stay was totally to our liking and then some more. The details were meticulous taken care of - from the airport pickup to the travel arrangements and acclimatization. Mr. Rigzin does not have a fixed plan for everyone; so his suggestions are based on the purpose of your trip. We preferred to take it easy and relax during our stay, and he made adjustments accordingly.   The accommodation is unique - camp-like and spaced out, so you do not feel like being in a hotel. Something very important given the landscape - it really makes it an amazing experience. The in-room heaters (Bukharis) and the hot water bags ensure the comfort.

The concept of living in tents (which were totally insulated) was fantastic.  The staff was ever responsive and enthusiastic.  The cuisine was always a pleasant surprise and the spread was wide. We totally enjoyed the the 'bukharis' and hot water bags provided in the rooms to provide warmth.    My children had a great time playing in the open areas and were pampered by all the staff.  The hotel provided us with an Innova with a fantastic driver.  The itinerary planned by the hotel was quite all-encompassing.  The stay at the affiliated camps at Alchi, Nubra Valley and Pangong tso lake was great fun.

Truly, we found not one thing to complain about.  The staff is very friendly, helpful and cheerful and the cook Mr. Khan is superb.  Mr. Rigzin treats all guests as his family friends, and finds it hard/impossible to charge people for services!  :)   For people like me from Mumbai, this was most strange and unexpected because we are so used to being overcharged for every little thing!   I think Mr. Rigzin needs to be more ""commercial"" minded.

No, everything about Sarai is different. You sleep in Yurts (they do have proper bathrooms & showers attached, as well as satellite tv & flatscreens, so rustic...but not too rustic).

ladakh,Ladakh Sarai with its yurt style rooms is a fairly unique experience in Leh.  The main things I remember is how peaceful and relaxed it was and how incredibly helpful all the staff were.  When I had trouble contacting my bank they went out of their way to help me sort it out. Its a great place to meet fellow travellers as you sit down to a communal evening meal in the traditional style dining room. The staff are always on hand to make tea and generally help you out if needed.  The food was good but fairly heavy.  The room is very comfortable but obviously you have to get used to the rationing of power and hot water that is par for the course in Leh and good for the soul.
