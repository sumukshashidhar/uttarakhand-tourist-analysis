ladakh,"When we go on a vacation, our basic needs of good food and good hotel ambience should be fulfilled. But this hotel has horrible food quality, extensions are not working. Not a good place to stay. Whatever you ask is not available with them eg. Poha. When we asked the waiter for Honey Ginger Lemon tea, he said no ginger is available and even no tea bags are also available. Bread butter was awful.",Anamika S,/Profile/887anamikas,,10
ladakh,"At first we were really impressed with the Photos of the interiors and the Hotel which truly are very good. But, the location of the Hotel is little messy. It looks as if it's between a group of houses(that doesn't mean you feel as if you are at home). You don't feel like you are staying in a hotel if you walk around and reach the hotel. When enquired with the people there we got to know that it's just a place for the Riders. If you are going with Family, strictly it's not for you. We are group of friends, so had to adjust.    Coming to the Services, it's completely a One Man Show. One chief cook who is the receptionist, electrician, mechanic, etc, etc. Don't expect any delicacies. He tried to cook whatever we asked for but they taste awful. Breakfast and Veg Curries are below",RaghuNadhKasturi,/Profile/RaghuNadhKasturi,"Hyderabad, India",30
ladakh,"Our group stayed here for about 8 nights and 9 days. If there was an option to give 0, I would do that. I would list down the negatives first. We spotted bed bugs in our room. Kitchen was very dirty. 90% of the time there is No power and no generator too. you have to sit with candles after 6pm.  Inexperienced kids deployed in kitchen, and the same guys clean the rooms and bathroom. These kids are actually not innocent though. They dont give you the bill after your meal and will tell you that they would give you during your checkout to make it easy.  They do this to manipulate the bills.  They made manual bills, and charged different prices for the same item.  Ex:3 Boiled eggs, which we dint even order was for Rs.150. If omlete on day one is 200, 0n day 2 it is 300 and day 4 is",spoorthi s,/Profile/SpoorthiSeethamma,"Bengaluru, India",10
ladakh,"I was there in January (winters), I'm not sure about summers but in winters this is a great place to stay. I experienced my first snowfall experience from this hotel. The service here is very good. You ask for something and you get it. Although the food is costly here but since this is very near to central market, you can go there and eat your favorite food. Overall a decent place to stay. You will also get heater if you feel cold.",Sandeep Y,/Profile/206sandeepy,"Noida, India",40
