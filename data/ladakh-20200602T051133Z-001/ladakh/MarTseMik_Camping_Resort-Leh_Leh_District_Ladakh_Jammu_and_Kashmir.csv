ladakh,"the camp has both rooms and tents. Rooms are quite smaller than tents but far warmer than tents and there is no issue of rains seeping in. There are different quality tents also, the one near the rooms are far better and the one near the pangong lake is quite thin. If you are feeling cold Prefer the rooms or the tents near the room. The staff was quite friendly and helpful, but the water there was quite cold and salty. You should probably not take bath with it. Bathrooms were just ok,can't expect much from tents. The camp is situated at the start of pangong lake and is far away from 3 idiots shooting site, there is nothing between the site and other site so all items are sold at double the MRP. We were asked to pay INR 1500 for the campfire, which we did not take. Electricity is",Krishna B,/Profile/KrishnaB531,,40
ladakh,The check-in process was easy. No ID documents verified. We stayed in one of the rooms. The camp has nomadic conditions. The bed and bedding was OK. However the bed linen was not changed or cleaned after previous customers checked out. There was not much house keeping done. The dust bins were not emptied after the last customer checked out.   Toilets were another league all together. The toilet seat was wobbly. Wash basin had saline water- no sweet water as we are used too. Wash basin drainage pipe was not connected to the drain and waste water instead was flowing in the shower area.  No shower facility- common or private. You have to ask for warm water which is provided once in a day in the morning; roughly one quarter of a bucket is provided which is enough to wash your face,Uday V,/Profile/UdayV,"London, England, United Kingdom",10
ladakh,"This camp is well located along the Pangong Lake. It is one of the first properties along the lake. Nice tents with ample thick blankets for the night made for a cozy experience. Their food spread was outstanding (dinner as well as breakfast) In my entire Leh-Ladakh trip, this was the only place with such a lavish spread. The hospitality was simply warm and excellent. The camps have a nice view of the lake. They have created lot of space around the camp for a sit-out, you can play games, music, dance around the bon-fire. If you are up for an early morning trek, you can take a short trek behind the camp which will give you mesmerizing views of the Pangong lake.

The camps have toilets but no shower. They provide hot water in buckets in the morning. Electricity is available only for a limited time so schedule accordingly the charging your mobile phones.

ladakh,"Once again, excellent hospitality. The owner and his Omnipresent crew did their best to make their guests comfortable.  The tents could have been a bit higher as a 6footer needs to bend once inside the tent but your not spending hours inside standing so it’s manageable. The mess hall tent was amazingly laid out. Was very cozy and exquisitely arranged. The food was top notch. Having good warm food on a cold night definitely lifts ones spirits. The camp is located at the foot of the surrounding hills which makes short treks a possibility. If you want a bon Fire you need to book it at the reception tent.

Food gets an average rating simply because given the remote and challenging location, the cooks deserve  praise for  whatever  they come  up with. The rest is all negative. Tents are in bad condition with the main flaps not zipping up properly. Toilets could be in better condition. Hot water supply is limited to half a bucket per tent. One of our fellow travellers had stayed here earlier and said that it used to be a much better place earlier but that's not what we experienced.

Bathroom had very minimal facilities and had salt water running through the taps. I somehow managed to brush my teeth. Breakfast was served so early by 7 in the morning.

It was too cold when we reached there. the staff was offering us rooms in case we feel too cold but as we wanted to experience tent. They gave us 3 blankets in each room and also 1 extra blanket as the night fell too harsh due to cold. Trust me if you are young enough I would advise to brave the cold and stay in tents with extra number of blankets. But if you are old then would suggest to go for rooms and not the tents. They even offered us super deluxe tent for Rs.1000 per tent but as we entered the super deluxe tent there was bad smell from the attached toilets.

Here is my detailed review of the camp.  Once we reached there, the first thing was to park the car. There is enough parking space available here for around 30 cars so quite an adequate place.

We reached there when the access road was washed away and had opened after 4 days..  Surprisingly there was no shortage of supplies at the camp..  The dinner was excellent especially when the temperature was freezing.. The food was warm.. Hats off to the kitchen staff for dishing out such delicacies... To top it up the dinner tent was equipped with a Huge LED TV and Dish satellite whereby we could catch up on live Olympic Hockey match of India.

ladakh,"Before the movie 3 Idiots made Pangong Lake famous, this area was inhabited mainly by nomads living in poverty. However, after the movie thousands of tourists made their way to this jewel in the Ladakh desert and gave the nomads a source of income. And how did they make the most of this opportunity? Martsemik Camp is a perfect example of this.. Wonderful service, comfortable tents and great location. While most facilities are pretty basic, they are close to luxury if you think of how remote and secluded this location is. ",Anuj K,,"London, United Kingdom",40
ladakh,"We stayed here for a night in the 3rd week of May 2014. We had originally booked a tent, but it was very windy and cold and since we had kids with us we decided to move to a hut/room. The staff was very courteous and immediately arranged the same for us.  The place is very close to the lake, but still almost 1 KM away from the lake. The tents are arranged neatly in a row with place for a bon fire in between. The retreat is clean and well managed. The staff went out of the way to help the guests, my wife had a head ache and wanted to have some soup which the staff magically produced within 15 minutes.  The dinner arrangement was amazing considering the location we were at, the food was hot and there was a great variety of food to suit everyone.

A lovely place to enjoy the pangong lake",hormazpithawala,,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"We stayed here in Early October. Big spacious tents, with clean attached toilets - a revelation in the otherwise difficult terrain around. The tents were warm enough and enough clean blankets were provided, just in case. The staff was very helpful and dinner had good variety and tasted nice (breakfast could do with some improvement). View of the lake is limited, but then, you walk down to it quite easily. We had a look at some of the other camps around, and this surely looked the best deal.   This was surely the best camp night we must have done, except for few troubles - no bon fire in the night (apprently they had no wood) and a rodent visit in the camp in the night (though we had some packed food with us in the room, which might have attracted it).

ladakh,"When visiting a place like pangong do you really care about the place you stay at? :-)   on an honest note the camp is the first one when you hit pangong lake and is the biggest around the area. Stayed in Tent No 1, the first one in front of the lake. The tents are nice and spacious. Very clean though the bathrooms have no bathing facility.  The dinning room is very well made. Lunch and breakfast wer good for me but dinner was not that good, guess there were too many guests in the night as 18-19 tents were occupied by night. Very prompt service! must have had chai for n number of times!  The additional charm i got out of this place was a camp fire in the night which was the icing on the cake in such windy conditions! They obviously charge a minimal fee for it!  Overall a good",kushan,/Profile/kushan,"Noida, India",40

So after such a long ride, a stay at these kind of camps is much recommended. You will feel relaxed once you enter this camping area. The tents are spaciuos with attached toilet. They provided all the blankets, torches, towels. They arranged few chairs facing the lake and the arrangement was soo good.   Pros: Location:  Easily accessible, Awesome view of lakes Food : Tented dining hall was amazing. Food is also good. Very courteous staff - Very helpful.

ladakh,The camp has very lively looking Tents. The area around the tents has also been made very interesting with appropriate lighting. Unfortunately the weather was very bad the day we went to Pangong and it was cold and very very windy. We were not comfortable with the cold at all and were contemplating sleeping in the dinning tent which was the warmest there. 2 of my Friends and I did not leave the Dinning tent even after all left. seeing our predicament the owner offered us a room and the staff helped shift out stuff to the room which was a major relief for us as we really were wondering how we would beat the minus temperature there that night.

ladakh,It is situated right at pangong lake. Tents are basic and given its remote location dont expect any specific amenities. They provide hot water in bucket on request. Electricity is for just few hours. It will give you real feel of camping. Campfire starts after dinner which you will love as its weather is at chilling best. You will get great view of lake and moutains from the sitouts provided in camp where one can relax for hours admiring nature's beaty.

ladakh,"When I was planning my Leh trip, I had several questions around the camp accommodation available at Pangong, but couldn't find many first-hand reviews.....so here's mine.  To start with, there aren't too many options for stay at Pangong, just a couple of seasonal camps. They typically all open in May and close in October, depending on the snow. As one would expect at such a high altitude, environmental conditions aren't favorable, air is too thin and temperature easily drops sub-zero at night.  We booked MarTseMik camp through a travel company in Leh, you don't want to take chance of going there without confirmed booking (only to return back without a night stay...which by the way is the best part). As there isn't any place around to eat, packages typically are AP based.  The",iStrider,/Profile/iStrider,"New York City, New York",40
