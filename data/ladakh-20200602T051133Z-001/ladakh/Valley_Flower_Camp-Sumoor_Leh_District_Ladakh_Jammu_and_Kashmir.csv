ladakh,"The camp is very well organized and all the facilities are provided inside the camp. Although the camp did not had fans, but the air circulation was good. Lights are available between 7-11 PM. The food was very tasty and the staff was also very helpful. There is an outdoor arrangement of bonfire on extra charges. Overall a very good experience!!",Silky Jain,/Profile/silkyjain14,,50

ladakh,"We reached Valley Flower Camp after a long and arduous drive from Leh. It is a delightful property with well appointed tents and very helpful staff.  The location is at Sumur, some distance away from Hundar, the main touristy area, which can be a blessing or a negative factor depending upon how you look at it. Hundar is crowded, busy and very touristy. Valley Flower Camp is far removed, quiet, with little streams gurgling pat your tent, and a central area set up with a tent for groups to sit together. The location is some 25-30 kms from Hundar.  The food is simple vegetarian, with the vegetables being grown in the kitchen garden of the complex. There is a small market nearby, should you need any provisions. There is a small area of sand dunes and some tired looking double humped",Motumotu,/Profile/Motumotu,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40

ladakh,"The Valley Flower Camp hotel is a great camp style hotel at Sumoor. Though a bit distant from Nubra Valley sand dunes, it is very well maintained and managed.   The manager: Aju Thakur and his team took good care of us during our one night stay.   Though the bedroom and a small sitting area are in camp style (but very comfortable), the connected / ensuite bathroom is constructed with standard brick-mortar-tiles with hot/cold water mixers et al. The stay was very comfortable, sleep quality very secure and good.   We enjoyed dinner and breakfast at the hotel, the food being tasty and homely. Mr. Thakur and his team were very attentive and caring.   There is no WiFi connectivity and even mobile telephone connection signal is poor.  Nonetheless, the stay was very relaxing and",Prakash S,/Profile/Prakash_Subramaniam,"Pune, India",50

ladakh,"After several hours travel from Leh to Nubra Valley, to stay at Valley Flower Camp is a reward.  Tent camp is much more comfortable than my expectation plus a very good service from the manager, he even walked us around the village to show how people live. Dinner and breakfast are brilliant.  Stunning view.",Asutthida F,/Profile/asutthidaf,,50

ladakh,"The tents are reasonably comfortable with attached bathrooms to spoil you. The service was slow and lethargic, and the bathrooms could have been cleaner. The food was fine but could have been less oily. Not a great place for a couple or a small family or anyone looking for quiet and peace.",PronoyRai,/Profile/PronoyRai,"Champaign-Urbana, Illinois",30
ladakh,Property: Good well maintained property.  About 20 tents are there.  Tents: Very good tents with modern bathroom attached. No issues with cold winds.  Food: Food is tasty with many varieties. Also one can order tea/snacks anytime.  Service: Very nice.  Area: Area is surrounded by mountains with lot of trees/flowers on the property which looks beautiful.  Outside view is not very great but overall good.  Electricity: Electricity is only available for fix time. They provide emergency lights/torch in each room for night.  Cons: Only thing is it is far from Nubra valley (around 30 km) so visiting that and coming back takes time. Also it doesn't have a very beautiful surrounding as compared to Nubra Valley.,rahulasati,/Profile/rahulasati,"Belfast, United Kingdom",40
ladakh,"We checked into this property on 16th May 2016 for one night. The property was very neat and clean with trees of apple and apricot. They also had a kitchen garden which are all organic. The property has got 17 well placed tents offering a decent privacy. There is an attached toilet and bathroom with hot water option. The tents are cozy and clean. Electricity is there only between 7pm and 11pm. The dinning room is big and has a common TV with TATA SKY connection. The day we checked in, we were the only occupants in the property. The chef actually made customized lunch, dinner and breakfast. The food was really good and the stay was very comfortable.

ladakh,"Had the privilege to camp on this site in August 2015, I just loved the place. Right from the the owner of this place to the manager of this place, to the food, the service, the beauty... everything is just awesome. We were 10 of us and trust me, there was never a moment that was not enjoyed and cherished by us. Special thanks to the Manager mr.suresh who was very supportive and kind with tasty food cooked at our request. Tents are very well maintained and 5 star facilities inside. If you visit this place do enjoy the view when the electricity is gone after 11 pm. Just gather around the fire place and gaze the sky, one will be speechless with the beauty of nature sitting in the valley of flowers in Sumoor.

ladakh,"We were a group of friends travelling Nubra valley and booked a stay at this place..The service was beyond expectations. Mr.Suresh was very co-operative and made it a very pleasant stay. The tents are cozy and have very nice bathrooms, which we didn't get in most of the camps..There were lovely flowers around the camp and organic vegetables being grown around the property. The owner also gave us a tour of his farms and apple and apricot trees. I would definitely recommend a stay of at least a 2-3 days in this lovely place...

ladakh,"The Valley Flower camp is located at over 10000 feet in the nubra valley. The area around is completely flat, somewhat hard to believe after cross the Khardung La pass.  The camp is a collection of tents. Each tent has a entry area with two chairs to sit around, with window flaps that can be folded up. Then you enter the main living area with a double bed, bed side lamps. There are plug points to charge your devices during the day. At 11 pm the light goes off and you only have a solar lamp should you need a bathroom break at night. The bathroom is a permanent structure with a door. So you get flushable toilets, a basin, a shower. There is hot water for bathing in the morning. The beds are comfortable, and ok. The main dining area is a a couple of minutes walk.

ladakh,I am a foreigner living in Ladakh who chose to stay in this camp with a group of 14 friends and family who were all invited to our Nubra Valley wedding.  Valley Flower camp is without any doubt the best camp in Nubra and provides the best facilities available for such an isolated area. Me and my guests enjoyed two nights at the camp and were pleasantly surprised with the variety of food on offer during the breakfast and dinner service.  The arrangement of the on site campfire was a nice touch which all our visitors enjoyed. The great thing about this camp is the colour which greets you from arrival - many different flowers growing and no mosquitos which can be a problem in other nearby vendors. I regularly recommend to tourists and friends that they choose Valley Flower camp and,Lynnederella,/Profile/Lynnederella,,50
ladakh,"The valley flower camp is a nice accommodation in Nubra valley. We had a pleasant stay here. The tents with attached bathrooms were nice, clean and well maintained. The food is good. The staff is ok and they charge a little higher that what it is worth.
