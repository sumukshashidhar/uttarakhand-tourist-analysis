ladakh,Stayed here to acclimatize during our Ladakh bike trip. Nice place with spacious rooms. Bathrooms are also conveniently large. Situated at a distance of just 1KM from the Shanti Stupa. Leh market is also nearby (4KMs).,NileshKJha,,"Kolkata, India",40
ladakh,"Le patron est très sympathique, et arrangeant.  Chambre spacieuse, lumineuse, environnement calme.  Il est situé sur les hauteurs de leh, à pied il faut bien 20minutes pour aller au centre.  La propreté peut être amélioré. Et le prix est un peu élevé (pas de restauration possible sur place). ",julesgde,,"Lyon, France",30
