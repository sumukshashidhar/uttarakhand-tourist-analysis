ladakh,"A few days ago I came back from my trip to Leh. And all I have to say is that it was better than perfect! My vacation was planned by Veena World and owing to their customised tour package, I was able to cherish each moment of my holiday with my family in Ladakh. The place is truly magical and each spot is a must-visit. And with such an affordable package, your vacation is bound to be a lot more fun and relaxing. I only have positive feedback for Veena World and would recommend it to everyone who is planning their holiday.",Anuj Singh,/Profile/AnujKumarSharma,,50
ladakh,I have stayed at 'The Leh-Chen Boutique' with a group of 21 people from 9th July to 16th July. The hotel is clean. The rooms are big. The staff is very co-operative. The food quality is good. The walking distance from the main market road is 20 minutes.  Pros: 1) Clean and comfortable size rooms 2) Friendly and co-operative staff 3) Nice scenery view from almost all the rooms 4)  Food quality is good 5) Tata Sky Connection Cons: 1) Bad/poor WiFi connection 2) Little far from the market. (15 to 20 minutes walk) 3) Limited time for hot water  ,921suhas,/Profile/921suhas,"Pune, India",40

Food quality is good, they try to give as much variety as possible and the service is very good. The only problem in entire ladakh is your normal SIM wont work there and there are no shops around this hotel in case you want to make a phone call. There is no wifi either. It can better the experience by providing room heaters. but overall a great experience.",Manish K,/Profile/567manishk,,40

ladakh,A value for money hotel with above average service. I stayed at Leh Chen for 4 nights and was happy I took the decision. The view from the hotel is good. It is very close to Shanti Stupa and en-route to KardungLa. We had enough place to park our bikes as we were in a group of about 10 people. Food was good and the staff took care to carry it to 3rd floor as and when we ordered. The manager was co-operative too and tried to help when ever he was approached. Wi-Fi is available only in the lobby area. Breakfast is pretty decent for that location.,Sharmaaji,/Profile/Sharmaaji,"Bengaluru, India",40

I visited Leh in last week of August 2015.  Hotel Room: I stayed in room no. 312 which has the best view of the snow capped mountains. The room is very spaciours with 1 double bed and 1 single bed, which suited us since we were 3 people in a room. The bathroom is very spacious, neat and clean. The room also had a centre table with 2 comfortable couches. Still there was enough space to walk around the room.

ladakh,"We were around 30 people from the group tour organised by makemytrip in june'10, the location of the hotel is ok but service part is just poor, water & power avl. is bad & no infrastructure to manage such group tours, these tour organisers (makemytrip) compromise hotel stay in lieu of cheap bargains thus making stay of travellers hell..and most of the time there is none to listen u or attend to ur complaints..so i don't recommend this hotel to anyone..",Kansal_Chd,/Profile/Kansal_Chd,Chandigarh,20
ladakh,"Being here is like being in the headquarters of the best district in the world where you have all the 5 elements of life (Earth, Fire, Water, Air and Universe) meeting in multiple formats and giving what is called Nature at its best to humans. The hotel is in the main market of Leh which has everything in it for a backpacker like eateries, accomodation, travel information, clothing gears, bike rentals, shopping complexes, etc. Alright for food but you cannot expect much when you travel at 12000 feet.",Andybhai,/Profile/Andybhai,"Mumbai, India",40

ladakh,"We have spent about a month in Leh last summer. It was me and my spouse. We changed two different hotels before we stopped in Leh Chen. During our stay we had trekking and jeep journeys and they kept our room for free during our absence. The hotel was 2 month old, room was clean with good clean linen and clean attached bath. The view over the valley was very impressive. All the staff was very kind and the owner Terry was very helpful for jeep arrangement. We had previously organized our trekking in the Marka Valley but I strongly advice everybody who is going to trek in Ladakh to arrange it with Terry. I has a great experience as a guide too.",theoldtrekkingcouple,/Profile/theoldtrekkingcouple,"Milan, Italy",40
ladakh,"The panorama over Chanspa oasi and the castle of Leh is great! My stay at Leh-Chen Hotel was in July and August 2009. Mr. Mansoor (nicknamed Terry) , the manager, is a practical person who looked after our needs. I leaded two groups in the txo months and he helped us when two guys where ill, The hotel has begun operations just 3 months back and everything is new-the rooms, showers, etc. The rooms are spacious with attached bath. The linen is clean. You need to request that they switch on the boiler for hot water about half an hour before. We got hot water every time we requested- even 5 in the morning.",tsomoriri,/Profile/tsomoriri,Brescia,40
ladakh,"Our stay at Leh-Chen was by chance. We were staying at the Oriental and moved out after 5 days to Leh-Chen which is just a couple of buildings away.   The hotel has begun operations just 2 months back and everything is new-the rooms, showers, etc. The rooms are spacious with attached bath. The linen is clean. You need to request that they switch on the boiler for hot water about half an hour before. We got hot water every time we requested- even 5 in the morning. We also liked the open space on the first floor lobby where you can just sit and chat if in a group.  Two things we really liked about Leh-Chen was the food and service. We had difficulty finding good Indian food in Leh. But this hotel was an exception. We had hot pakoras in the evening, simple but tasty soup, dal and",sugar901,/Profile/sugar901,New Delhi,40
