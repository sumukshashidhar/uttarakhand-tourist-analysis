Tents were neat and very comfortable with beds and clean quilts which everyone would prefer, attached Western style toilet, wash basin and hot shower facility and much more.

The camp is composed of 6 tents located in a lovely garden setting. The tents are basic but very comfortable with beds, Western style toilet, wash basin and shower facilities. Heavy quilts are on the beds for when the temperature dips at night. The host and staff were warm, welcoming and were willing to accommodate any needs that were required. In front of the dining hall is an organic garden that provides some of the produce for the delicious meals cooked by the staff.

The food is amazing and beyond any expectation for such a remote place, same with the comfort of the rooms. Rigzin will find you a place, either at his camp or his sister's. He will take you around his Nubra Valley, proud of its culture, family, and never short of explanations (and a big smile) on their way of life. He took us also to the Silk Road Festival where his relatives and himself were dancing. Unforgettable experience. He was also my trekking guide around Leh and I would not have achieved my first pass above 5,000m without his encouragements. I will go back twith some friends to  do a longer trek with him!",CecileQuito,/Profile/SingaporeCec,"Quito, Ecuador",50
ladakh,"Love the place; has just 6 comfortable tents with their own vegetable garden. Its a beautiful cosy camp where staff makes you feel at home.   It can get cold in the night and there are no heaters in the room (we went in June 2016). They give you 2 thick blankets/quilts. I was feeling colder than others and wore socks after which i could sleep well.   They run hot water at fixed times. The food was delicious, they try cook using vegetables from their own garden, however in june only spinach was available. They said most of the veggies grow in july-august, so maybe if you wanna enjoy picking your own veggies and eating fresh organic food that is the time to visit! :)   The owner and remaining staff are polite and helpful.   We wish we could have stayed another night!",Shruti D,/Profile/ShrutsD,"Mumbai, India",50

The food was homely and served with love. But the show stoppers are the people who make you feel comfortable from the one who owns the camp Mr. Rigzin to the one who cooks your food.

The tents (which incorporate a separate WC and shower) are surrounded by a lovely cottage garden, on the sunny side of the valley, overlooked by Himalayan peaks.
