ladakh,"For being so centrally located, it's an oasis of peace. There are many restaurants and shops within a five minute walk from the guest house, including the main market. There's a nice garden you can sit in. Rooms are nothing special, but quite OK.",Peregrineri,/Profile/Peregrineri,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"It is a budget hotel, very close to the main bazaar of Leh city. The bed quality and room service is good. If you want to stay cheap and best with your friends then it is a guest house for you. The main bazaar of Leh is within 5 mins walk, also changspa road.",Vibhor M,/Profile/vibhorm818,,40
ladakh,"I enjoyed every moment staying at City Heart for my 20 day trip in Leh Ladakh. The location, like it is called the City Heart, is very truely convenient for walking to the market. There is even a convenient store belongs to the hotel where you can buy food, drinks, lotions and many needed stuff for traveling. Especially, the house made us feel very warm at night when we were there in Autumn season with low temperatures. Vicky who is the manager and his staff are very friendly and willing to assist us anytime we need help. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone who first time visits Leh Ladakh.",NguyenPrairie,/Profile/NguyenPrairie,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",50
