ladakh,While going from let to Srinagar we had a stay for one night in kargil.its a simple hotel.Initially the room which we got was so small that we can't even open our luggage..But then on complaining the Manager changed the room immediately..That was nice of him. Food was ok. It was located in the busy Lanes of kargil market area..so traffic can be a problem there Overall the stay was ok,Curiosity814976,/Profile/Curiosity814976,,30
ladakh,Room was very small.. We stayed for 1 night while going to Leh and that was it. Food was good... Apart from that there was no water in the early morning. had to call the staff multiple times to fix it.. Few staff were just staring and the environment there was not good.

People were shouting in other rooms, wifi was not working and the staff not pleasant. That's the quality of a bad guesthouse, but twice the price. Don't stay long!   Endroit sale (tâches sur les murs, cheveux dans les draps, rien pour vous protéger de la couverture manifestement pas propre), et cher (plus de 1200 roupies la nuit).

ladakh,"This guest house is one of many such outlets in the tiny town of Kargil, midway on the Srinagar - Leh Highway. Due to the arduous nature of the drive, most road travellers prefer to do the trip in two days with a night halt at Kargil. Hence this town has seen the mushrooming of such guest houses, to cater to this demand. This place is a low range property, slightly overpriced for the service and facilities it offers. It is just okay for sleeping for the night and a place to park the bikes. It is a very short distance from the main road, so is very peaceful, and we neither get the noise of traffic, nor that of the Indus flowing through the town.

Staff is Helping and attentive. while going back to Srinagar we had to leave at 3 in moring that time staff was awake and made tea for us and helped us to take down our luggage.  Food : Big No. There is ashiyana resto on the corner they provide better food. But Greenland made very good adrak tea.
