ladakh,"I think the best part staying here is the location, bang opposite the Pangong lake. We reached the tent from the lake by car, walking would take some time. Our tents were in the first line with a view of the lake. The tent was clean and the bathroom was also clean. The bed was comfortable with blankets. Felt bit unsafe as the tent would close only by zippers (door) at the front side, but all went well. And it was extremely cold and windy in the night and i felt the tent would fly away lol ! It was one of a kind experience. The bulb in the bathroom had no switch and it was On till late night and then switched off later. The food is very basic, do not expect much. The staff is kind and gave us a jug of hot water in tent for drinking. They gave a call to see the sunrise and again a",SwetaTamse,/Profile/SwetaTamse,,40
ladakh,"The camp is with Pangong Lake View. The tents are clean and beautiful with attached toilets. Spacious and has its own veranda in the tent. The staff give you lights for the night. Waking upto Pangong Lake view is incredible. Staff is helpful and courteous.  Flipside - No hot water supply, only 1 bucket available on request.",RoyRP,/Profile/royroyrp,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",50
ladakh,"Facing the beautiful Pangong Tso lake, amidst a sea of tents is the World Attic Camp. First in the line of a sequence of other tenting options behind it, World attic offers a decent view of the lake. Do note that the tents are good distance from the lake and driving to the lake is the fastest way to get to the it (walking can take several minutes). There is parking right by the camps. If you plan on staying here, do insist on being assigned one of the camps in the front that are away from the dining hall and parking. Unfortunately, we were assigned one of the tents right by the dining space and the parked traveller trucks and cars blocked the entire view. Not to mention the sound of vehicles moving in and out of the space was immensely disturbing. The staff is okay, the tents",Malvika B,/Profile/90malvikab,"Columbus, Ohio",30
