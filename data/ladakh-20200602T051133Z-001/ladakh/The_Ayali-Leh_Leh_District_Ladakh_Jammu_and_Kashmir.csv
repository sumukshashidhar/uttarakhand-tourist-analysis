ladakh,"I'd give this a 4.5 rating, if there was one. It's not really quite a 5, though there is a lot to recommend it. The comfortable rooms are set in a spacious property with an organic garden, though it was a little late in the season when I was there so the garden was pretty well done for the year. One special thing about the place is that it has a guest kitchen. However, it was a mess and not properly cleaned during the brief time i was there. Still, it's a good amenity. It's about a 15â€“20 minute walk from town.",Peregrineri,/Profile/Peregrineri,"New Delhi, India",50
