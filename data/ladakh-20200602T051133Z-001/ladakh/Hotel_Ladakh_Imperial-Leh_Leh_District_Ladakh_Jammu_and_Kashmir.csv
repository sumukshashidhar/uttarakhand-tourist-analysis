ladakh,"We stayed at the Ladakh Imperial as a family of 4 for 5 days. Gem of a hotel! Great location..close to the main market, however certainly not walking distance. The staff is very helpful..they make every effort to make your stay comfortable, especially Tasleem who even helped us plan our trip. Rooms are well furnished and comfy. The food was good..they were kind enough to specially prepare dishes according to our taste. All in all, we had an amazing trip! Would definitely love to visit again!",Swati A,/Profile/SwatiA318,,50

ladakh,"The hotel is on one of the main roads(not a narrow alley deep inside somewhere). Easy to step out to where ever you want to go, with lot of small shops near by in case you missed to pack something. At the same time feels serene and remote, away from all the hustle bustle. Has a large lobby furnished with fine traditional Kashmiri sofas. And there is a nice garden sit out outside,where in case you are done with all local sight seeing, can relax with a book (or a mobile) in your hand in the mild June Sun. Has a large parking as well.  Clean nice rooms. Food is good. The people (Mr.Taslim Chunka and team) are very helpful and knowledgeable. They have all the equipment standby to assess and help with altitude sickness(provided free of charge). They also helped us plan our tour(we",Sudhir Pidugu,/Profile/SudhirPidugu,"Hyderabad, India",50

ladakh,"Hotel Ladakh imperial... A home away from home. Our stay was for just 2 nights & thereafter for 1 more day in a different week.We were a group of riders on behalf of Dream Riders, a Ahmedabad based Company for our ladakh trip from Srinagar to Manali on motorcycles.   The hospitality protocol,courtesy, the environment, neatness & cleanliness & above all the Owner Mr Taslum, who just went out of way to help us in all manners, which was highly commendable. This attitude & gesture of helping is a rarity in modern times. The hotel accommodation & food quality was superb & even Jain food was available.

ladakh,I stayed in this hotel for 3 days during my trip to Leh. The hotel is situated at a very close distance to the Leh airport and the local Leh market. The staff at the hotel is extremely customer-centric and very hospitable. During our stay at no point did they make us feel that anything was lacking. Services are very prompt and a special mention goes to Mr Abhay who works as an intern there but runs the hotel as though it was his own. He made sure our stay was memorable and was always more than willing to help us out in case of any problems we faced even though they were outside the hotel.  The rooms are spacious and neat and clean. Food is always served on time and is delicious.

Apparently, it was unusually cold for that time of the year with continued snowfall and intermittent rains. We arrived as the first and only guests at this hotel for the season and hence, we believe, the place hadn't really warmed up to servicing the customers. But, they quickly caught up. So, no complaints.  Infact, the best thing about the place are the staff and the owner of the place. They are friendly and courteous and take their hospitality very seriously.
