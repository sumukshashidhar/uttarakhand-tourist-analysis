ladakh,"If its Nubra , it is Nubra Organic Retreat. An oasis of all-round greenery in an otherwise Sand-dune surrounded area. An endearing contrast of nature. The resort is completely one with nature with luxurious tents equipped with a living area , bedroom and a natural stone lined bathroom. There is an outdoor seating around every 4 tents clustered together to alllow gatherings of different groups. And the man who adds the personal touch to all this is Mr, Sharma , the premises manager. Always armed with a smile , soft words and a subtle sense of humour , he will make sure that you end up writing accolades about the services of the property after your visit.

ladakh,We were a group of 9 ladies and all of us without exception rated this as one of the best times we had at Ladakh. The property is very beautiful and well maintained. The gurgling water is the perfect lullaby. The flora and veggie garden a visual treat. No complaints about the hospitality. In the evening a bonfire was organized which was just the thing to ward off the cold. A perfect stay:),Niru64,/Profile/Niru64,"Mumbai, India",50

ladakh,"We were in Nubra valley for two nights. I loved this place! You can just relax in the tent or roam around the amazing resort. The food is great and the staff is very helpful. They even arranged a barbecue for us on the second night of our stay. They do provide wifi, but you won’t get it in the tent. Which was okay for me, but might be a downside for some people.

Food was good, and WiFi reasonable given the remote location in Ladakh. The town of Hunder is almost all given over to tourist accommodation various levels, many of which I might have stayed in in my 20's, now in my 60's a place like the Nubra Organic Retreat was perfect.

We spent a night at the tent, which reminds me about our Kenia trip... All the food which they served is coming from their garden. Very kind staff. One recommendation what we can add, is to create a yoga or meditation classes, that travellers can spend more time there, otherwise one night is more then enough.",tetyana,/Profile/tetyanapolunina,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",50

ladakh,Beautiful resort for staying in Nubra Valley. The tents were spacious and comfortable and as promised per the timings for electricity and hot water were there.   Breakfast and Dinner were part of our package and the food was excellent with plenty of choice at each meal and each item tasting wonderful especially the vegetables from the camp garden. We were lucky enough to see a cultural program at the camp site as well as enjoying the many activities available on the site.  Only drawback was the WiFi which was a bit patchy in connecting but one comes to this type of place to relax and enjoy the tranquility.   We would highly recommend and if we ever back in Nubra this will be our choice of stay.,Stephanie B,/Profile/s26sahn,,50

Lights go off at 11 but for some strange reason the lights came on at 3.30 in the night and we slept with it just waiting for it to be morning so that we run away from there.The property is very nice but due to  pathetic management &  staff it falls flat on its face.Nubra",Tiara R,/Profile/TiaraR131,,10

This is a wonderful place to stay with all amenities catered to in your strong tent amidst natural  outdoors . The food served is passable though  but there are many other relaxing ways  to spend your time here after a long journey from Leh . Would also suggest tourists to travel straight to Pangong Lake from here rather than going all the way back to Leh which only makes agents make more money while you travel . Spend that extra night here and travel to Pangong Tso direct from here .Wifi only works in dining room .

I surely wouldn't categorize the tents as luxury. I was suspicious about the linen as it had a funky smell to it. I guess it would be hard to wash it after each use given the remote location.  Hot water can also be a problem. They have a boiler but it surely isn't enough for the number of tents they have. So you'll end up with room temperature water which is okay for washing but not for bathing.   All in all, I'd say an average experience. ",asgerali,/Profile/asgerali,"Pune, India",30

Food was average, and there's not much to do at the retreat per se, but the ambience is very nice. Sunsets show beautiful colors and the early morning sky has that blue which is very hard to see in cities.  Ample open space ensured that the kids had enough to run around. Lots of trees, a machan, streams running through the retreat, all of them give a very good experience. Dinner time has campfire arrangement and can be a great place to chat with the group. Although the loud music played kind-of defeated the purpose of coming to such a place. They could also do with some more hammocks.

Our tent had no view as it was on the back side. Would recommend the tents around the organic farms as it would have a better view.

Gentle streams flowing throughout the property, organic vegetation, tree houses, tented accommodation, hammocks and apricot trees to pluck from. We stayed two nights and enjoyed early morning walks upstream through the village greeting locals and enjoying a variety of bird life. The food is a bit depressing, restricted to veggies only and not very tasty at all. The boys brought maggi noodles and got the cook to make which was considerably better.

ladakh,"Nubra valley or hunder is famour its desert like sand dunes and double humped bactrian camels. So a place like this was definetely like a mirage for me at the first sight. You are staying in a fruit orchard washed with glacial water streams and jeweled with tomato/cabbage/cauliflower farms. Pluck as many apples, apricots or walnuts from the trees around you and fall lazily on a hammock reading you favourite book and wearing 4 layers of jackets. Yes evenings during off seasons are seriously cold. But they light a camp fire to make sure you stay warm. They give you enough warm quilts as many as you ask. The tents are clean and spacious.  Water is not quite hot, its good enough for washing you face. But quite cold for a full fledged bath.

ladakh,Nubra Organic Retreat is a camp which is an ideal place to relax and unwind after a tiring journey from Leh. The hammocks which are placed strategically next to the gurgling brook passing through the camp make for a very soothing experience. The food is basic but wholesome and the staff serve you with a smile. The property is well landscaped with apple and apricot trees which were in full bloom during our visit in August and the organic garden had cabbages the size of which are to be seen to be believed !

Rich, green foliage all around and a field full of vegetables where you can pick your cabbage for dinner.
