The location is a pleasant 10 min walk from the main pedestrian shopping area, and if one doesn’t want to go and see all the wares and offered services, it is very peaceful to sit in the lovely gardens and read, write, think, daydream, or just catch your breath!

As he was alone with limited medical care  and we were miles away, I was sick with worry. However the hotel owner, a lovely lady went beyond the call of service to help my dad and was in constant contact with me regarding his state of health. She arranged for him to be taken to the hospital and had the staff stay with him and also checked on him through the night. She was responsive in answering my messages and calls.

They still keep up a flourishing garden on the property, and manifest that grace, humor and deep compassion that so many Ladakhis have.  Their property has grown into a great resource for any traveler, with clean and spacious rooms and tasty food.  It can now accommodate large groups comfortably, but is still a place to find peace and quiet.  Unlike most guest houses and hotels in Leh, the Oriental rooms have magnificent views of the valley and mountains.  It is also away from the traffic and noise of busier streets.

Pro's: 1) Nice and quite location below Shanti Stupa. Outside of the busy changzpa road and market.  2) views from the rooms are amazing with the snow clad peaks in the backdrop of the green valley. Try to get a room on a higher floor for better views. 3) staff is friendly and supportive. Right from the reception lady to the housekeeping staff. They are nice people. 4) You can get cheap rooms(INR 1000 per night) in the guest house building. These rooms don't have TV or phone. But you don't need that in Leh!  5) Food is simple and good.

Situated high up on the hill below Shanti Stupa, the better rooms afford fantastic views over the town and mountains beyond. You should however note that the tall trees that dominate planting in the area will leaf around early May, and this will have a big effect on the views - ie rooms not on top floors might loose mountain views. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from town, and this is not at all as arduous or unlit as some guides or reviews might make you think.
