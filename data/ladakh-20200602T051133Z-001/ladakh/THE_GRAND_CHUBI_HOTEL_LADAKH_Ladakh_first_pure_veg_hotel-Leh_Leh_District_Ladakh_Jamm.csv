ladakh,"The Grand Chubi Hotel in Leh is a fantastic place to stay in when visiting Ladakh. We travel as a grup of 8 people with a purpose to climb Stok Kangri and we stayed in Grand Chubi for about 10 days. From the very beginning I had an impression that we are in the right place. Very friendly owner Mr. Rigzin and his staff made our staying so comfortable and enjoyable. They were so helpful to organise whatever we need, not only our adventure to Stok Kangri but also one day trips like Monastery Safarii or raffting. He will help you with everything. Hotel itself is very comfortable, clean and nice. It has a lift. Hot water is 24 h which is very convenient. They have also their own garden with fresh vegetable, which they use to preper organic food like momo dumplings... delicious! Food",bluebird4007,/Profile/bluebird4007,"Wroclaw, Poland",50

ladakh,Hotel staff is extremely helpful. Rooms are big and spacious. But the best part is the food. Breakfast and buffet is extremely delicious. Which is unlikely in other hotels of Leh. They also arrange a local dance function on some days in the evenings.,Anushka C,/Profile/traveltales_anu,,40

ladakh,"We stayed in The Grand Chubi Hotel for three nights.  A beautiful hotel situated little bit interior of the main market.  Road is dug due to drainage work.  Hence we have to walk and enter the hotel.  Entrance of the hotel is not good as one has to climb staircase to enter the hotel.  On the right hand side of the hotel reception, one can relax and view in TV in a big sit out.  On the left hand side dining hall with all copper utensils used for the day to day food they offer.  Food is good.  Good vegetarian food was offered to us as per the itinerary.  Mornig berak fast was very good.  They offered us variety of dishes such as Aloo Paratha, Uttappam, Poori and Aloo  bhaji, Bread butter etc.  They grow  vegetable on the side of the hotel, and used for the hotel guests.  Rooms are",Jayakar BHAT,/Profile/jbhat2015,"Mangalore, India",40
ladakh,"Recently stayed here from 25th  Sep to 4th Oct and had a memorable experience. Fairly new property, spacious rooms with 24x7 hot water, great kitchen with varieties of food and extremely helpful staff. They also arranged cultural program for our Group and it was great. Location was very convenient and one could easily walk to to main market area and take a cab back if carrying heavy items. Approach road woek was going on and that caused a bit of inconvenience but I am sure once the approach road is done, it will be all fine. Hotel had its own kitchen garden with ample organic supply of vegetables.",Dalbir_S_Virdi,/Profile/Dalbir_S_Virdi,"Navi Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"This was my second visit to leh. I had a great experience during my stay there. Hotel management (mr regin ji), staff’s  service and  guidance made my trip to LEH more comfortable and memorable. Hotel is amazingly beautiful with a very soothing interior, beautiful floral garden and also a very beautiful ladhak painting with a warm hospitality. The food served was very delicious. A beautiful place to relax and makes us feel -at –home. The rooms are very classy with satanic view of Himalayan glacier, all the facilities to fulfill our needs. As a whole i had a very good time there and would surely like to visit there again and recommend my friends ,family. Requirements of leh trip it may be permits, bikes, vehicles, oxygen cylinders etc all were to our door steps. all thanx to mr",Abhishek V,/Profile/abhishekvilekar,"Srikakulam, India",50
ladakh,"I have visited Leh twice but this is the best hotel I have stayed so far. Best in terms of service, hospitality, staff, ambiance and food (vegetables grown in hotel compounds). From hotel you get the view of Leh palace and Shanti Stupa. The owner of Hotel Mr. Rigzin is the nicest person I have ever met. You just have to say and arrangements were made. Mr. Rigzin thanks for all the arrangements. Julay!!  Regards, Kalpesh",Kalpesh Raje,/Profile/KalpeshR61,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,Centrally located...the property is recently renovated...the rooms are good though a little small..(but most of the hotels in Leh are small)...the room we got was 105 with balcony shared with 106..so you could book this if you are travelling with your friends...again..view is good because of the balcony...but room 110 has a better view of mountains because of two windows facing two sides...the standouts are the beautiful artistic dining area and the delicious food......they serve you in awesome copper vessels thats super cool...also the staff is superbly humble and helpful...in fact we had a super experience with the owner who helped us with our shopping too...(PS try the butter tea which they make in front of you...also their ladakhi soup is yum..again they have organic garden,KavitaPathak,/Profile/KavitaPathak,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Grand Chubi is quite new. We stayed there for a night. This hotel is unique among Leh hotels, as ground floor is dedicated to a Ladakhi style dining hall and lobby. Bright brass/copper utensils are the major attraction. Rooms are spacious. We were in a suite, which had a nice big seating area and a big balcony. Old palace is visible from the rooms. They have a big vegetable garden. Service was good and swift. We liked the lunch and dinner. ",Subodh,/Profile/subodhsamyak,"New Delhi, India",50
