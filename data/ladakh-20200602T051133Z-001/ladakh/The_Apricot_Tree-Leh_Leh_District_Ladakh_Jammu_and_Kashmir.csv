ladakh,"Rooms in this hotel are fine, though overpriced. Dinner and breakfast were ok too, without being amazing. The hotel is indeed on the bank of the Indus River, unfortunately it's not really possible to enjoy a walk from the hotel without having to walk on the highway to Srinagar (many vehicles including dangerous trucks).",kiki,/Profile/71kiki,,30
ladakh,"A modern hotel overlooking the Indus river, we had an lovely upstairs room with balcony on the river side. Rooms were well appointed although the lack of kettle meant you had to keep asking for tea. Food was ok, buffet style and wifi (along with elsewhere in Ladakh) was patchy. A great base to explore this part of the Indus valley",Richard D,/Profile/Richard54,"Wiltshire, UK",50
ladakh,"I've been traveling to Ladakh since 1989 for work. I've stayed at a lot of hotels thereâ€”from high end, luxury places to the straightforward, rustic homestays. Recently I learned from a friend who works in Leh about the Apricot Tree in Nurla. While the location is about an hour from the airport, it is absolutely worth the drive to stay there. Nurla is gorgeous and convenient for day trips to visit Alchi, Saspol, and Lamayuru. It also is at a lower altitude than Leh so you can unwind and acclimatize in an absolutely gorgeous spot, overlooking the Indus River. Owner Wangchuk Tsering Fargo is a terrific host. He artfully balances to caring and attending to his guests while giving them space to take in the quiet beauty of his gorgeous property. Such graciousness is hard to come by",LauraKtraveling,/Profile/LauraKtraveling,,50
ladakh,"I stayed in the Apricot Tree Hotel with one of my sons for two nights and we loved every moment there. After you drive through the eerie and barren Ladakh landscape, you will find this boutique hotel in an oasis of greenery. The location overlooking the Hindus River is exceptional and you can easily go on short or long walks in the area. The decoration is elegant. The rooms are modern and very clean, and the beds are particularly comfortable. The food is excellent too, and we especially liked the lamb momos that the Chef prepared at our request. What made our stay so special was the outstanding hospitality extended by the owner and all his staff. They made us feel like special guests and family all at once. And if you are lucky enough, you will be able to have a drink and enjoy",ericf722,/Profile/ericf722,"Paris, France",50
ladakh,I stayed at Apricot Tree based on great reviews from TripAdvisor. I was not disappointed.  The hotel was nicely located next to the river. The courtyard was beautiful.

ladakh,"Our stay at The Apricot Hotel was booked through a travel agent, and so I didn't really know what to expect when I went there.   A bit of a drive from Leh, but once you get there, you're spellbound. The property is pretty isolated, with an unmatched location, right on the banks of the river Indus, with rooms looking right on top the ever-flowing river, backed by the majestic rocky Himalayas, that change colour at all times of the day with the rising and setting sun.   The place is quaint, clean, spacious, surrounded by tall apricot trees, and the food surpassed my expectations. The staff was uncommonly friendly, and we even met the owner (Wangchuk) who showed us their own patch of organic vegetables!   Make sure to climb up to the terrace in the night, to see a star spangled sky",Chantelle M,/Profile/ChantelleM346,"Mumbai, India",50

We were happy to see a gleaming black Yak being herded to higher elevation to spend the summer. This place  is filled with exotic birds, dragon flies, designed for relaxation.  a perfect retreat to enjoy lunch on your own balcony in your room.  The food is good the rooms super clean, beds with quality linen and  real boutique soaps and shampoos. The owner Mr Wangchuk Fargo is a great host with a very good staff.

ladakh,"We stayed at The Apricot Tree, after visiting Alchi Monastery. A lovely boutique hotel situated on the banks of river Indus. True to its name, it is surrounded by Apricot trees and a beautiful Ladaki architecture is strongly visible in the balconies and dining room of the property. View from the balcony is pretty as a picture post card. And they have a beautiful central courtyard with Apricot trees where you can strike a casual conversation with other fellow travelers . It was a delight to talk to Mr.Fargo, who owns this property and runs an adventure company too. They had a campfire in the night with food and drinks. We were happy to meet and share our experiences with few residents of the Hotel.  Rooms are simple and clean. They do not have heaters, but do provide hot water",Rati05,/Profile/Rathi05,"Hyderabad, India",50
ladakh,"We stayed at the Apricot Tree during our recent holiday in Ladakh. This hotel was an unexpected surprise and we were thrilled to stay there for 3 nights. The guest rooms surrounded a peaceful, central courtyard which was decorated with panoramic photos of Ladakh. Cleverly cut marble floors lined each of the walkways. Our well appointed room led out onto a verandah, decorated in traditional Ladakhi style overlooking an amazing view of the Indus River and across to a lush, vegetated bank below a picturesque, steep rocky mountainside.  Each of our meals was served in the restaurant, once again featuring captivating views across the Indus. The meals were all delicious and very generous, served by attentive, friendly staff.

ladakh,What a memorable experience this turned out to be! We booked at Apricot Tree on a friend's recommendation and he obviously wanted to surprise us because he did not reveal too much about it. So we did not expect much but were simply delighted with everything about the hotel - the charming courtyard with the Apricot Trees and the absolutely stunning view of the Indus river from every room. Mr Wangchuk's impeccable taste is evident in the decor as everything has just the right touch of traditional design without being overdone or too kitschy. And the food - delicious! I can still taste the perfect  paneer pakodas we had at tea time and crepes served at breakfast. The ladakhi meal they put together for us was really the best meal we had in the entire Ladakh trip.

On the banks of river Indus, surrounded by beautiful apricot trees, mulberry and rose bushes and majestic poplars, this is a slice of heaven. The rooms are surprisingly luxurious and comfortable. You can see that every minute detail had been personally addressed. Mr. Wangchuk is a delightful host and I still miss our conversations over the fabulous ginger tea. Another thing to marvel and enjoy is the food. The chef is par excellence and we loved every single meal we had there from Indian to laddakhi to Chinese, everything was delicious.

Minimalist design interweaving the Ladhaki motives gives a sophisticated outlook and adds to the serenity. All ratings for the location. Efficient service. Responsive front desk. No TV in the rooms. Food is ok, nothing special. We ordered for lunch which was a set menu but each dish was separately charged. We were offered dishes which we would never order.

In the evening and late night, we sat on the balcony and admired the beautiful mountain under the full moon with the rustling sound of the Indus river flow.  Service was excellent and staff too very courteous. Food too was excellent  As the property was surrounded with sweet and juicy Apricot trees, we all had a stomach full of them.

The entry area with its open to air ..no ceiling concept helps you feel the fresh crisp air.

Though the area is undeniably beautiful the main supply road was still closed when we arrived, which meant a lack of variety of food and drink, as well as 75% of the cafes, restaurants and hotels being closed during our stay.  Our discovery of The Apricot Tree, then, was provided much needed respite. The location is gorgeous - it sits alongside a glacial, icy blue Indus River across from a dark mountain.

What I really liked about this place was its serene location, quiet surroundings and no TV, that made us spend more time with our family and friends.   The staff is great and helpful with as much they can do for their guests with limited resources.  It seems that this place follows European style meal timings with no flexibility as such. Though this works great for hotels with sightseeing opportunities around where people leave early and come back to sleep after dinner.

We stayed here 2 nights and it was absolute recuperation for the entire group. The staff is very friendly but didn't  seem to be very happy to see Indian guests.

I had a detail discussion with the resort owner that it's an excellent property just ensure your staff from receptionist to Chef focus more on hospitality rather than standard approach ""No"".Food spread was very limited and so do the overall service.
