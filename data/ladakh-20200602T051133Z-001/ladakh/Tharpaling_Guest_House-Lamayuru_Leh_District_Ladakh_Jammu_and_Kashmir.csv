ladakh,"After visiting the monastery, we were looking for a place to have lunch...with very limited options in the area, we reached Tharpaling Restaurant... there were 2-3 cars parked and people were eating, so we thought the food must be good...we were wrong.  The options were really very limited... not even full menu was available...we had to settle for dal-rice-subzi and maggie... it took an eternity to come... and maggi was sandy... yes sandy....it looked like blowing wind in vicinity carried little sand and finally  settled on our plate...couldn't eat it... finally flushed it with coke... really, god and coke are omnipresent...   Please carry some bread / jam / dryfruits for emergency...it is better than having sandy food and spending a bomb...and yes, they accept only cash at the",gauravkhattar,/Profile/gauravkhattar,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
ladakh,"After casing a few joints in little Lamayuru town and finding a range of qualities and prices, we were approached by the eminently smiling host of Tharpaling to have a look at her rooms. Her bustling, happy manner immediately sold me and I decided I'd stay with her regardless of the rooms. She just had that vibe. Luckily the rooms were lovely, in what I can only suspect is an entirely authentic Ladakhi style house. My room had sunny windows, a big bed, even some comfy sofa chairs for entertaining, and best of all Breakfast and Dinner were included in the room price. We happily accepted whatever she was cooking but for other fussier guests she happily made them special dinners to order, no fuss. I wish we could have stayed longer, it was altogether an heart-warming experience.",Nandeez,/Profile/Nandeez,,50
ladakh,"I stayed 5 night there. I had a nice and wide room, with 2 window, with a warm feeling. Shared bathroom (they also have some rooms with private bathroom). Altogether it was very fair value for price. And it was very clean. Owner are very friendly and helpful, making you feel at home.  They also propose breakfast and diner, which, depending on day, was between ok and very good (very good Ladakhi food, eg  tukpa). The only bad point is that the guesthouse is on the road, and there is quite some traffic (trucks).  Altogether a highly recommended guesthouse/homestay in Lamayuru.",Danylaos,/Profile/Danylaos,,40
ladakh,Our hosts were very friendly and always smiling. The room and the food were basic in a typical ladakh house. Well located in Lamayuru for the village and monastery exploration on foot.  Beer was available to buy at the quite reasonable price. Be aware that the power in Lamayuru is only on in the evening from approx 7-10pm.,kasia_44,/Profile/kasia_44,"Melbourne, Australia",30
ladakh,"camere pulite, personale decisamente gentile, ottima cucina locale. Si presta come base a molte escursioni con base a Lamayuru, internet la sera, la cucina tradizionale permette di assaggiare piatti tradizionali",mario1287855,/Profile/mario1287855,"Turin, Italy",40
ladakh,"Relatively basic, but authentic guest house in the centre of the very beautiful and tiny Lamayuru.  The best bit about this place is the family that run it. They could not be more friendly, helpful or hospitable. Make sure you don't miss out on the amazing dinners and breakfasts that the host cooks. You feel like you are at home in the communal space where meals are served. Your fellow travellers become your family. Solar hot water systems means no cold showers. Internet was down in all of Lamayuru when I was there, but wifi is normally available.",sezmac1,/Profile/sezmac1,"Melbourne, Australia",50
ladakh,"it is run by a family. They provide very homely food. They have restaurant down, near the bus stand too. The lady was very nice and she made one of the best masala chai we had. The rooms are spacious. No attached toilet available. For 3 rooms, they have a common bathroom and toilet. The view from the room was really good too. Its a bit noisy because the leh-srinagar highway was down. But still not that bad.",Vipin87,/Profile/Vipin87,"Kerala, India",40
ladakh,"This is a family house. A farmers family house in the Himalaya, but in the heart of Lamayuru's village. 10 minutes walking to the monastery. Don't expect anything like an hotel. But it's not what you want, isn't it ? The owners are genuinely friendly, food is laddhaki and fantastic, and the whole is a true wonderful local experience. Don't miss it !!",Thierry222,/Profile/Thierry222,Paris,50
