ladakh,"We stayed in hotel ladhak Retreat 2nd week September 2019. stunned with incident happened in our room on 13th September 2019 (Room No. 103 which is in front of reception around 10-15 mtrs away) at last night before we leave for Mumbai. Rs.12,000 were stollen from our room when we left for dinner at around 9.25 pm in hotel restaurant. When we hightlited this incident with the hotel management, however the response from their side was shocking and claiming that,it could be stolen by other group members who are our own family members. No CCTV camera in the hotel lobby left us with no option than leaving our concern unattended considering the early morning flight to Mumbai on next day. As they were suggesting police complain looking at our early morning flight by forcing us to stay",Sarita,/Profile/Shetesarita,,10
ladakh,"Decent place with an amazing staff and service. Very helpful and friendly team always ready to help enhance your Leh experience.  Special mention for Manager Nikki, very courteous and pleasant. Thank you for the beautiful rooms allotted to us. The chef Mahender, made even a simple dish like lentil and rice also taste amazing. Great food away from home!  Last but not the least Vipan (Steward) was simply the difference in making our stay from nice to amazing. He provided the customer service experience which a lot of Multinationals spend millions to try and inculcate in their teams. Kudos to him.  Highly recommend place to stay.",Sandeep2611,/Profile/Sandeep2611,"New Delhi, India",50

ladakh,"We had a great stay here, with two rooms, both of them had pretty nice/big balcony, the rooms are decent in size, and have all amenities. The views from the balconies are just great, and the best part is the location of this hotel, its not in the city, so you don't have to get into the narrow lanes of leh city, it is slightly on the out skirts, and thats what adds value. The Shanti stupa is just about 10 mins drive from here. The food was also great, and they have lots of open space outside their restaurant. The only drawback was that wifi used to come only in the lobby and not in the rooms.",nitin_khurana_15,/Profile/nitin_khurana_15,"Noida, India",50
ladakh,"We had a room on the first floor (room 213 i think) with a great view of the snow capped  mountains.  We went in the last week of Sept to early October.  Snow was more than usual due to recent rains.  The resort is fairly close to the city. Food was wholesome and tasty.  Only drawback i found was the lack of any heating in the rooms especially since we went when the temperatures were upto 10 degrees C daytime (and below 0 at night).  The resort shuts down in early October and reopens in March. The owner of the resort Mr Dorjey is very friendly and will help you plan your itinerary. He owns resorts in Nubra Valley and in the  town of Leh for those who want to stay in the winter months.

ladakh,This was my 1st family trip to leh from 7th to 15th June. People in leh are very humble & friendly. Ladakh Retreat is a prime example of that. They have amazing staff including the desk manager Nikki (always smiling). Must say anyone going to Leh have to stay here because of there location with view of snow covered peaks in front & shanti stupa from back. Also dont forget to see mesmerizing flying Indian flag from all front rooms. Food was amazing & staff was quick to respond on phone calls.

ladakh,"As we approached Leh from Srinagar, the scenery drastically changed from picturesque landscapes to barren toothy mountains and sand dunes; this made me curious about the hospitality that would receive us in a place so different from the lovely Srinagar. Thankfully, we realised, later that day, that we were in good hands under the stewardship of Nikki, who ran Ladakh Retreat with a degree of professionalism that was not removed from informality and accommodation.  The two rooms that we were shown into were large and airy; one of them had an ideally located balcony looking out at the distant peaks, although the weather outside, even in May, was far too chilly to sit outside and enjoy a cup of coffee. The washrooms were clean and we were provided with bath soap, shampoo, and",Arka B,/Profile/ArkaB57,"Bengaluru, India",40

ladakh,"Ladakh retreat is definitely one of the most ideal place to stay in leh. We stayed there for 5 days during the last week of September and it felt like home. Good location, great food, beautifully rooms which is tastefully decorated . The view of the snow capped mountains from the balcony, the cup of mint tea in the lawns and the warmth of the blanket on the chilly nights are something's to dote for. But the one thing that sets Ladakh retreat apart is the hospitality. Ms Nikki the manager of the retreat is really awesome , always ready to help and ever smiling. Mr Dorjey the owner  is also a nice and warm person and is very informative. Overall the staff members are execellent and very well trained.

As mentioned by Prachi my wife in earlier review some improvements needed viz providing bucket in bathroom or providing towels or drinking water in the room on their own. But I would say these are very minor things. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful and provided everything immediately on request. The girl who is the present hotel manager is new to the profession but extremely polite and helpful. Would highly recommend this hotel.

Step out of the reception area & snow peaks appear in front of you. The place is very calm & quiet as its a bit far from market place. However, that is no constraint at all since one can always take a vehicle.  More than the property, the staff & the partner who run it are worth a mention. We interacted with Doraji (hope, I spelled it right), who is one of the partners. His hospitality & eagerness to help is beyond compare. Even on 3rd day, when he knew that we are shifting to another hotel as per plan, he didn't hesitate to wait a bit in helping us with our tickets, driver etc.  Great people, great place, great",suyogsaraiya,,,50
