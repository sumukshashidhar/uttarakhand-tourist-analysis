ladakh,Living in a camp at such a mesmerizing location is such an amazing experience that it belittles all other factors! The camps are nice and clean with all basic amenities. Food is good..it's commendable how the staff tries to make your stay comfortable with limited resources. Hot water is provided in the mornings for an hour or so. Electricity is available for a few hours in the evening. All this makes the stay even more enjoyable! The camp location is a little difficult to find due to lack of sign boards and a bumpy approach road. Don't expect a 5-star experience..but it sure is an experience of a lifetime!,Swati A,/Profile/SwatiA318,,40
ladakh,"If you wanna enjoy your adventure by the river, this is the best deal.. Hunder village has solar based power supply during 7:30 PM to 11 PM every day.. You need to charge all your electronic equipments during these hours.. You'll get hot water in the morning for taking shower as well.. Other than that there is no power supply in the whole village including Cold Desert Camp.. Thus, its a good place for experiencing technology detox.. Experience once and you won't regret....",lalliansanga,/Profile/lalliansanga,"Aizawl, India",50

Also there  were 4-5 people apart from us who were arguing as they were also not alloted the tent .   As our booking was confirmed, they had given us an alternative  accommodation of cheaper quality.  We had booked this camp as the views are pretty good from this camp but we were not able to enjoy it.  Hence i feel this camp is not trustworthy.   ",mausam n,/Profile/mausamn,,20

The food is fair...nothing special.  I would suspect that the bed linens are not changed daily, so bring a liner or sleep in your clothes.     It appeared that some of nearby camps had nicer accomodations.  But since most people only stay one night.....no real problem considering where in world you are spending the night.

The road to the Cold Desert Camp (from the main road), was quite bumpy which is understandable, because the camps are located right on the banks of Shyok (Nubra) river; and in the lap of snow-bound hills. Once we reached there we were amazed by its location. The camp has about 14/15 good quality absolutely neat and clean tents.

ladakh,Best Place to Stay ! You really have to try it and meet the friendly but professionnal Aziz.  If you travelling in this part of North India let have some days relax in the Cold Desert Camp. An Awesome moment !,999morgan,/Profile/999morgan,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",50
ladakh,"I stayed there few times. Best spot with wonderful view, staff is nice and welcoming, tents are good and with attached bathroom. Service of quality! :) We also did camel riding in middle of the mountain. Magic!",MissMaliko,/Profile/MissMaliko,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"One of our best stays I've ever had outside of home. This is a great place to stay and I would recommend this to anyone who visits Nubra valley for the following reasons: a) Location: You have fantastic views of the mountains right outside of your tent. This place is also just a 5 min drive from desert that have the double-humped camel rides b) Quality of tents: A camp/tent stay is typically recommended when you go to Leh on a vacation and this is probably the best you can find. The weather is not too cold in Nubra, and in addition, the tents are extremely well insulated, so you dont feel the cold. Bathrooms are brilliantly equipped given that this is an outdoor campsite. There is also hot water that comes in for about 2-3 hours in the morning c) Food: They made us some",Vinay N,/Profile/120vinayn,"Chennai, India",50
ladakh,"Nothing less than heaven!!!!!!! It's a place where kindness, quality and genuinety culminate, from the moment we renters that place till the time we left all we felt were truly welcomed! Being a hotelier myself, I believe a hotel only runs cuz of it's people, and this is why cold dessert came is so close to my heart, it was a special holiday for me and my mum before I get married next year, the beauty is unparalleled !!!! Waking up to a scene like happens only in dreams!!!!!  A must visit!!!!",Hippieland,/Profile/Hippieland,"Doha, Qatar",50
ladakh,"My wife and 2 friends spent one night at the cold desert camp in Nubra. This place has arguably the best location one can imagine for a night's stay as it is in the middle of the valley with views of mountains all over. Given the location, the comforts that these tents offered were unparalleled. Very warm and friendly staff, warm running water, a solidly pitched tent with ample room, warm insides of the tend despite the cold winds outside in the night, and excellent food served for dinner and breakfast were but some of the highlights of this stay. A must-stay and don't worry about it being cold here as it is not!",Pradeep R,/Profile/PradeepR_12,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",50
ladakh,"A perfect pristine location ... with river flowing  nearby... Beautiful luxury camp with necessary facilities like hot water, comfortable bedding , spacious and clean attached bathroom.   The food was awesome... It was nice surprise to have homely food in such tough terrain. The hospitality and friendly behaviors of the staff made the stay memorable...  Hope to visit this pace again :) :) :)",sudeepjnu,/Profile/sudeepjnu,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"The location is stunning, the tents well-made and maintained and the service good. Since it is located at the end of the Hunder village, and there are no other tents or habitation nearby, the locale is peaceful and serene.   The river runs right outside the camp compound. The changing colours of the waters, sky and mountains make it the best place to spend a relaxed evening, walking or sitting by the river.   Although we were initially confused on where we should stay in Hunder, we finally made the right choice.",TheNightjar,/Profile/TheNightjar,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"A peaceful place. It is a luxury tent camp site with all the necessary facilities. Hot and cold running water,  power back up and a neat and spacious bathroom (made as a part of the tent) Food was good. It is located close to the dessert where the sand dunes and double camel hump rdes are avaialble",snarayan83,/Profile/snarayan83,Mumbai,40
ladakh,"Two of us stayed in this camp for a night during last week of July '13.  We reached this place after checking out couple of options which included a camp nearby (which was apparently cheaper than this in both price and quality) and a local guest house. One must see the beauty of this place to believe that the pictures available on web of this camp doesn't do justice in any way. It is the only camp in Hunder next to the river and completely surrounded by mountains in extremely pictorial way (like how we used to draw nature when we were young). Al tough this place is usually completely booked, we got the last camp waiting for a Discovery team which returned from Khardung-la due to their bad health. Our luck. We immediately booked.  The food was fantastic with chicken curry, some",amanluthra,/Profile/amanluthra,"Delhi, Delhi, India",50
