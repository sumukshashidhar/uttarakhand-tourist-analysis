ladakh,"The tour company we traveled with, Unplugged Life, put us up at Camp Redstart during our stay at the magnificent Pangong Lake. We really liked our stay here, the tent, even though looks quite flimsy, was really warm at night. The dining room is spotless, and loved how the cutlery was arranged. Food was simple and good. We poked our heads into the staff room/kitchen tent, and they invited us in, we had kawa tea with the workers while they played cards and served food - this was the highlight, to get an insight into how these temporary 6 months of the year camps work. Would have liked to have stayed one more night, to enjoy the walk near the lake, close to the camp. Even though you don't get hot water in the taps in Pangong area, the boys are up early to bring you a boiling bucket!",faludafabia,/Profile/faludafabia,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Camp Redstart is just at walking distance of 5mins from the Pangong Tso. We were able to view the blue Tranquil Lake right from our tent beds üòç We had reached the campsite late night at 11pm since the direct Nubra to Pangong road was closed and we had to travel Nubra - Leh - Pangong. Even though we reached late,  the staff was generous enough to serve us dinner at this late hours.  The food is good. Dinner served was buffet system. People should not have too high expectations regarding food at this high altitudes in general at all places in Leh Ladakh. Enjoy the Ladakhi style food preparations.  The climate at Pangong is difficult during night since temperature drops to upto 1 degrees C in July (when we visited). Carry proper thermal and woolen wears. The Swiss tents are well",Prerana S,/Profile/PreranaS45,,50
ladakh,"An adventurous journey along the rough, rugged mountain roads via the Chang La Pass brought us to the Picture-Perfect Pangong Tso. The reservations which had been made courtesy the Hotel Glacier View of Leh led us to the Redstart Camp, with cute little tents, neat and tidy, sparkling white on the outside and a warm cosy earthy tint from the inside, with a clean and compact toilet.  There is pretty little else to be desired for, more so, when the beautiful Pangong Lake is just a stone's throw away !!!! We were accorded a warm welcome and briefed about the guidelines to be followed and the meal timings. Tea and biscuits were complimentary and a platter of assorted vegetable 'pakoras' was served upon being asked for. Dinner which comprised of a well thought out Indian fare was very",monideepa d,/Profile/monideepad,"Bangalore District, India",50
