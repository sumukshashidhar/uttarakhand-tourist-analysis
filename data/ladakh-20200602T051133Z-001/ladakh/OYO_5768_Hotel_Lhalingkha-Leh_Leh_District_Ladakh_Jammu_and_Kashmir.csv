ladakh,Its an excellent property to stay. Very near to market still away from hustle and bustle.You feel in calm staying here.Mr Praveen the Hotel manager is an excellent person and always greet you with the smile. He arranged all the tour requirements of ours. I directly called him from Delhi to book my hotel .Picked us from airport at leh and provided vehicle for rest of our tour also. He even made arrangements for my one night visit to Nubra valley at Alpenglow resort and camps.Hotel food is excellent.Both breakfast and dinner (MAP plan) were awesome.Hotel and rooms were neat and clean. Room service was very fast and professional.I would definitely recommend others to stay here.Will give 5 star rating to the property.,Manjul Chadha,/Profile/ManjulC5,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",50
ladakh,It's a nice buotiuqe property with 15 odd rooms on lower Tukcha Road. Leh market is walkable yet you are away from the mad rush. The boys who majorly migrate from kashmiri and himachal for employment during season always had smile on their face while serving the guests. The only improvement area is buffet breakfast... They need to bring variety in food as guests staying for longer time will get bored. Another option would be that book only B&B and have lunch and dinner from innumerable restaurant and cafes dotted across Leh. Parking is also limited for cars. Rooms are well appointed. ,George V,/Profile/GeorgeV392,"Bengaluru, India",40

ladakh,"I was surprised to see a 4.5 star rating for this hotel and that is exactly the reason that compelled me to book a room in this hotel. However the hotel was pathetic. I was allotted room no 205 which was infested with numerous house flies. The room was not cleaned before it was given to me and it had dead flies lying all around. In spite of complaining, the hotel manager did not change the room stating that they did not have any other rooms available. However, I did see other rooms getting allotted to other guests. The room was cleaned and hot was sprayed after I complained a lot. I was told not to open the balcony door to avoid the flies from coming in. However, with hit sprayed in the room and at such a high altitude, I was unable to breath and the smell of the hit made me",y5krahul,/Profile/y5krahul,"Mumbai, India",10
