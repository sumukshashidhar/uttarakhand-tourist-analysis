ladakh,"Me and my wife visited Leh in june 2013 and stayed at Shasipa Guest House for 6 days.Top floor rooms are really nice n comfortable with clean bathrooms, large windows and an open courtyard for sun basking. This place is just 5 mins walk from market(via shortcut) with very peaceful surroundings. It is a family run guest house who take care of their guests very well. There is a large kitchen on 1st Floor having Ladakhi style sitting with views of snow covered mountains where meals are served. You can pre order your lunch/dinner/B'fast or can visit one of the several restaurants in the market at walkable distance. Last but not the least this place offers very good value for money.",atul737,/Profile/atul737,"Noida, India",40
