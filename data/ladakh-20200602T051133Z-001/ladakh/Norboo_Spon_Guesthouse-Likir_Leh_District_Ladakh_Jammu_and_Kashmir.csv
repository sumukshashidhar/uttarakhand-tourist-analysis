ladakh,"A really nice place! The place is stunning for its view and a real gate away. Team are amazing people, worth the trip there only for that experience! The guesthouse is very clean, very nice food and good coffee! :) I would definitely come back",laksmionthebeach,/Profile/laksmionthebeach,,50
ladakh,"This is a well known guesthouse in Ulley - Ladakh. This was the starting point for my solo trek up to Ulley so I stayed here for one night. The room was nice very basic for trekkers, backpackers, creative people and nature lovers. The views are very nice as well and I did some long exposure star trails here. You can checks the photos too.  The word 'Spon' means artist or painter and this owner is a famous artist in Ladakh. Some of his work can be seen at the guesthouse which is run by his parents. Enjoyed the food out here. Simple and basic but delicious and they fed me well for my upcoming trek.  The whole guesthouse area is quiet spacious with a lawn. There are a couple of common 'western' restrooms which are kept very clean. I stayed on the first floor so am not sure if there",melroyd80,/Profile/melroyd80,Goa,40
