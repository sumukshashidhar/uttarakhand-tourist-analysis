ladakh,"We (family) stayed at this property for 1 night in Kargil (as a halting place, on our road trip from Srinagar to Leh). The hotel is a 5min walk from the bus / taxi stand and 8-10min walk from the main market area. It is ideally located on the banks of the river Suru. The rooms are large and spacious, very neat and clean. The bathroom is also big enough with hot water geyser fitting. There is flat-screen TV in the rooms with proper cable connection. The rear-side of the hotel faces the Suru river and mountains beyond. It is a brilliant view.  We had vegetarian dinner and breakfast at the hotel. All the items - soup, vegetables, dal, fried rice, paratha etc. were very good and tasty.   There was a very good dry-fruits store, bang opposite the hotel across the road.

Even when it is available you have to call up the reception and ask them to turn it on for your room. The food is good. Staff very friendly.

Kargil, to many, gained prominence after the 1999 conflict between India and Pakistan, and the war memorial was pretty much the only thing we looked forward to visiting during our trip to Kargil. As things turned out, however, the Kargil War Memorial is located some distance away from the Town of Kargil and the town was, all things considered, rather a drab blot in the middle of one of the most picturesque places in the world.

ladakh,We were there in kargil on last week of june and we stayed at Zojilla Residency and found the hotel to be awesome and the hotel is about 1.5km from the city it was very peaceful. Here the staff was too good And another good thing about this hotel it has a nice river side view . To have the wifi u hv to cum to ground floor to get access  But found the food to be costly in this hotel. So i request all the travellers who are willing to stay in dis hotel to buk ur rooms along with ur food as it will cost u less.

ladakh,"I don't expect much when I stay in a hotel worth 1.2k-1.5k a night, but I have lots of expectations when I am paying more than 5k for a night stay. We decided to stay in kargil on-route to Leh from Srinagar. Since the rooms looked good, we didn't think twice and stayed there. Would strongly suggest not to stay here if you want your next day's journey to be pleasant!  Being internet-deprived on our way, i discovered the hotel had a wifi. (super slow with absolutely no password!) after using it for some time, I mentioned this to the receptionist. To my horror, he added some extra charge (around 200 per device) for my internet usage. I was literally stunned, because probably I was the only one paying for it. Oh, and by the way, WiFi is available only at the reception area, NOT in",prasannjeet,/Profile/prasannjeet,"Vaxjo, Sweden",20

This was annoying but to add fuel to it, the management was callous and couldn't care less. After we said that we will write a bad review they said go ahead we don't care.

ladakh,"I stayed in this hotel with group of my friends during our Leh trip in August 2014 for one day. We had two rooms booked for six of us. I booked this hotel through a travel agent in advance.  Normally people halt in Kargil for overnight stay during their travel from Srinagar to Leh or return. There are few good choices available for stay in Kargil and “Zojilla Residency” is the best one.  This is a newly built hotel, so you feel that newness in everything, right from furniture, amenities, electrical etc. The rooms are big enough and equipped with all modern amenities like LCD TV, air-conditioning etc. The toilet area is also big enough and fitted with all modern toiletries. Hot water is available during specified time of the day only. Hotel does not have elevator facility as of",Kunal Rane,/Profile/Kunal_J_Rane,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,We stayed at the hotel on a night stopover between Srinagar and Leh. There are no branded hotels in Kargil but this seems the best choice. The check in was smooth. The property seemed relatively new and was well maintained. The rooms were clean. A few of the rooms however had windows on the eastern side with bright sunlight right on the bed early in the morning which was irritating. Otherwise a good sleep. I didnt see any heaters but it wasnt so cold outside. One might want to check if they provide the same during/around winters. Bathrooms were clean and had running hot water.   The restaurant had buffet dinner with decent spread as compared to other places we stayed during the Ladakh trip. Food quality too was ok. Ditto for the breakfast spread and quality. The staff was nice. ,gprathor,/Profile/gprathor,"Mumbai, India",30

So we requested a change and then we were booked into the Zojila Residency. It is a wonderful place when talking about the rooms. They are modern and spacious with very nice bathrooms, flat screen TV, etc. Also, the food variety is good and quality was fine. Staff was always polite and helpful. The only bad things: It is quite badly built from acoustic point of view. So, we were not lucky since we had a family practically next door which was shouting and running, etc. At 4 a.m. they started shouting again because it seems they left early.

The washrooms were clean and the staff was very hospitable and courteous. The wifi was not working due to the devastation caused in srinagar. Hooka was available too with 5 flavors. The food at the hotel was pretty good however was a bit overpriced.

When one took our bags to the room another joined him outside our room but did nothing.  They both stood in the room obviously waiting for a tip as if they were entitled to one.  All the other hotels we had stayed at in India had friendly, helpful staff who went out of their way to help which contrasted with these surly people.  A comprehensive course in customer care might help.  Also some female staff might lighten the atmosphere.

The hotel had a lot of guests checking in at the same time and the check in was slow, yet the staff was courteous. The rooms were large, clean, though the matresses and furnishing was very basic. The buffet meal included along with the room package was good (B/D). Hot running water was available. Checkout, though was a bit disappointing. The staff had no idea on how much advance we had paid. We were carrying copies of emails exchanged that carried confirmation on how much amount had already been paid.

The deluxe room is reasonably spacious with a comfortable bed. The bathroom is clean and hot water runs in the evening and morning. During our 2nd stay, hot water was lukewarm, barely sufficient for shower. Working shower with good pressure.

The rooms are solid, spacious and comfortable, many with river views, and the bathroom is good, although HW not always available. We had some power cuts (found this is not unusual all around Kashmir/Ladakh). It's a bit out of town, and not a nice place to walk around in due to construction mess and roaming groups of young men.

Morning we woke up to a rude shock of lack of hot water. However the staff was kind enough to open other rooms where some were lucky to get hot water. The food was also highly ok. Nothing great.
