ladakh,"We left Jispa in the morning and had a 3 hour delay in Sarchu, by the time we made it to Lato we were exhausted. This guest house was very nice with a lovely family that runs it. The power was out but they had a generator that kept the lights on and kitchen open. We enjoyed a fabulous bowl of noodle veggie soup, which was made fresh at our request. The room was great with private bathroom and shower. If you are looking for somewhere nice to stay (and don't fancy Pang) push on to Lato Guest House. Also know, the road between Pang and Lato is very good, paved nearly all the way; you can make good time.",Kelly B,/Profile/kellybP6220FY,,40
ladakh,"We stayed at this guest house in Lato, a small town around 70kms from Leh on our way to Manali from Pangong. This is a decent clean stay on the highway. The food served is also good. Also has proper parking spaces. Bathrooms are clean and hot water available always. Overall a comfortable one night stay",Dilshan_Kunhi,/Profile/Dilshan_Kunhi,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,"My first visit to Lato was in June 2013. I was overwhelmed by the natural beauty of the village. I stayed for a week and then moved on to Leh and Nubra Valley. After some time I missed the peacefulness and climate of Lato. Even though Lato is located on the Leh Manali Highway, the wilderness is a minute's walk away. I spent countless days walking along glacier fed streams. There are colorful rock formations towering above, including frequent herds of bharal or Himalayan blue sheep showing off their climbing skills. Returning back to Lato Guest House after a long hike was equally rewarding. The hosts, Sonam and Tashi, treat you like family. They are extremely accommodating offering tasty home cooked meals with many ingredients harvested from their fields. The comfortable rooms",CraigW482,/Profile/CraigW482,Wondervu,50

ladakh,"I couldn't think of a better place to stay in that incredible paradise as the Manali-Leh highway. I was with my partner in a cycling tour and for some healthy reasons I spent 3 nights on my own at Lato Guest House. I have to say that I couldn't feel more confortable and welcomed with Tashi and his family who let me fell like at home. I felt it like a very true cultural experience and really enjoyed a few calm days in this isolated part of the the world. Room were good and clean, food was very good and views were amazing!!! And still very cheap. I hope to go back some day!",lucia_tejedor,/Profile/lucia_tejedor,,50
ladakh,"I recommend this guest very much , it is run by owning family itself and they are very good hosts. Very much recommended and the best you can expect in this highway. Food is also very good. You get warm water which is a blessing in this area. ",Gurdit S,/Profile/gurdits2017,,50
ladakh,"This is a basic but clean guest house in a lovely village. The facilities are relatively new and worked fine, bathroom en suite.  Food was basic but tasty and home made. The surroundings and the people were charming. The service was cheerful. I think this family is building a growing business. There was one guest there who checked in a month ago and never left! Try the Ladahki bread at breakfast.",Tommy,/Profile/158tomp,"Santa Barbara, California",30
