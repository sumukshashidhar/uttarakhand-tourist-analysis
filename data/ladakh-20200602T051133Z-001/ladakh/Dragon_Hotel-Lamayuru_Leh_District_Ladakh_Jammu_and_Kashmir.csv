ladakh,"I spend two nights in this accommodation, it is more a guesthouse with a restaurant than a hotel. The treatment for travelers is kind and every time take care of your needs to make you feel comfortable. The restaurant has a nice assortment of local and international food with outside tables to enjoy the starry nights or the company of other travelers. The availability of wifi is a blessing because once you left Leh city, there is no wifi available. I started the first stretch from the Lamayuru-Alchi trek from Wanla and return again to Lamayuru just to enjoy one more night in the Dragon hotel. They arranged transport car with locals to share costs with other travelers and get better fares but for this, you need to ask for a transport service with time enough to arrange",Julian R,/Profile/924julianr,,50
ladakh,"Nice hotel in Lamayuru, walking distance to the monastery. Beautiful garden with flowers, fruit trees and sitting area. Only little complain, the orders in the restaurant really took long to be served, you must have a lot of time (we had time).",Joerg F,/Profile/joergf555,"Berlin, Germany",50
ladakh,"I love this place and this hotel. All is fantastic and the atmosphere is very warm. The room was big and comfortable.  So, I booked for one night and I stayed there one night more.  Another strong point is the restaurant: I have really appreciated it.  I will come back again for sure!",PAOLA SCACCABAROZZI,/Profile/viaggiatrice7010,,50
ladakh,"Right next to Leh Kargil highway. Run by Mr. Tashi, very helpful and affable person. Attached restaurant serves North Indian food. You may get Ladhaki as well if requested. There are 8 nicely appointed rooms with attached bath. Rooms on first floor has great view,  specifically 103 and 104 which has full wall to wall windows. Free WiFi works great. You get nice monastery view from hotel garden. ",Kunal Kaviraj,/Profile/kkaviraj,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,"Five minutes after we arrived at the Dragon Hotel, my husband realized he had left a small backpack with valuables in our taxi, which had already sped off toward Leh. The staff and owners sprung into action, calling the police and driving my husband to a checkpoint down the road where the police intercepted the cab to retrieve his backpack. They got us out of a major jam, with complete grace, and we could not be more thankful! On top of their excellent service, they offer good food, great wi-fi and comfortable beds in rooms with a view. Thank you again!",Calida C,/Profile/calidac2017,,50
ladakh,"At 700 rupees a night this was the most expensive place I stayed in Ladakh - and the room was very nice, it's true, with a beautifully clean bathroom attached.  However, it took seven hours and five reminders to get an extra blanket; the much touted internet connection was never working; when I asked for toast, mashed potatoes, or curd, all of which were on the menu, I was told ""we have chapatis""; and in the morning, I was actually imprisoned in my room by some idiot member of staff who seeing the bolt on the outside of the door was open, decided to bolt it.  Not very impressed.",captainnedludd,/Profile/captainnedludd,"Norwich, United Kingdom",20
