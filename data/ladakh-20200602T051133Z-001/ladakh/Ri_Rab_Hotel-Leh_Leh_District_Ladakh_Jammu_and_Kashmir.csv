ladakh,"It's back from the road, so it doesn't suffer from as much noise and dust as many of the places on Changspa Road. I would definitely recommend the rooms on the other side facing the mountains, though. The views are rather obstructed by trees and other guest houses, but you can see a bit of the mountains. The rooms are pretty ordinary, Rs700 for a single and Rs1,000 for a double. Mattresses are foam and a bit soft for my taste. Running hot water is available morning and evening only (from a boiler). The floors are covered in rather tired vinyl, and there is a general air of shabbiness. I found the staff are friendly and helpful. There is room service but not a real restaurant. There's a rooftop terrace where you can sit out.",Peregrineri,/Profile/Peregrineri,"New Delhi, India",30
ladakh,"The place is a welcoming budget hotel situated in a peaceful neighbourhood very close to the market therefore easily accessible. The staff was cordial and polite. The rooms are very basic, food is good too. The garden and terrace offer a good sitting and dining experience.  Overall a nice place in a great price.",Mansimran K,/Profile/47mansimrank,,40

ladakh,"We were unable to check in as hotel was closed! Phone number provided didn't work! So disappointed! Manager was very rude over the phone the next day when we called her, eventually after getting the right number she was rude and told us that they don't have reception 24hours and nobody would wait for our check in! If I was running hotel and if my guests wouldn't arrive I would have phoned them!  Never again",missragazza,/Profile/missragazza,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",10

ladakh,"We stayed here for couple of days spread over a week as part of biking group.  Got to stay in 2 different rooms on 2 occasions.  Clean beds, with clean bathrooms, and decent food (buffet organized by the touring group).  The only advantage is not far away from shopping places, so you could walk and explore from here.",shishirgowda,/Profile/shishirgowda,"Bengaluru, India",30
ladakh,Nothing to brag about but nothing to complain about either. Except the manager who has drinking problem. Other staff was quite professional. They have simple breakfast arrangements but no lunch or dinner. Good stay for a budget hotel though.,Mrugesh.thaker,/Profile/Mrugeshthaker,"Ahmedabad, India",30
ladakh,We stayed at the Hotel Ri-Rab for a period of 11 days as it remained the base location for all our bike rides to other parts of Ladakh. Nice and clean with hospitable staff. The cook dishes out great Indian fare if informed in advance,AbhayTilwankar,/Profile/AbhayTilwankar,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Five of us, riding buddies stayed in Ri Rab in end August 2012. It was end of season. The rooms were clean, lot of parking space for parking our bikes. The food was good. One night there was no power and we wanted our camera batteries to be charges. The hotel manager started the generator (we were the only guests in the hotel) and served us dinner in their dining hall. We had kept all our luggage there itself while we did our Pangong Tso overnight trip and we were not charged for those days as promised.",Hulbatte,/Profile/Hulbatte,"Pune, India",30
ladakh,"This is a hotel to stay if you are looking for cheap accomodation but with decent standards!!   The hotel staff was very helpful, the rooms were well maintained, the food was great and anything if we requested in advance to be cooked, was made and given without an issue!!   Cloak Rooms services were great as we used this hotel as our base for 10 days when we travelled to other places like Pangong, Tsomo Riri, nubra etc and kept coming back to stay a night!!!",Siddharth S,,"Mumbai, India",30

ladakh,"The hotel is located in the Leh Market, providing easy access to all the gud cafes and shops! The rooms are simple, but very neat and clean...the best thing however is the host, who is always ready to help / advise / assist you in anyway possible.

ladakh,This hotel with rate of Rs. 500/- was booked by Cox and King at very high rate. Food is good. Generator is always under repair. Overall quality is filthiest and meant only for stay of animals. Avoid it totally in case you are looking for comforts.,kirankhurana,,"New Delhi, India",10
ladakh,"After an exhausting 22 hour bus from Manali crossing insane altitudes, feeling ill and exhausted we arrived in Leh. Struggled at first to find somewhere with rooms and eventually found this gem :) its very affordable at 500 rupees a night which is yes probably on the pricey side for India but Leh is not a cheap place to visit. The rooms were super clean, with extra blankets for the very chilly evenings, hot water in the mornings, television, and the best part - the most amazing manager called VJ ! So friendly and willing to go the extra mile to help you, we were really sorry to say goodbye ! Leh is without a doubt the most beautiful, amazing and fascinating places I have ever been too. From my experience and speaking with others i recommend the exhausting overland journey to",mhl123,,"Bristol, United Kingdom",50
