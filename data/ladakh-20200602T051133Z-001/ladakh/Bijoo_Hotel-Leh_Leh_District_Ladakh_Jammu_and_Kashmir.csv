A small team manages just about everything. The rooms are very neat and clean as are the bathrooms that have hot water- though at specific timings. WiFi though available tends to be somewhat erratic. Food offered is simple and fairly tasty.  The hotel is a great place to relax with its sit-out areas and a common room.

Since it was our first experience in Leh, we straight headed towards the Leh main market area and found this hoel located on library road which is second lane from Main market area. The hotel had plenty of space for parking and due to parking issue in Leh, it was an advantage for us to park our vehicles in hotel premises. The hotel is spacious, with big lawn and open sitting area.

The staff was very friendly; prepared our breakfast and packed lunch at 3:30 in the morning (we'd to depart by 5:00 to Pangong Tso). The food was good, even the meat was fresh. They even provided me with boiled water when they found out I had an upset stomach. The rooms were very clean; quilt was pretty good. The location was excellent.

The hotel location is great and is in the middle of the leh market with some open space and all the good eating joints just few minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms and bathrooms are clean and hotel does serve food but they have limited options which make sense considering the no. of hotels near by.

ladakh,This is a hotel right in the heart of Leh. Neat comfortable rooms and a lovely property ringed by lovely trees make this a very pleasant hotel. What makes it special is the care and level of responsiveness of the owners and staff who are always at hand to help out with anything from arranging rental cars/bikes to helping out to plan a perfect route and stays at other places of interest in Ladakh and Kashmir. Special interests like trekking and birdwatching are catered to with customized care. They even arranged a pair of good binoculars at short notice for one of our team and special food for some with dietary restrictions.

ladakh,I have been to Ladakh 3 times and I have never stayed anywhere else.  The main reason is Mr. Ashiq Khan the co-owner of this property who is a thorough professional and very very helpful at all times.  One just has to send the itinerary to the hotel in advance and they will do all the further arrangements for you.  The rooms are good and spacious. Staff is very homely and will attend to your needs quickly.  The only room for improvement I feel is the food served here... which has caused stomach problems for me consistently. Initially I attributed this to the acclimatization phase but then I realized that eating out resolved the problems.  As of now I would recommend that you have lunch and dinner outside after the first 2 days of compulsory rest.,Samir_Ovalekar,/Profile/Samir_Ovalekar,"Mumbai, India",50

Besides the market, there are many different restaurants located nearby serving the wonderful Tibetan cuisine. Cleanliness is the best here and taken care of at all times. Comfortable and cosy rooms.

After reading other reviews I was shocked to read others felt it is a good value I imagine most of these people are just out of touch with the reality of the Leh hotel and guesthouse pricing.  The owner Mr Bijoo trys to be charming and lays it on thick as he aggressively overcharges you. Hes nothing but a snake charmer and not a very good one.
