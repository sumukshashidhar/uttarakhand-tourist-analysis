ladakh,"This is a very nice hotel. Its located in the middle of the city, near the Tibetan handicrafts centre. Rooms are quite spacious and clean. We stayed on the first floor - the rooms are definitely warmer. We loved the service and helpfulness of the room boys. We had to go out for trips to Pangong lake etc very early in the morning and these guys always woke up before us and provided us with hot water.  Another great way they helped us was by allowing us to use the kitchen to cook our food; their food was a bit too spicy for some of our group.",bishwaksen,/Profile/bishwaksen,"Kolkata, India",40

ladakh,"I visited Leh during 2st week of July 2015 (from 6 July) with my family and friends. We enjoyed the stay at Chospa Hotel. We booked directly after checking in multiple sites and having discussion with Mr. Stanzin.  Pros:  Rooms are good & well furnished. Hot water is available 24 hours. The hotel is in middle of town, very near to main market, restaurants and ATMâ€™s. Near to bus stand, Airport is approx 5 km. We requested for airport pickup and they booked it for us. It is chargeable. Staffs are good and helpful. Food were delicious and services was great.  Mr. Stanzin also book transport for our trip with best price. He also allow us to keep our extra luggage when we left for Nubra and Pangong without any extra charge.  We enjoyed our stay.",Amit Kumar,/Profile/mramitkumar0607,"Bengaluru, India",40
