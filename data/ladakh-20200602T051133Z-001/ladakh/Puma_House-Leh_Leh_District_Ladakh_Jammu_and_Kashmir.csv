ladakh,"I chose this place because it was a decent price for a long stay (1/2 months) and I could also have access to the kitchen for cooking. The room was nice and big. However, on the last weekof my stay, hot water stopped working in my room and the staff refused to fix it. They never called a plumber, never provided apologies or explanations, and they let me freeze in my room with freezing cold water only in October time. I had to actively ask every morning if I could shower in a different room, the staff was never around or just the guy who barely speaks English. I could not even reach one of the guys running the place on his phone (the only one I had in my contacts) - he kept ignoring my messages and calls. Each morning when he was in the guesthouse, he would come into my bathroom",Liz,/Profile/solohimalayantravel,"Osny, France",20
ladakh,"The facilities are of good quality even for ""demanding customers"" (clean room, warm running water, WiFi) and the staff, especially Mr. Tampel, was super friendly and helpful! He even organized a reasonably-priced trip for us and also the room rate was very reasonable as well. Highly recommended.",Petri H,/Profile/880petrih,,50
