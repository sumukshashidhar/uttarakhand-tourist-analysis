ladakh,"Péssima hospitalidade. Fui com o meu namorado e logo na chegada presenciamos uma briga entre os donos, que são um casal. Sem contar que não fomos informado que o nosso quarto era em um contêiner, sem isolamento térmico e que o banheiro ficava fora do quarto, precisando sair e andar pela grama. A garagem era bem pequena e o carro do meu namorado ficou com a metade para rua e o portão teve que ficar aberto.  As camas não estavam prontas e faltavam fronhas e o dono ficava resmungando e falando que iria pagá-las, como se fosse fazer um favor à nós. Foi aí então que decidimos ir embora, como já havíamos pago 50% adiantados, questionamos a devolução e o dono disse q era só pedir pelo Instagram. Estamos até hoje enfrentando o desdém, a falta de planejamento e clareza do Hostel. ",Carol D,/Profile/caroldT3621YR,,10

ladakh,"I stayed here for Chadar Trek. Rooms are very warm and views are stunning. It is located at the base of Shanti Stupa. You get hot water from solar heater installed. You have to carry water in a bucket. There are two common eco toilets. Could be inconvenient for some. But that's okay at such tariff. You can ask hosts to cook food for you. Breakfast (Rs 120), Lunch/ Dinner (Rs 150), Boiled drinking water (Rs. 10 per bottle). Overall experience was good. The hosts are very nice and helpful.

ladakh,"Been there during winter and the system of environmental friendly of Ladakhis make you fell in love. Friendly and helpful staff from Ecology Hostel. Took almost 15 to 20 minutes walk to the main bazaar, but the view and the location of the hostel is peaceful and quiet.",luciachang,/Profile/luciachang,,50
ladakh,"I highly recommend this place for environment conscious, the solo- traveller types to stay here. I feel im home when im here. I have stayed here during winters on two of my visits to Leh. The view of Shanti Stupa from your windows are out of the world. I have a kind request to guests here to keep quiet and dont play your music here.
