ladakh,"Tried another guesthouse the night before, but decided to wander and found this lovely guesthouse with a spectacular view! Had the front balcony looking out at the mountains of Ladakh. Owner was simply wonderful - kind, accommodating and helpful. Kept our bags while we trekked and set us up in the same beautiful room when we returned.  This quiet guesthouse has a beautiful flower and vegetable garden, and is a short walk to the busier shopping and restaurants area. Highly recommend!",elisa o,/Profile/elisao217,"Erdenet, Mongolia",50
ladakh,"We stayed for only one day here but the hospitality was awesome. The owner runs the guest house and takes care of the guests himself and other family members. Food facility is not provided. Tea/coffee is served in the rooms. Overall it was a great fun. The rooms were very clean. The only problem is that hotel type facilities are not available like dental kits, towels etc. bed sheets are not washed every day.",Tejinder J,/Profile/TejinderJ,Chandigarh,50
ladakh,The couple running the property are super nice Ladhaki people. Rooms have great bedding and space. The furniture is also nice . Wifi is good and Flat screen TVs are also available in rooms. The whole feel of property is refreshing. May be because of the awesome garden and farm. They grow vegetables and apples on the property and if you ask nicely they can hand out a few fresh items from farm as well.  Very clean and well lit property. The plumbing is bit troublesome but not a deal breaker.  They have running hot water . There charges are very less as compared to all the amenities and quality of guest house.,AJAIN_India,/Profile/AJAIN_India,"Greater Noida, India",40

ladakh,"A big hostel in a side street near the center. Quiet place with a nice garden. Clean, big rooms with a nice bathroom. Runned by a friendly couple who always want to help and give you advise. Perfect hostel to visit Leh and surroundings.",Tim W,/Profile/F4811FXtimw,Belgium,50
ladakh,"After a very disapointing night in Ashoka guesthouse (rude-unfriendly personnel and a room that I would even not give to my dog), this place is a real hidden gem in Leh. Nice and comfortable bedroom and bathroom, a lovely terrace and really friendly people! We've done a tour of the town and if you want to have a bit more tranquilety and luxery.... Do not hesitate!",FilipVDH,/Profile/FilipVDH,Belgium,50
ladakh,"I prefer guest house and home stays then hotels. We didn't have any prior booking in Leh so we went to Ashoka Guesthouse only to know its full! Got referred to this newly opened guesthouse. It's located at Main, Tukcha Road. After checking the rooms, we immediately took the room with balcony facing the garden. As we were tired from long 13 hours bus journey, we asked if home-cooked dinner is available and the owners graciously agreed and prepared dinner for us.  Beds are comfortable, bathrooms were neat and clean. They've a beautiful garden at the entrance, 24 hours hot water, free WiFi. But the Internet is dodgy all over Leh so can't blame them if doesn't work. They provide Tea, Lemon Tea on request.  We stayed for a week and did excursions to Nubra, Pangong.

ladakh,"This guest house is relatively new, which is why many people have not heard of it and choose to go for the better known ones.  It is just off the leh market road in a bye lane(fort road, further down from the german bakery). The independent bunglow can be seen from fort road, with a home garden and yellow umbrellas in the sit out.  We were shown this place by the owners father who usually scouts for people searching for accommodation. We were initially hesitant to check the place out, as it was not on the main road, but once he took us in, we were won over.  This guesthouse is like a 5 star, huge rooms with wooden flooring, big bathrooms with 24hour hot water, electrictiy, some rooms have TVs too. And it was all at a great price (better than commercial guesthouses). Meals were",LWM,/Profile/llewemonis,"Bengaluru, India",50
