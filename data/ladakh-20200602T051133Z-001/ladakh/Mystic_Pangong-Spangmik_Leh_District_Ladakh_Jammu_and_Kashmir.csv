ladakh,"Good Food - Friendly staff - Jain food. When we reached there- they were confused about Jain meals. But when we got our dinner served - we were surprised at very good Jain food made by their chef. Anyways Pangong/Nubra valley  hotels do not serve non-veg food. But to make Jain vegetable with the right masala was a surprise. We will never forget. In the morning, the sandwiches served for breakfast,were simply mouth watering. View of the lake from each tent is good. Need to get up early in morning if you are avid photographer. Also hot water doesn't come in bathrooms - they deliver it in each rooms in the morning.",DEVDEEPAK70,/Profile/DEVDEEPAK70,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"It's not a secret that the Pangong Lake is an amazing place to spend at minimum 1 night.   Not for the first time, I booked the Mystic Pangong camp and it was unbelievable. A very nice crew, clean, delicious food and a really place you don't want to leave as soon as you're there. We enjoyed the time a lot.  And I will return.",Sina_Schlatter,/Profile/Sina_Schlatter,"Zurich, Switzerland",50
ladakh,"Mystic Pangong is located a few mins walk away from Pangong Lake bed. The camps are well maintained and have a good view of the Lake and surrounding Mountains. Food served at the restaurant was hot and decent enough. Had a great Sunset photo shoot and enjoyed the stay a lot. The staff is very polite and the Service is also very good. The clear skies and the night view of the stars with surrounding mountains was Mind Blowing.   CAUTION: If you have breathing problems or Asthma, take proper medical advice and plan your travel. Oxygen levels are low and there are cases where people had to be carried away to the Hospital or vacate in the midnight.",RaghuNadhKasturi,/Profile/RaghuNadhKasturi,"Hyderabad, India",40
ladakh,When we reached at this location they said no room is available as for that day it was full. Somehow we got one room as some guest have cancelled. Good tent clean bed and washroom. Those arrangements ar absolutely fine. I also understand difficulty of providing electricity there. Still I would request you to provide one charging point for laptop or battery or mobile. Only one. I know that people misuse electricity there by use of multiplug . Still that is required. It is absolutely ok with food. Breakfast is also very good and their attitude is also very polite. ,Arghya Mukhopadhyay,/Profile/Arghya19,"Kolkata, India",50
ladakh,"We have a perfect one night stay at this tent. This tents are located in Spangmik , 7-8 Km away from starting of Pangong Lake. They welcome us with hot chai and aloo bhaji, which is very much refreshing the cold weather. Tents are of perfect size, clean, warm and well maintained. Toilet is clean, spacious and with running water. One bucket Hot water per tent is available at morning. Lake is 200mtr walking distance from the lake and tent has a awesome view of the lake. At this type of remote location, food quality and variety is quite good and staff behaviour is very polite,helpful. Light at tent and attached toilet is available all the time, which is very much uncommon in other tents. Only minus point I found that, the tents don't have any plug point. Altogether it was very",Krishnendu M,/Profile/217krishnendum,"Kolkata, India",50
ladakh,Stayed here for a night during our Leh Ladakh trip. The tent was as comfy as possible with beddings and running water.  The view from the tent of the lake was awesome.  The spread of the food at dinner was decent and so was the breakfast.  The boys were at our beck and call and served with a ðŸ™‚There was no wifi but no complaints about that :),Prema_C,/Profile/Prema_C,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,Mystic pangong is one of the camps at spangmik some 200odd mts from the lake. The camps has attached bathroom and running water. I was amazed to see at the altitude of 14000ft how efficient the staff is. When i reached after 150km of biking from leh i was greeted with chai and snacks.. the staff made sure i was kept warm by providing me with bucket of hot water and thick blanket with hot water bag food served there was basic but very tasty.  Even at odd hours chai was served. The camps inside were warm neat and clean.  Well my over all experience at mytic pangong was nothing less then mystical and that was made my the effort of the staff and the comfortable camps. ,bharatsheetal,/Profile/bharatsheetal,"Leh, India",50
ladakh,"we have booked 5 tents in this property, really disapointed . its really recomendable that they have managed to make property to stay, such a remote situation. but they really lack in providing services there. if ask for water u have to wait for atleast 1 hour , or its better that u can go by yourself. evening tea was pathetic, food was also of same quality.  not at all a place to stay.",sidjain2017,/Profile/sidjain2017,"New Delhi, India",10
ladakh,"Given the conditions of the pangong, at such high altitude, and border area the camps are reasonably well maintained and provides a heavenly view of the lake. Staff are friendly, clean linen, and a little distant view of the lake, will definitely recommend to friends.",Nadeem K,/Profile/nkhan777,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"We stayed in the camp for one night in the first week of June. It was booked for us by Cox & Kings local tour manager. Location of the camp is good but if you want to go to the lake you have to take a long route. Tents are in good condition, though some of our group members had problems in closing the door flap because of defective zips.   Linen, towels and bed sheets were more or less clean and usable.The attached wash rooms have cemented floors with running (ice cold) water facility. Whereas other camps in the vicinity have installed solar water heaters to supply hot water in the morning they simply give you one bucket of hot water per tent, on demand. If you do not know about it or don't demand they will not bother to give that Another thing is If you do not like their over",Jayendra singh P,/Profile/jayendrasinghp,Udaipur,30
