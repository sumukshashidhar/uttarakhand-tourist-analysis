ladakh,"This was my third time in Kargil, and I've stayed in different hotels each time, but Hotel The Kargil, is by far the best in the region.  Walking distance from the main market, and as you enter from the main entrance, it's hard to believe that such a beautiful hotel is situated so close to the busy street.  Very tastefully constructed, ample space for parking, spacious guest waiting lounge along the reception, good capacity restaurant serving delicious food, very prompt services, Well behaved and very courteous staff. Sparkling clean rooms and bathrooms. Lift available if you're travelling with elderly people. Rooms are equipped with centrally heating mechanism, we didn't felt the need of it in the summer month though.

ladakh,I stayed at The Kargil for 3 nights. The rooms are excellent and have a great view of the Mountains. The bathrooms are super clean.  The staff is cheerful and efficient. The chef from Kerala runs a separate kitchen for Vegetarians and Jains.   But what makes the hotel truly memorable are the little things. They bottle their own water that comes from a Himalayan spring and then put it thru RO. It's an attempt to reduce plastic waste. But if u want they hand over Biseleri as well.  The backyard has a small garden with apricot trees and a pit for a bonfire.  And if u want any help with anything the 3 brothers who run the hotel are always around to help. Ask Zaheer if u are confused about where all u sld visit in Kargil.,Shreya D,/Profile/760shreyad,,50
ladakh,"The Kargil is practically the only decent place you’ll find in this town. It’s a nice hotel that’s a real steal for the price you’re paying. In a region that’s remote, this hotel managed to provide good hot showers that isn’t reliant on the unreliable geyser. After a long rough drive, you can get a good relaxed sleep here. Kargil has a lot of charms and isn’t just a pit-stop town if tourists take the time to explore it and just understand the place better.

ladakh,"Hands down the best place to stay in Kargil. Very courteous and humble staff, great rooms, amazing view and really really clean. Cleanliness is always an issue for me, but this is a brand new hotel, just opened a couple of months ago, so that was not an issue. Hopefully these guys keep up the good work. The rooms are big and spacious. For once they actually resemble the pictures uploaded.",Aditya Sidhra,/Profile/aditya_sidhra,"New Delhi, India",50

ladakh,"My family and I stayed at this lovely hotel last week on our visit in Kargil. Starting with the hotel, it's a lovely structure with nice, luxurious rooms. Location of the hotel is great as well!  The owner (khalid) of the hotel and his staff are the nicest people we've met. This review won't do them justice but please know that they truly care about their customers and go out of their way to make your trip wonderful. 1000% highly recommend!!   When we reached the hotel, my mother wasn't feeling so well. Khalid and his staff, without us even asking, went out of their way to arrange a doctor to come to the hotel and see her and also took her to the hospital and arranged to meet a specialist right away. The next day, as we were planning to leave for Leh. Khalid called up hospitals",Saachi P,/Profile/SaachiP2,,50
ladakh,"Having stayed here for a considerable amount of time, I have always found it difficult to find a suitable place to stay in Kargil, up until I stayed at 'The Kargil.' While it has prime location in terms of being close to the market, the views my room offered were spectacular.   A special shoutout to the kind of service I received though. From the staff, to the people who own the hotel; leave no stone unturned to make you feel like their own. With such a homely feel and fabulous food that is available nowhere else, The Kargil and service remains my all time favourite.",nikinoronha,/Profile/nikinoronha,"Delhi, New York",50
ladakh,"Visited Kargil on my way for two nights to Leh with a group of friends and this hotel was the best decision we could have made. Extremely comfortable with the best service and food - makes you feel at home! Apart from the epic view, the hotel staff went out of their way to help us and ensure that we had a great time. Kargil is relatively untouched from the rest of Ladakh and if it's on your itinerary, then this is the perfect place to stay.",Raghav M,/Profile/RaghavM1991,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Two weeks in Zanskar took quite a toll on my body and mind. When I got back to Kargil, I discovered this hotel, which was just too comfortable. This place has the best shower and Wifi in the whole of Ladakh. Amongst important things: the room was extremely comfortable, great food and that beautiful lawn, where I would spend a lot of time. The rugged terrain of Suru and Zanskar valleys tired me out completely in my fieldwork and the 2 days I was in this hotel completely relaxed me both physically and mentally. The beautiful views of Kargil and the thrill of being in such a historically important place added to the experience. This break was really helpful in the latter part of my travel to other to places in Ladakh.   PS: There is an ultimately cool bunker in the hotel, which you",Vedant R,/Profile/VedantR20,,50
ladakh,"Stayed there in the second week of June. Its a beautiful property  with all the modern facilities and we loved the fire place in the orchard.   The idea was to stay overnight and leave for LEH early morning. But we so loved the place that we decided to stay there for one more day. Khalid, the guy managing the show, recommended few places and we  decided to explore the area. Esp. the road to Panicker village was like a dream and the NUN KUN peaks looked magnificent.   All in all, had a great stay. Thank you guys for making us feel special. Would love to come back soon.  P.S. The corner suite on the second floor gives the best view.",tarunn2003,/Profile/tarunn2003,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"If there were Heaven on Earth, this is it. Far from the Madding Crowd, 200 kms away from Srinagar, Hotel The Kargil is nothing but a bliss. We went there thinking we will also travel the area but the hotel was so convenient and so pristine we didnt feel like venturing out. Big rooms, modern amenties, warm beddings, centrally heated and the choice of vegetarian food was amazing. It was like being at home. Would love to come back soon. Thanks for the wonderful service and hospitality",Vikrant G,/Profile/730vikrantg,,50
ladakh,"We were a group of 5 travelling visiting Kargil for the 3rd time and this time it was without any plan and bookings. After reaching Kargil, someone told us about this new hotel. We decided to have a look but beautiful it was. The place is in the middle of the town Kargil and its quite tough to believe that such a property could be there. Everything, from the rooms to the dining area was exquisite. A big thanks to Khalid and his team who are doing an awesome job.  Its easily the best property in Kargil.  Hopefully, they will keep up the good work.",AmanRajgotra,/Profile/AmanRajgotra,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"I was on of the lucky ones to experience an amazing stay at The Kargil Hotel, to be honest, I didn't expect such a fine hotel in such a remote area of India -   the room was bright with a nice view, bed was super comfortable - indeed, everything was new - lucky me -  I hope they continue to maintain the same standard.  most amazing was the owner of the hotel, very courteous young man... hope to visit again",bandays,/Profile/bandays,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",40
