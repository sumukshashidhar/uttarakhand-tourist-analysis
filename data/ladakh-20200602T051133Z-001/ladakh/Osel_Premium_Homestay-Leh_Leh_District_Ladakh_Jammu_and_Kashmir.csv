ladakh,Osel is the best homestay in leh and a better place in the land of the mountains. It is around 3kms from the airport and a little inside the narrow lanes of Leh which is quite reachable.   Rooms are massive and spacious. Lots of storage space available and rooms are lit with ample sunlight. Towels are available and do carry bathing essentials.   Food is delicious and charged at a nominal price. Complementary breakfast available. The common eating area is so beautiful so as the balconies. Do not miss the different types of tea. The host will shower you with loads of food.   kunsang is an amazing host and makes you feel at home. She is always sweet and takes cares of you so well. She is a sweet person and powered with knowledge. She is always available for a chat.  Overall:  Rooms,Kaanchan R,/Profile/KaanchanR1,"Chennai, India",50

ladakh,"While booking for your stay at any place, you have two options - Hotel or Homestay. We usually prefer hotels because we skeptical about living in someone's house and worrying for hospitality etc. We were in the same situation while planning for our Leh trip. We thought to try homestay for the first time and opted for Osel, going by its reviews.  And Yolaa! I couldn't have stayed at a better place in the land of mountains. Osel has the best of both industries - hotel and homestay. It has best hospitality and perfect homely feeling. Osel is around 3 KMs from airport and a little inside the narrow lanes of Leh but reachable easily.  Rooms are very pretty and spacious. Lots of storage space available along with ample sunlight. Bathrooms are clean, big enough and 24 hours hot water",ResfeberInMumbai,/Profile/ResfeberInMumbai,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"We stayed at Osel Premium for 8 days and the experience was simply beautiful, not a single moment inside the house you'd feel you're away from home.   The house has some beautiful woodwork everywhere along  with common balcony to sit and view the mighty mountains. The rooms are VERY spacious, luxurious and clean with all amenities one would require. The bathroom is even a step ahead. You wouldn't feel discomfort for a moment. The house's location near the main market of the city so there isn't any problem to get access to anything.   They serve one of the best tea I had in Leh and each and every meal was perfect and accommodating to any taste.   An overall 10/10.",Ankit P,/Profile/ankitp483,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"We stayed at this place for 3 days during our recent Leh trip. It's a beautiful homestay located in the centre of the city. The rooms are nice and big and receive ample amount of sunlight which is a big relief. There is a common room which has a attached balcony from where you can enjoy views of Mt. Stok Kangri. Kunzeng and her family were a great host. They stay downstairs and they ensure excellent hospitality with a completely homely feel. Breakfast was very tasty. We enjoyed ladakhi bread and ladakhi butter tea. These 3 days were like a ladakhi culture tour for us - place, food, ambience and conversations with kunzeng about ladakhi people and their life. Before going to a place, I typically spend lot of time in researching about places to stay. I'll not need to do that in my",Traveler185938,/Profile/Traveler185938,"Kolkata, India",50
ladakh,"Wonderful hosts, well lit with sunlight & a beautiful 'modern & traditional' home. And the best of it is their hospitality. From yummy & fresh food, deserts and drinks round the clock, and ensuring you are warm, to arranging for you to see the best sights in Leh and experience their culture. Having tea at their balcony & waking up to the beautiful Himalayas is something you should not miss. I had visited Leh before during 2012. However, i can vouch that this place is the best and if at all if i visit again, i know where to go. No double thoughts. Enjoy your best stay here :-)",Darshan S,/Profile/DarshanS1986,,50
ladakh,"I had an amazing time with the Chospa's at the Osel Premium Homestay. They are wonderful hosts and they have a beautiful well designed home to compliment their hospitality. From yummy food, deserts and drinks round the clock, to ensuring you are warm, to arranging for you to see the best sights in Leh and experience their culture, they went out of the way to make my stay in Leh like time with family! I can't wait to go back to see them!",emptygeorge,/Profile/emptygeorge,,50
ladakh,"It was our first trip to Leh with family and friends. A friend recommendation made us to stay at Osel. We stayed here for almost a week and each day stay was very comfortable and enjoying. Room quality is not less than any 4 star hotel. The aesthetics of the room have been taken care properly. Rooms are spacious and equipped with all the facilities like LED, Wardrobes, Sofa, wooden work etc. The bed was very comfortable and cosy. After a tiring day we always felt like returning to the homestay as early as possible because of the comfort the room provided. One can stare at  Stok Kangri ranges for hrs from the terrace and balcony. The views are breathtaking. Food: the food was really delicious. Infact we made a point during our entire stay there that we should have dinner and",piyush_kothari65,/Profile/piyush_kothari65,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"I happened to stay accidentally when i had no roof at leh.  The Offer of hostess Kunzang at last minute without prior confirmation could not be expressed in words.  If a word is used then its just heartwarming and gratitude. That was the moment i felt at home.  The luxury encapsulates each step at home and left me scared of price which isn't my cup of cake of staying luxuriously.   The warmth of family needs to be mentioned.  Amma Ley of Kunzang, the warmth shown to me by her was none short of my mom. Could see herself as in the care of my mom.  I wondered why the staff had so much warm smile to offer always.  The Berry juice offered for our rejuvenation is something i shall remember for ever. And dinner when we were so late and hadn't confirmed before and they prepared for us.
