ladakh,Great location. Lovely gardens to relax and have a meal in. Very friendly staff. Enjoyed a nice meal in the restaurant. Right next to the Monastery. Good size room. Would go back again and stay for longer.,hpmin,/Profile/hpmin,"Gryon, Switzerland",40
ladakh,"We spent a night here last month and we had a great stay. The rooms are cozy and comfortable, they have a really nice garden outside with apple and apricot trees, a very sweet dog called Sheru and they serve delicious food. We were even lucky to sample some homemade chang here. They even have wifi! (not that you would need to use it in such a beautiful place). The only critique I have is that the bathrooms could use some serious cleaning.",Karen D,/Profile/H9181POkarend,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Eine stilvolle Unterkunft außerhalb vom umtriebigen Dorfzentrum, daher sehr ruhig. Der gepflegte Garten ist voller Obstbäume und Blumen und bietet auch Platz zum Sitzen. Es gibt auch einen kleinen Privattempel, den auch die Gäste zum Meditieren benutzen dürfen.  Wir hatten ein großes sehr sauberes Eckzimmer im 1. Stock mit Bad und guten Matrazen. Zum Frühstück gab's saftige fluffige Pancakes mit Aprikosen aus dem Garten. Ebenso lecker war das ladakhische Abendessen mit Gemüse auf eigenem (organischen) Anbau! Die Gastgeber - ein älteres Ehepaar - sind sehr nett und aufmerksam und sprechen Englisch.",fam-bu,/Profile/fam-bu,Berlin,40
ladakh,A perfect place to rest your bones after a long tiring journey from Srinagar.  The owner personally takes care of all the needs and has a beautiful vegetable garden from where he will personally pick the freshest vegetables to prepare.,Sharad S,/Profile/SharadShah,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",40
ladakh,We had a very nice accommodation at this family run place.The rooms are simple but clean.We had our own bathroom with a working warm shower. We got a typical ladakhi dinner and also the breakfast was authentic and good. but best part is enjoying the view from the garden to the mountains while you're eating.It only takes 5 min by walk to get to the monastery and some shops and restaurants. We wished we could stay longer- so this hotel is absolutely to recommend.,KaiT1972,/Profile/KaiT1972,"Lund, Sweden",50
ladakh,It was great staying in the Choskor family run guest house.  We were made very welcome and the owner took us to the road end on the morning of our departure and waited with us to make sure that we caught a bus to our next destination.,Indianna108,/Profile/Indianna108,"kendal, cumbria",50
ladakh,"We did not actually stay at the hotel but we had lunch there. The owners were kind enough to prepare a very nice lunch for us, even though we were in the middle of the afternoon, that says a lot about their sense of hospitality in general. The place was peaceful and well maintained.  We also met someone who did stay and she was very happy.",jgguillemaud,/Profile/jgguillemaud,"New Delhi, India",50
