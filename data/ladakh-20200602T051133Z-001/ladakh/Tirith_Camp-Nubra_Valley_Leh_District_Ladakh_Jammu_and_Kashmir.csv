ladakh,"A quite and serene place where one would like to spend some time.  The tents here are cosy, neat and clean. The temperatures do not plummet a lot during summer time.  Best part is, you will get clean toilets and hot water for bath, and that too with a shower!!  The staff here is a very helpful, courteous and hospitable. If you are with a group, they can organize a very good bonfire.  The food here is amazing. They predominantly cook whatever they can grow in their vegetable gardens. If you want something specific, help them to get the stuff from Tirith village.  One of the best camp sites in that region. Surely, a must visit place.",Ashish Dugar,/Profile/ashishd131,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,We stayed at the camp for one night. We were a group of 10 so we had five tents to us. There was no other guests in the camp  so we had the whole camp to ourselves.  The tents were fairly done. The hospitality was brilliant. The food was the best we had in nubra valley. The staff is very cordial and always ready to help.  Great stay in Nubra!!!,Nikhil Agrawal,/Profile/advnikhilagrawal,,50
ladakh,"I visited this place with 2 of my friends. This is a really nice place to stay while you visit nubra valley from leh. We reached there 8 in the night. But still the Manager provided us with a comfortable tent in reasonable price with dinner and breakfast included. If you book in advance, you'll get all the meals plus evening and morning tea. They arrange a bonfire for you too which makes the night. All in all, it is a wonderful camp and it'll be a great experience to stay here. Manager Sir and the staff are kind and helpful.

Tents were neat and clean with hot water available in toilets all the time. We were the only people staying so food was served at our preferable time and was simply delecious.
