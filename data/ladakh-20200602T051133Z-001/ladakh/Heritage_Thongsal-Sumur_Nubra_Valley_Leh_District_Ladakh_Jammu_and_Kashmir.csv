ladakh,"While most of the other such camp resorts are in Hunder, this one is far away from that crowd. We went towards Hunder to enjoy the ATV ride, Bacteria Camel ride and visit Diskit Monastery and then came to Heritage Thongsal driving back towards Leh from Hunder upto the T point from where towards right is Leh and towards left is Tirith, where the resort is located. Its a beautiful location, near a river stream and the sight around was definately refreshing and picturesque. The tents are amongst greenery and there are farms next to the resort area. There is absolute peace and tranquility around.  Tents are basic in nature (as expected) but comfortable and have hot (during mornings) and cold running waters. They have provision for bon-fire post dinner, beneath a big green tree which",Anupam Sharma,/Profile/anupam812,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"We travelled from Leh to Nubra covering all the monasteries and the Hot Water Springs and by the time we reached the resort, it was almost Sunset. It was a pleasant entry with Lush Green surroundings. The tents are well maintained and the Food Court is very nice. The night we reached, we were the only group and they arranged a Camp Fire (for an extra cost). The food served was hot and the taste was very good. The night view of the clear sky with stars and the surrounding mountains is splendid. In the morning we had a walk around and a good photo session. The actual plan was to stay for two nights here and travel to Pangong. But the Pangong road was closed because of the damage caused by the rains and we have to make it for 1 night only.  In the entire trip, this is the only",RaghuNadhKasturi,/Profile/RaghuNadhKasturi,"Hyderabad, India",50
ladakh,The camp is excellent provided by bountiful nature and you will really experience bliss in the midst of snow covered mountains. The zip's of most of the tents don't work so night's u will get cold wind.,jvd4801,/Profile/jvd4801,"Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,"Had a comfortable one night stay in these tents among the mountains. It was quiet, as we 5 only were there. The common room had carrom as well as equipment for table tennis. In absence of electricity and mobile network, we spent our evening playing those. After an early dinner, we retired to our respective tents (booked 2). Food was hot, however tasted a bit like those ready-to-eat packs. It wasn't bad though. The nights were windy and it was quite a scary experience, sleeping in a tent amidst the lonely mountains. Beds were comfortable and the blankets warm enough. Next morning, we freshened up in the attached bathrooms. We did receive warm water from the solar heater. And then photography... Morning was beautiful. I wish we could have spent one more day there. PS: There was",Abhijeet Kumar,/Profile/lazywriterabhi,"Bettiah, India",40
ladakh,The location of the property is excellent as its surrounded by mountains. This is a tented accommodation with in room washrooms. The staff was very warm and welcoming. The food was good and also the way the property is build is excellent. We had a very private kind of experience as were in a group of 12 and the hotel staff took great care of all us.,840gabie,/Profile/840gabie,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"The location of the camp is perfect which treats you with picturesque views .. Amazing view of sunrise and sunset. The major turn down was the hospitality part of the stay. Inspite of repeated complains from all the guests, the manager failed to comply to any requests. The bed in the tent is so small , making it hard for tall people to fit in. Our tent had major problems regarding hot water in the morning .. They have a solar heater which did the job but somehow the hot water was unable to reach our tent ..we had to fetch water from outside by dismantling the pipe connection. We also had a major problem regarding the main zip of our tent. The zip failed to function properly. Inspite of other tents being empty the staff did not offer to shift us to another tent with better",Riddhi86,/Profile/Riddhi86,"Mumbai, India",20
ladakh,"Located in Sumur in the Nubra Valley, this property is straight out of a fairy tale book. There are camps that are rather stylist and with all the amenities that one could put some of what you have back home to shame. You can be assured that you won't experience any form of discomfort whatsoever. There's a solar heater that ensures patrons have hot water too.",NomadicThunker,/Profile/NomadicThunker,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"This tented accomodation is situated in a village called tirith. Which is about half an hour far from the famous sand dunes and camel rides place. Though there are places available near the sand dunes, camel rides... But those are over crowded kind. But this place offers solitude. These are tented accommodations surrounded by mountains from all sides. You happen to see milky way at night. The staff is too generous to provide with extra blankets, hot water bottles etc. Mr. Subhash the manager was polite and helpful. We stayed there in mid september and had 3 tents with a group of 9 members.",rohitnarangynr,/Profile/rohitnarangynr,yamuna nagar,40
ladakh,"nestled in tirith away from the crowded Hundar camps  this camp was our favourite from the Ladakh trip.. we also got to sumoor and panamik hot springs instead of just hundar due to the camps location..the staff is helpful and well trained..  liked the non veg food here a lot.. Mr Subhash the manager  made our stay really comfortable.. they also have a variety of recreational activities like ping pong, carrom etc available here highly recommend it to anyone who wants an authentic camp experience in Ladakh. Moreover for its facilities it is not costly at all. ",9travellingpants,/Profile/9travellingpants,"New Delhi, India",50

ladakh,"I visited tirith camp aka thongsal camp in mid june, stay was great and peaceful, food was great too and location in near to nubra valley and sand dunes hunder (approx 40 min drive). Tent is big with separate bathroom running hot water. Staff is ready to help you every time you need.but i think one night stay price is bit high compare to others.

ladakh,On your way back after visiting Hunder sand dunes spend the night here. The camp was deserted as we were the only occupants. The supervisor mentioned that they do have group bookings which would make it more lively. The staff was very attentive and treated us to a good dinner and the food was very fresh. They also had cards and carom board to while away the time. The breakfast in the morning was also good.,wildcatgirly,/Profile/wildcatgirly,Abu Dhabi,40
