ladakh,"Stayed at Lharjey Resort on 18 Aug 2018, while on Ride of My Life in Ladakh.  Sumur, is a location less known to travelers. That is the good part. Resort location is very good, views that you see are amazing. The setting of the rooms is also very good, you have a cluster of 2/3 rooms, dining area is different. Ample space for parking. Lush green every where, and you see the Himalaya as you step out of the room. Sun flower plants, blossoming apricot tree - which attracted bees. Clean water streams from the glaciers. What else do you need?  Food was good, fresh apricot and apple fruit grown at the resort were served. Early morning tea was served in the room. Hot water was available.  Great experience - see the pictures!!",VJ1974,/Profile/VJ892147,India,40
ladakh,"In order to explore the Nubra valley Eastern side, I visited Sumoor village and already had a recommendation of Lharjey Resort being a really nice and cozy place to stay (they started operation this year itself). I liked the place so much that decided to take a lot of pictures and write a review :)   I want this review to be short and let pictures do the talking :)  If you enjoy my review, I would appreciate a ""Thumbs up""  Cheers !",Rahul D,/Profile/dobhal87,"New Delhi, India",50
