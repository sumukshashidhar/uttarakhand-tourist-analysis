ladakh,Given the generally low quality of rooms whatÂ´s better then spending few days in well furnished tends with hot water shower private bath and so on? The owner is very friendly and will help in case of need. Great place,Alex W,/Profile/alexw930,,40
ladakh,We stopped at west Ladakh camps for tent experience . This west Ladakh camp was at a height along Indus River. We got a tent near to the river. It was a room and an attached bathroom. There were no heaters and it was very cold. But we were provided enough blankets to suffice.   There were some families too and a big group along with us. Dining hall was common . Dinner tasted good. We ate our dinner and sat outside near river under star studded sky until we slept.   Advice: please check zip of tent so you can ask for room change( one or two zips for tents were not working when we were there). ,Preethi_nalam,/Profile/Preethi_nalam,"Hyderabad, India",40
ladakh,Unfortunately we were the only guests at the time but we got the VIP treatment. We enjoyed sitting under the abricot tree with coffee and cookies.  Nice clean tent with good beds. In the morning the young man who served us brought a bucket of warm water so no shower. Tastful meal was served in the evening. Breakfast we could order whatever we want.,Lojan V,/Profile/LojanV,"Roermond, The Netherlands",50
ladakh,Good location clean but less occupancy. If you are in group than good or you may be alone at camp site. Food good . No watchmen or security. Hot water provided on request . Not on river bank as displayed in management photo. Needs to improve lot.,rajiv m,/Profile/rajivm518,,20
ladakh,"Had a unpleasant experience during our stay at West Ladakh camp. We were the sole occupant despite that the staff provided poor to average service. There was no electricity supply during the whole period of our stay with no source to recharge mobile or the camera battery. In the absence of any light, it became an adventure to reach dinning hall from our tent in the dark. The sole supporting staff expressed his helplessness to provide power supply as the generator was out of order for days. The tents were cramped with miniature beds with no hot water supply in the attached bathrooms. The staff said that they provide hot water supply only if the occupancy is good. The menu options were limited with average quality of meals prepared by the not so hygeinic cook. Surely, an avoidable",Navneet R,/Profile/NavneetR_12,"New Delhi, India",20
ladakh,"this camp is at a great location 75 km drive away from leh, me my family and kids had a wonderful stay here, the location is vast, indus river is just below huge area with lots of local fruit tree and, green vegetation, tents are net and clean staff are generous, they have only veg menu if you are non veg needs to inform the management before.",vikmumbai566,/Profile/vikmumbai566,"Goa, India",50
ladakh,"West ladakh camp in Ule was one of the finest and most comfortable stays in Ladakh's trip. Rating: 4/5 Pros:  1. Very peaceful and great location, Indus river flows beside the camp so u can actually hear its sound. 2. Very large and good tent with basic facilities. 3. Food was good. 4. People were courteous.   Cons:  1. Its not actually bad but maybe because we're the only ones in the camp so felt really alone, no one to talk to. 2. One of the opening chain of tent was not working that well.  But overall stay was really very good.",Somitk296,/Profile/Somitk296,"Pune, India",40
ladakh,"Three things made this overnight stop near Leh perfect for me: First, during a month of travelling in India, this was definitely the most comfortable bed I slept in; Second, the peacefulness and the quiet was a very welcome relief from the traffic and barking dogs which could be heard from all the more urban accommodations; Third, the atmosphere with apricot trees and the view of the Indus River was rather heavenly.  The food is good; the tents are clean; the staff is helpful and friendly. There are many interesting sites in the nearby area worth visiting. What more could one possibly want?",LobsangDolkar,/Profile/LobsangDolkar,"Halfmoon Bay, Canada",50
ladakh,"Coming from Canada, and used to minimalist camping, this was luxury. The fresh air, peaceful atmosphere and beautiful views made this a special stop on our tour out of Leh. The tents, well, really rooms, were very comfortable - proper beds with nice linens  and then the flush toilets were totally unexpected. The evening meal was lovely - just what we needed after a very full day. I found staff to be very sweet. We all giggled when two young gentlemen welcomed us with full tea service at our campsite - tablecloth, biscuits and hot tea. Definitely add this experience to your trip.",HannahBear2014,/Profile/HannahBear2014,Vancouver BC,50
ladakh,"We love staying here when we visit the famous Alchi Gonpa and Rizong Gonpa.  This modern campsite is set in a beautiful apricot grove right along side the Indus River and just 2.5 hours from Leh.  The tents are spacious with modern bathrooms and the beds are wonderfully comfortable.  Communal dinning allows us to mingle with other visitors.  The food, served buffet style, is good and plentiful.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  Most of all we enjoy star-filled night sky, the wonderful silence of no dogs barking and the rush of the nearby Indus River.  The perfect get-away from Leh.",Anthro_mom2012,/Profile/Anthro_mom2012,"Brighton, New York",50
ladakh,"We stayed here for a night enroute to Leh. It was more an acclimatization stop but the beauty is breathtaking. The tents are cozy with an attached washroom and the staff is helpful. We drove around till Alchi and crossed the rickety suspension bridge at Lardhoo.....great experience!   Food was decent- nothing spectacular, but then we weren't expecting gourmet cuisine either :)",manisha_kothari,/Profile/manisha_kothari,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,Lovely location at ulletokpo near riverside. Tents are very good with Double bed clean and comfortable but are with very low light. Food was not so good for us. Staff was nice and helpful.. River view from was wonderful from the top.. Nice to stay and must have camping experience in ladakh while journey to lamayuru from leh..,yeshamumbai,/Profile/yeshamumbai,"Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,"Stayed 2 nights -- lovely spot that feels like a remote retreat, even though it's conveniently located on the main highway part way between Leh and Lamayuru. Great location as a base for day hikes or road excursions along the Leh/Lamayuru corridor. Staff were very kind and attentive, and the tents are clean and comfortable. Wonderful view of the river from the site. Highly recommended.",Mati B,/Profile/veryhappycamper2013,"Toronto, Canada",50
ladakh,"Although this was not the camp we thought we had booked (some sort of misunderstanding between us and the agent somewhere), it didn't really make any difference to us. We arrived at the camp in the early afternoon and were immediately offered lunch. Food is served in what appears to be a newish purpose built place with a buffet laid out one end and a long table with enough room for about 20 diners the others. As there was only us staying, the buffet appeared as containers on the table. The food was good (vegetarian only) and plentiful.   There are quite a few tents within the camp, but they are nicely spread out between boulders and trees so it doesn't feel cramped. The camp grounds occupy a small strip of land between the main road and the river. On both majestic mountains rise",GreteHoward,/Profile/GreteHoward,"Bristol, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,a beautiful tented property amidst the apricot orchard. they have 2 bed and 3 bed tents. overall i think 20 altogether. we stayed in a 3 bed accommodation. the tent was spacious. the view from the tent was breath taking. the staff was courteous. the washroom was very clean.   the buffet dinner they served was very nice. they had a large group of foreigners occupying the other tents for night. they were a boisterous group playing loud music till late night. that was little unnerving. otherwise its a peaceful quiet place with all the natural elements around you. special mention of the owner (sorry name forgotten) she was very apologetic about the groups boisterousness  and went out of way to offer us a very peaceful dinner in the morning. .,margdarshak,/Profile/margdarshak,"Chandigarh, Chandigarh, India",40
ladakh,A comfortable place to stay overnight on the Leh-Kargil Road. Apricot and Apples trees can be seen in the area. River Indus is just next to this place and provides breathtaking views of the river in the deep gorge. The silence is broken by the roar of river and it is very breezy near the river shore. Average food served in the restaurants. Take a walk on the main road and cross the river on a bridge built by locals.,MahipVyas,/Profile/MahipVyas,"San Francisco, California",50
ladakh,"Nice location, slightly remote, on the way to moon Land / Lamayuru  Good staff, co-operative and helpful. Tents are good, with attached toilet. Hot water made available on demand. Electricity is available only from 7 pm to 11 pm River rafting facility very near by.  over all good experience.",Aniruddha A,/Profile/327aniruddhaa,"London, United Kingdom",30
ladakh,"Tents are reasonably nice with attached toilet. You will get hot water every time you will demand. Food is decent, you can not expect more in an isolated place.  The scenery is great as you can see the indus river just beside it. It is an ideal place for big groups. Beds are not comfortable but you cant expect more in a tent. Keep this place away if you are with the kinds. Attractions such as monasteries and moon land escape are near by.",Ritwik P,/Profile/RitwikP,"Muzaffarpur, India",40
ladakh,"We had four tents for six people, each with own attached facilities (including western-style toilet, shower and wash basin.) The tents are eight-sided, but fully curtained right around on the inside, with a white scolloped ceiling, creating a wonderful cosy feeling. Cement floor is  fully carpeted, two comfortable beds, warm quilts, a solar powered reading lamp. Wonderful place, on the banks of the Indus River, just to get away from it all. Food (included in price) was adequate but bigger tour groups could consider sending a catering manager ahead with extra supplies, to negotiate with the knowledgeable and very willing cook and his team. We spent two nights, after doing some white river rafting, being a party ranging in age from 7 to 69 years. Would recommend West Ladakh Camp",ElmarieTshwane,/Profile/ElmarieTshwane,"Pretoria, South Africa",50
ladakh,"This is no mere 'camp site'.  The tents are well constructed, off the ground, and complete with private bathrooms, warm quilts, and comfortable cots.  Sitting high above the Indus, it is truly a breath of fresh air after working in Leh.  Hike, take photos of the natural surroundings, or just sit outside comfortably reading a book.  A wonderful experience!  A breath-taking ride from Leh.",Anthro_mom2012,/Profile/Anthro_mom2012,"Brighton, New York",50
ladakh,"I am in Leh doing a project for the summer and have changed my contact lenses 3 times in 1 month from the dust and pollution! I was looking for a quick, quiet and scenic getaway from the tourist season and someone suggested West Ladakh Camp. It was so much better than I ever expected!!! I didn't have much time so it was the perfect retreat - a quick trip to Alchi along the way and then an overnight in the lovely, comfortable tent camp at Ulletokpo. No permits, no haggling for a seat in a shared taxi - easy busride, super food, great little day hikes to Mangyu in Rizdong Monastery. VERRRY comfortable beds!! I highly recommend this as a quick get away from Leh or even to break up the trip to Lamayuru or surrounding areas.",DebiG2000,/Profile/DebiG2000,"Minato, Japan",50
ladakh,"It's a beautiful location to camp during your trip to Ladakh, I had a wonderful time here.  Beautiful location surrounded by willow & apricots tree. Good service, good food.  The tents are neat and clean with attached bath, hot & cold shower. If you have more time at the camp then don't miss the hike up to mangyu & Rizdong village.",JasonDelhi,/Profile/JasonDelhi,Delhi,40
