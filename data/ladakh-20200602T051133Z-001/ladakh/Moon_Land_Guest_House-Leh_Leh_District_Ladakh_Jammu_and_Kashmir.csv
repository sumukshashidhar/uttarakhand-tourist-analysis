ladakh,"I have stayed 3 night in these guest house. Nice location, Nice and spacious rooms. Only problem is the owner family. They have been kind only at our arrival, than it was like if they were doing us a favour to host us. I asked for a towel.... No! I asked to clean the shared bathroom and again, no.  I guess they do not need money so they don't really care.  Apart this, if you don't mind the unfriendliness.... All is kind if ok",nina,/Profile/gianfranc01971,,10

ladakh,"Rooms are nice in accordance with the price offered. Its just meters away from the airport. The care taker 'Phuntsog  is also very nice guy. The windows offer a very nice view. Rooms are a bit old but come on you're in ladakh, isn't that a big irony. ",Raghav2995,/Profile/Raghav2995,"Dehradun, India",30
ladakh,"I stayed here with my friends the entire time I was in Leh/Ladakh. The couple who owns Moon Land are wonderful- absolutely adorable and very caring. We stayed in the rooms with the attached bathrooms and the rooms were very very clean. Great location- it was just off the main bazar road, we could even see the Leh palace from our window. The room was 500 rupees for two people. They offered us tea and cookies while we chatted one morning. They filled our water bottles with filtered water countless times - so many times that we felt annoying about it, but they were very nice the entire time. When one of my friend's was sick, they offered her soup. Their son also owns a trekking/tour company so any questions we had about where to go or how much it cost we were able to find out fast.",Michelle F,/Profile/michellef330,"San Diego, California",50
