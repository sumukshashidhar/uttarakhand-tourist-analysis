ladakh,The only reason I loved the place is because of the location. The main market is there. Bank and other major hotels are at a walking distance. Services were just perfect and staff was very helpful in organizing some of the rides.,Alfredo812,,"Miami, Florida",40
ladakh,"Its a wonderful clean place. The owner whose an aged man lives right at the property and runs it, the food is cooked by 2 Nepali Chaps who are really good at it. The place is very clean, and definitely worth the stay in an area like Sakti that doesn't have a lot!",Travel_amazingly_007,,Indiana,50
