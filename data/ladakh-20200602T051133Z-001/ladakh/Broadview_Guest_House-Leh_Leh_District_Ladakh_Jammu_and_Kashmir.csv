ladakh,"Absolutely horrible hotel. We had booked to stay here for 5 nights, but ended up moving out after just 2 days. Pathetic staff. No hot water provided in tap and they expect the guests to carry hot water in buckets to their rooms. Also room has no basic amenities. Complete no no. Bathroom windows don't close and the staff behave as if you are making a mistake by complaining about the lack of facilities. ",Kamna P,/Profile/101kamnap,"Mumbai, India",10
