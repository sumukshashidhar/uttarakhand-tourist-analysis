Hot water is available because our trip is in 5 Oct this year, it's quite cold. The hotel's owner is really friendly, kind, always smile and ready to help when you need. He helped us to buy food, fruit for the first day in Leh. When we could not call a taxi to the center at 8pm under a cold  weather, he drove us to drop there free of charge. The other people who working in the kitchen,... are really friendly, helpful too.

I made a special request and the owner made sure they had no trouble at all, making reservations for cabs and sightseeing. They stayed there for about 10 days and absolutely loved the place. Small water stream behind the hotel made it a much more wonderful experience. The food was extremely delicious. Market is very close. Rooms are neat and well maintained. Would definitely recommend.

I never even spoke to the owner - Mr. Sonam. But there was an unmistakable undercurrent of warmth that I could distinctly feel. So, this time even before I decided to go to Leh I was sure of one thing - I was going to stay in Hotel Asia under the guidance of Sonamji.   And rather I was mistaken. He was not warm. He, in fact, took care of us (me, my wife and my 8-year-old son) like his own family members. In fact, his hospitality and warmth began from even before we landed in",Aditya N,/Profile/adimysorean,"Bengaluru, India",50

The hospitality they provided was top notch. You will get warm tap water in the bathrooms most of the time. Breakfast is complimentary and the food is extremely delicious. Also there is a Tatasky DTH connection in each room. The owner is extremely polite and friendly.

Rooms were big and spacious and had a pretty great balcony view with a small river outside of it with a cozy feel and even bathrooms were bigger it was such a comfortable n cozy treat after a long tiring ride.

The hotel is located on the changspa road and is well connected to the Leh market as well as the Airport. The rooms are decent with a river flowing by just next to the Hotel. The food is average but you'll have plenty of options around the Place. World Garden Cafe and KC corner is highly recommended. The staff is good and the facilities available in room are average. You may find it difficult to have hot water in room sometimes. All in all it's a decent choice as you'll hardly get to spend time in the hotel and you'll mostly be travelling.

Earlier, I had called a number of registered tour operators and hotels at Leh and they all advised me not to visit Leh during that time of the year.   However, when I called Mr. Sonam Angchuk the owner of Hotel Asia, Leh sometime in the month of July 2012 he sounded very positive and advised me just to bring as much as warm clothes as possible and leave the rest to him. I had then itself made up my mind to stay at Hotel Asia, Leh.  Thereafter, Mr. Angchuk and I have regularly exchanged views over the phone which helped me a lot in deciding my essential luggage.

ladakh,"Stayed at Hotel Asia as part of a group trip of 16 people organized by ""Connect With Himalaya"" (company run by Gaurav Punj) during the second week of July 2012. Reached the hotel after a grueling road trip from Kargil, to find dirty rooms and no hot water. Either Gaurav Punj hadn't informed Sonam Anchu of our arrival or Sonam Anchu chose not to provide us hot water that evening. Hot water wasn't available for the next 5 days that we stayed at the hotel; at best we got barely warm water really early in the morning. We were booked in the 'Old wing' by ""Connect With Himalaya"" - the reason being that Gaurav Punj and Hotel Asia have been connected for the last 6 years and Gaurav believes that this wing is 'quaint family style guest house'. It was hardly a family style hotel - Sonam",638BB,/Profile/638BB,"New Delhi, India",10

ladakh,"Looking over the past reviews, I see I have a very different take on this place. First of all its not a B&B; its a fairly large hotel, and fairly impersonal. I stayed four nights and thought it was fine for its price range, but hardly as wonderful as others make it out to be.  First the good. The room was large, clean, and had wonderful big windows to let in light. The hotel is in a very quiet location, and on nicely kept grounds. There are a couple of nice patios to sit out on, take breakfast, etc. The price seemed fair for this sort of place; I paid Rs700 but I'm sure I could have paid Rs600 if I'd cared enough to bargain.  The bad (or anyway, less good). I was there in mid-May and the season hadn't quite started yet, so the owner hadn't turned on the hot water!
