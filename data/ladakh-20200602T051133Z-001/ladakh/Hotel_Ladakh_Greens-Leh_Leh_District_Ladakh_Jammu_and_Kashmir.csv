ladakh,"We stayed at ""Ladakh Greens"" for 7 days. It was recommended by my father due to a previous stay there. We were overwelmed: 1) the rooms and bathrooms are excellent, spacey and clean 2) the food they serve was the best we had in Leh, every single dish (for both breakfast and dinner) was made freshly (even the noodels are handmade and the salad out of the garden), 3) the staff is supet friendly, the hostility stunning and they really do care for you (when i had to check my inhured knee, the hitel manager spent 3 hours with me to get to see a doctor at hospital), also when it comes to recommendations for activities in or around Leh. We strongly recommend this place as we felt like home there. ",randomrouter,/Profile/randomrouter,,50

Around a kilometer walk from the main market, this hotel is slightly inside from the Fort Road and have a narrow entrance, but as soon as you enter the property you start liking it. Surrounded by greens with views of snow covered mountains in between and birds chirping around gives you an opportunity to relax in the open. Rooms: Nice neat n clean rooms with Tata Sky and LED TV, Heater, LED lantern, nice and comfortable beds, running hot water supply and clean bathrooms.

ladakh,"I travelled to India for the first time with my partner this year. We stayed at Hotel Ladakh Greens for three nights (the entire length of our stay in Leh).  The staff were very welcoming and polite. Our room was clean and comfortable. The initial main feature that we loved was the hotel garden - they have nice tables and chairs there where we were served a welcome cup of chai. They also have a friendly hotel cat who will come out to greet you.  WiFi was great under the circumstances (the Indian government has cut the main cable to Jammu & Kashmir). When you come to a place like Ladakh, though, if you come for the internet, you're coming for the wrong reason!  The food at Ladakh Greens was amazing.

The hotel is located close to the main town centre, where all of the market stalls are held. The staff at Hotel Ladakh Greens were all so welcoming, polite and hospitable. The service was fantastic. The one thing I will give a special mention to is the food - it was made fresh for each meal and was some of the best food I had in my travels.

Lovely outside garden setting where we enjoyed breakfast in the mornings. Our room was basic but comfortable. The staff were very attentive and helpful. We had dinner at the hotel on the first night and were impressed by the food – the momos with mint sauce were delicious as was the garlic cheese naan.

The portions for breakfast were large but those of the meals relatively smaller but the staff do make it a point to let you know about it. The rooms weren't really large but that did not matter much considering that we were out the whole day. The hotel is located a little inside from the road so there wasn't any disturbance from vehicles except for the barking dogs at night.

The manager is a very cleaver and sneaky person and kept on lying.   Initially when we arrived at the hotel the manager  provided us a single bed very small room with hardly any space for our luggage even though we had reservations for a double deluxe room for four of us.  He said this is the only room that he can provide for us. According to him it was next to impossible for him to give us a little bigger room since this was their biggest room in the hotel.

The sophisticated yet simple owner family takes personal interest in assisting the guests in every way for sight seeing, food, medical help, local traditions etc. Within a couple of hours, we were so happy over all that we cancelled the pre booked hotel located in the bazaar, for the remaining days.",Dilip C,/Profile/DilipC149,"Navi Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Ladakh Greens was our home away from home in Leh. The ever smiling hospitality from everyone, the superb food and nice and cozy rooms were an absolute delight. Whenever we returned from one of our exhausting trips (Nubra, Pangong, etc.) the thought that we are going back to Ladakh Greens made us feel like we are coming home.  Everyone at the hotel were always ready to help and did so with important information and superlative service.  If you want to stay in a calm setting while being a 10 minutes walk from the main market, this is the place for you!! Raj",GREENS103,/Profile/GREENS103,"Leh, Jammu and Kashmir, India",50
