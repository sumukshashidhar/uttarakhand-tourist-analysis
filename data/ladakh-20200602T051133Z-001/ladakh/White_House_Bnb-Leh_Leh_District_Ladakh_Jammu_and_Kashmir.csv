ladakh,"Hi Folks, Me and my wife have visited this place as a bag packer post getting recommendation from the Cab Driver dated 19th May, It seems that there is some renovation is going on as they are bringing in some multi cuisine restaurant which as per them is going to be live from 20 June approx.. The Hotel Manager Mr. Kalanga & the property owners Mr. Sumit & Mr Rajesh have shown a good example of hospitality, as we were visiting this place for the first time & they have guided us about Do's & Dont's which has actually helped us making this trip comfortable and enjoyable.  Top of it they have upgraded us to next set of category FOC.  Rooms are clean & beautifully designed, have seen lots of Walking Customer entering in the hotel & booking the rooms...Washroom is beautifully designed",Rishabh Jain,/Profile/rishabhjbom,,50
ladakh,We(me and my sister) stayed at this Bnb for two days in Sep 2018.. We had landed in Leh early morning and Leh seemed to be closed in the early morning..Our driver for the airport recommended hotel tsokar..but tsokar was full when we reached and we had to hunt for some accommodation.. There is a lane opposite to hotel tsokar consisting of guest houses and homestays wherein we bumped into two women.. i asked them if they cud recommend some option when they said they were staying at Whitehouse bnb and that it just provides basic accomodation and nothing above dat... (not even a glass of water.. is what they said) we went to have a look at the rooms....the rooms were decent.. It was a small cozy room with a bed with clean linens.. The bathroom was big and clean and we were said that,rmarkar,/Profile/rmarkar,"Thane, India",30
