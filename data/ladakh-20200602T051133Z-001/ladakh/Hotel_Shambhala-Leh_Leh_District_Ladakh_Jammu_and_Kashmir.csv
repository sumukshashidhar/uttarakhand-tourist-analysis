ladakh,Lovely hotel around 2km from the center of Leh. The hotel has a serene garden where they sometimes offer breakfast or BBQ. Food is awesome and inlcudes western style breakfast and ladaky/indian style dinner/lunch.  Staff is super friendly and helpful. A free shuttle service to Leh center is available.  The rooms come with western style bathrooms and modern facilities. ,Norbu,/Profile/norbuflow,"Singapore, Singapore",50

ladakh,I have been visiting Leh since about 3 years now every season with my motorcycling group. It was the first time ever that we chose this property and I must say i do not regret my choice. The hotel is located a bit away from the Main Market which makes it a quieter option compared to other main stream options. The hotel has a decent parking space.  We found the rooms to be spacious enough with all the modern amenities one would need in a place like Leh. Over and all the rooms did have the heating system which i suppose can be turned on on special request or maybe during the winters. They also have the provision for the heated mattress system which was really helpful for those who had a sore back. A small but helpful feature in a place like Leh.  The hotel has a very nice garden,janaknmistry,/Profile/janaknmistry,"Mumbai, India",50

The manager is not professional and for any pity item he consults with the owner who is never available personally and discuss the matter on phone as her house is attached with the hotel. The hotel is in between air port (2-3 Km) and market (2Km) and for market you have to higher taxi. There is no any item of recreation. Cotton fiber is filled in the surrounding as cotton trees are grown in the lawn which create problem to one having breathing trouble.

If it's your first day in Leh, they request you to rest for the day so as to enjoy the rest of the Leh tour. They give personal attention if you are not feeling well due to high altitudes and arrange for cab to hospital if required.  The rooms are wooden, cozy and clean with all basic amenities. They are not typical lodge rooms. You get a feel of a hostel with a common hall to have chats if you are with big group.

Good service in rooms. TV channels include some English news channels.  Against: Dirty carpets in room. Old and tatty bathrooms (but reasonably clean). Poor restaurant food and service. Poor connectivity with wifi and limited to the reception area. Noisy toilet plumbing.  This place we found on recommendation from a fellow traveller.  It is not in the centre of town and is near to some an old fort now used as a military base so the area is lean and tidy as usual for military cantonments in India.

Our experience with Ladakh's scenic beauty has left a wonderful long lasting impact on our minds and we are back to our hometowns, sharing images and stories of our trip with our families and friends.  We have never missed an opportunity to mention to our folks, about the warmth and care, which your hotel staffs have provided us with, hence making this vacation both comfortable and memorable.  Looking forward to more Holidays with you guys in near future.",Megha B,/Profile/MeghaB_11,Delhi,40
ladakh,"We had an extremely relaxing holiday in Leh. The hotel is far away from the hustle and bustle of the city and is located in a beautiful , picturusque surrounding with lot of greenery and pastures.The owner Pinto Narboo and the manager Wangchuk run the place superbly with alot of personal care and attention. They were always available for great advice ,directions and all kinds of arrangements. The breakfast was excellent though overall the place can do better with improvement in food quality.The service was fantastic as good as anything we ever experienced.",Pomsingh,/Profile/Pomsingh,Gurgaon,50
ladakh,"Quality of food was terrible. Whether it be north indian or any other cuisine, it was really bad. Not sure what oil they used. The rooms were cold. The gas based heater in the room was not very effective always. Overall experience was poor for a welcom heritage hotel. Cant believe this one has a tie up with ITC???",sapm,/Profile/sapm,mumbai,20
ladakh,"It's a nice, above average hotel. The hotel staff was very courteous and helpful. Tehy arranged all the permits, taxi and also a camp stay for us. The food was not that great, just fine. You can tell the chef if you are looking for something specific. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The hotal has front lawns with hammock and garden chairs, you can spend good relaxing time there. It was a good value for money deal. I would recommend the hotel for people who are not looking for something lavish but comfortable.",Monics1712,/Profile/Monics1712,Delhi,40
ladakh,"When we booked, this was among the most expensive properties in Leh. We naturally assumed a minimal level of ""luxury"" in keeping with the price.   This hotel has doubtless seen much better days. But now, it qualifies not as a hotel. This is a guest house. You don't pay 5000 rupees a night to find that hot water is only available for limited hours in the morning and evening, never mind that you are acclimatising and need to be in your room all day.   The staff is warm and nice. Usually efficient. The manager - Mr. Wangchook, was the nicest part of our stay. His natural concern and helpfulness, his ability to understand and address the needs of all guests, is the one thing that keeps us from lambasting the hotel full on.   The rooms are basic - a little less than basic. They are",lonetraveler1,/Profile/lonetraveler1,Gurgaon,30
ladakh,"A friend recommended this hotel to us and we were not disappointed. The rooms were clean, the food was wholesome. They even packed picnic baskets for us on the days we were out sightseeing. We were a group of 4 girlfriends and they gave us two connected rooms which was perfect. The location was a little remote and we needed a car to get to / from the main market. The staff was very friendly and helpful.",sally_pgw,/Profile/sally_pgw,Mumbai,40
ladakh,"I stayed at this hotel with my husband  in September last year. We booked directly through the hotel site.The food was lovely, staff was very courteous, and the room was nice and clean with a view of the kitchen garden below,. Our sightseeing was all taken care of by the hotel staff. All in all a perfect holiday. We will definitely visit again!",Janvi Khanna,/Profile/squeekee123,india,50

ladakh,"Found Shambhala to be one of the most snug and comfortable places for stay at altitude like Leh.   The cheerfulness of the staff, specially Mr. Phuntsok Angchuk, the Manager, adds on to the memory ull keep forever.  The placement of the rooms around the garden works wonders as it gets all tourists in frequent contact with each other....UNLIKE AT ALL PLACES THAT IVE EVER STAYED IN!   The traditional event organised is a charm, which might not be witnessed otherwise, if Shambhala did not organise it.   The new wing constructed has spacious rooms with absolute modern architecture and facilities.   All in all.....me and my friends stay at SHAMBHALA.....was an engraved excellent memory! Would love to visit again!",rishikakalra,/Profile/rishikakalra,Ludhiana,50
ladakh,"The positives of the hotel are: - friendly and hardworking staff - good setting, with a nice garden and lounge, albeit a little far from the town centre - free drop service to the town centre; you have to return on your own and the taxi costs Rs 80 for the return trip - reasonably good food.  The negatives are: - dated rooms and toilets, urgently need refurbishment - limited timings for hot water - greater distance frrom the town centre as compared to other hotels.  The Welcomgroup affiliation is somehwat misleading as the hotel requires renovation.",Singhjee,/Profile/Singhjee,"Mumbai, India",20
ladakh,"My wife and I stayed at this place for 2 nights. The service was excellent, with the manager picking us up from the airport. The place is nice, though quite far (by Leh standards) from the town centre. The room was nothing spectacular. The staff is friendly. The food is good. But for the facilities offered, we felt that the place was terribly overpriced. There was hot water for only a couple of hours in the morning and evening. The carpet and curtains were worn out. Lunch and dinner were extremely expensive. In a couple of days, we shifted to a guest house right in the centre of town, for 1/10th the price!",wanderingskv,/Profile/wanderingskv,"Bengaluru, India",30
ladakh,This traditional Tibetan style hotel is in a lovely area just over 1km outside Leh. It is quiet and peaceful and has a nice garden in which one can laze in the sunshine in one of the very comfortable hammocks.   Our room was basic with a clean bathroom and clean sheets however the carpet and bedcovers were quite tattered and stained.   The hotel provides a free shuttle service to the centre of Leh however when we asked could they drop us to the airport on our last day they refused and said we would have to get a taxi. The trip to the airport from the hotel is shorter than the trip to the town centre so we were quite surprised that they wouldn't provide this service.  The staff were very helpful and always provided service with a genuine smile. The man who worked on the reception,JackIreland,/Profile/JackIreland,Ireland,30
ladakh,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Shambhala for four nights. The people are lovely, the situation is idyllic, the food was clean and tasty. They got our permits made for journeys to restricted areas, advised us on what to see and do and generally took great care of us. We are making plans to return to Leh in a few months' time and we will be staying at the Shambhala again. ",Isobella_D_N,/Profile/Isobella_D_N,"Singapore, Singapore",40
