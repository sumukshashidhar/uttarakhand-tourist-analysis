ladakh,"We had an amazing stay. They helped us in planning the entire trip and gave us a complete package including our stay at Nubra valley and transportation. The Ladakhi family experience was so amazing. The vegetables are also home grown and the food was simple and healthy. Friendly, helpful and caring staff. Also, the place was warm despite temperatures being close to -3¬∞C without using the heater. They have already been using the hotspot instead of wifi to fix the problem of the internet. The place is close to Leh Market and Shanti Stupa as well. Definitely recommended!",Shobit Singhal,,,50
ladakh,"We stayed at Silver Cloud for 2 nights. The hospitality of the place is rare. You will find home cooked food & that too delicious. The place is centrally heated, so in winters, it will be perfect to stay. Rooms are comfortable & clean! Mr. Stanzin also upgraded us to a beautiful room. Thanks to him!

ladakh,"Had a great stay at Silver cloud , family atmosphere , love , care and affection in equal measure . Only glitch is with WIFI only BSNL & Airtel works , close to leh marker , walk-able only 20 minutes , I came for the ladakh marathon and enjoyed the food and stay . I walked 1 hour every day . The hotel is very close to stanchi stupa only 10 minute walk . I loved the people , they are like family .",shajan samuel,,"Bengaluru, India",50

ladakh,"We stayed at Silver Cloud from 21 to 27 July. We were a group of 5 women. The best thing about Silver Cloud is the hospitality of the family this belongs to and the fact that they are always ready to help you. The owner Mr Stanzin is helpful and polite. The food is simple and homely and the rooms are comfortable. However it is 2 km from the market which might be inconvenient if you want to try food at other restaurants and wish to visit the market frequently. The area around SC is quiet and does not have any restaurants or shops. On the whole it was a comfortable stay, more like in a homestay rather than a hotel. I would like to mention 2 things that I was not happy about. First the driver that was provided to us. He was completely inexperienced, did not know how to behave with",Rijuta T,/Profile/rijutat2016,"Pondicherry, India",30

ladakh,"Booked this highly rated hotel from the US and paid a premium rate for the location ($90+/ room/ night). Booked the room based on lovely pictures. Communicated with the manager many times before arrival, talking about needs, etc. Upon arrival was given the two worst rooms on the property--no view, barely any sunlight, bathroom under construction. NOT the rooms I booked, not the photos given and not the pricey rooms I paid for. The only plus was the beds were comfy and that they gave towels! The hotel was fully booked, they were minting money and building a new wing. It was noisy on the property, the garden was not enjoyable. They treated their foreign guests much better than their Indian ones.  Waste of money and a scam.",Experience536798,/Profile/Experience536798,,10

I had done the booking based on very good reviews on tripadvisor and want to have a flavour of local ladhaki way of living, food, etc.   The sunrise / sunset rooms were very good (nice carvings, wooden look) ‚Äì where as the roof top rooms are much smaller and on the terrace. We did not take roof top rooms because terrace would have been very cold for us. We had bookings for consecutive days as 1 day in between we had planned to stay at Pangong, which we had to change last moment and make it only a day trip. So now we were struck with these bookings. So we decided to visit the property and talk directly to the owner. Stanzen",Anuja_Kothari,/Profile/Anuja_Kothari,"Mumbai, India",40

The rooms were stunning and were quite comfy (amazing beds). The people over at Silver Cloud are some of the kindest people I've ever met.

Our room had a balcony with a view of Leh Palace to our left and Shanti Stupa to our right. As we arrived on the 5th March, it was still really cold but with plenty of tea and good food we were happy despite overdoing things on the first day and having mild altitude sickness for 2 days as a result.   Padma's cooking is fantastic, tasty and filling. We were really lucky to be the only guests at the time as we got to talk to the whole family and we were also there when monks came to bless the property.

While planning the trip, all we really wanted was a decent room + bathroom to crash in after a long day of exploration; but Silver Cloud offered us so much more. Instead of merely dipping our toes, the warm and affectionate family who ran this hotel took our hands and we dove right into their lifestyle, experiencing the rich culture and values of the Ladakis! The majestic hotel with its traditional architectural beauty was equipped with all our modern day necessities such as centralized heating, 24-hour hot water supply and the paramount demand-  WiFi.

The beautiful property is set away from the hustle and bustle of main Bazaar of Leh still being not too far from the crowds.
