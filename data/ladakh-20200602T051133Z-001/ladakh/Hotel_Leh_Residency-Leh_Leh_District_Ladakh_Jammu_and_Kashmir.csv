ladakh,"Exceptional location near the airport and 15 minutes away from the local market. There was a narrow entrance but there was a good parking area for 3-4 cars. Rooms are spacious, comfortable and ensuite washrooms with sparkling floors and warm water from a geyser. Adequate service and excellent food.Free wifi and 24-hour electricity with a backup generator in the evenings. The chefs are communicative and listen to the suggestions. Chicken dishes are available in addition if required. Worth Revisiting Leh with excellent reception and other staff. Sleep is occasionally disturbed by a stray dog barking. There is no  heating arrangements but the bed with clean duvets are very comfortable",Prasanta D,/Profile/233prasantad,United Kingdom,40

ladakh,"very nice hotel, at the first look you will find the hotel to be not a good hotel but the staff make up for the looks by sevice megh who is the manager does everything possible to make life comfortable as well giving the correct advise to the travellers about Mountain sickness.food is good enough not great variety but you should expect that in place like leh where oxygen is at premium. all in all a good hotel for tour group would not recomend for individual travellers as away form market. Rs 200 for taxi.",anaxbio1,/Profile/anaxbio1,"Rajahmundry, India",40

ladakh,"Our family stayed at Leh Residency between 15 and 22 May. We reached the hotel quickly as it is very close to the airport.  There we received a warm welcome from Mr Megh Singh and team and were given room no. 101 & 102 for our stay. The rooms were spacious, with big windows and a very pleasant view outside (All the rooms in this hotel have these features).  Surroundings are very peaceful.  The hotel is new ( we could even smell paint), and the staff puts in their all to provide comfort to the guests. Some took time off to play passing the ball with my 5 year old son. We loved this gesture from them. They also helped out when we faced acclimatization issues.  They have a choice of veg and non-veg food. The chef knew his job and we thoroughly enjoyed the food there. Tasty. Not",Laiq Rizvi,/Profile/LaiqRizvi,"Mumbai, India",50
