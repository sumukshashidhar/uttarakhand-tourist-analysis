ladakh,"The review is for a stay in 3rd week of November.  As Pangong was too cold to make a nigh stay we decided on making a night stay at Tangste. The guest house was pre-booked by contacting the owner. They have 4 rooms. One 4 bed, two 3 bed and one 2 bed. 4 bed and one 3 bed room share a common toilet. Other two have attached toilets. There is one common local toilet. During our stay only common toilets were open. All attached toilets were locked down. Owner mentioned freezing temperature as the reason. The gas heater is available in all rooms only till 10:30PM. Sufficient quilts are provided. Food was good. The owner runs a hotel (The Pangong Residency) close by which is closed in winter.  Owner mentioned that he will be open during the winter but only local type of toilet will be",Rajanish T,/Profile/JajaborRaj,"Pune District, India",30
ladakh,"We reached Pangong late in the evening while driving from leh. It was getting dark and we were not able to reach the village ahead for stay. So, we decided to stop and took two wooden cottages facing pangong lake.  I would rate 5/5 for location.  Get the cottages in the first row itself directly facing the lake. Excellent views ..blue water in the morning , you can just walk down to the lake.  Cottage is huge with lots of space, a dining table, a large sofa and a separate bed room . You will get bucket of hot water in morning.  Toilets are clean but hot water is not available always.  Food is included in tariff . We found the tariff a bit high but location and service make it worth a stay. If you want to have a lake facing view of Pangong, homely cooked food, then this is the",Vipul V,/Profile/644vipulv,"Faridabad, India",50
ladakh,"The Changla Guest House at Tangtse [NOT Tangste as is wrongly spelt in the listing] was our accommodation last week for a trip to Ladakh's famous ""All Iz Well""  Pangong Lake.  Tangtse is about 30km from Pangong Tso.  We chose this because it was one of just two that were open at the time which had rooms with attached bathrooms and we did not fancy staying in a tent at the freezing cold lake shore with gusty worse than Arctic winds.  They also have rooms without attached bathrooms which are cheaper.  The guest house is run by the mother and daughter team of the Yakmik family.  Both were friendly and warm and did their very best to make our stay as comfortable as possible in the circumstances - freezing cold with no electricity or running water!  The room we were offered was large",G A,/Profile/Gita-TA,India,30
