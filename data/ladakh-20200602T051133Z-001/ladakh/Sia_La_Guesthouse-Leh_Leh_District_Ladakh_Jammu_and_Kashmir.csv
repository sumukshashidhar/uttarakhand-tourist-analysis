ladakh,"I spent 4 nights at this lovely guest house. The staff are super friendly and look after you really well and the home cooked lunches / dinners are delicious and some of the best food we had during our time in Ladakh - the paneer/pea curry with rice and popadom was amazing. They also provide plenty of free filtered or boiled drinking water. The rooms were simple but had comfortable beds, thick blankets and bathrooms with running hot water (solar). At night the put the room heating on for a few hours before bed and provide lovely hot water bottles, this keep us warm all night. Location wise, it was excellent, just a 5 minute walk from the main center of Leh - the walking street, shops, restaurants (most closed during winter months), temples and markets.

The rooms are clean and cosy. Kitchen staff served hot milk / black / ginger-lemon tea on request through out the day. We enjoyed the parathas, omlette, toast for breakfast and the veg/non-veg meals served during lunch/dinner.   One of our friends didn't acclimatize well and had to be taken to the hospital late at night. Arif was prompt and drove us back and forth to the hospital and to the clinic.

The staff noticed that I had been responding lesser and lesser throughout the day and constantly checked in to make sure I was doing okay. When it was apparent that I was not okay, they immediately drove me to the hospital and even spent the night while i was warded!  Who expects someone from a guest house to do something like that?

Options for B/L/D are fine, but the location is really convenient to the tourist district with wider food options. You can probably find cheaper (rattier) and more expensive (less traditional) options, but Sia La strikes the right balance. Probably the best part is the owner, Nabilay.

ladakh,"I'm a traveler from the US that spent 4 nights here before doing the Chadar Trek in early January. This seemed to be one of the few hotels in the area open in the winter. The room was really nice, with large windows that let in the sunrise. Very convenient to most anyplace in Leh. Breakfast with the proprietor was sitting cross legged on the Indian carpets while he cooked my breakfast. Really makes you feel immersed in the culture. Not like a sheltered guest in a big fancy hotel. The proprietor was VERY helpful with making arrangements when I needed them. It was just a cozy, comfortable place to stay. Would definitely stay here again.",Dave S,/Profile/660daves,"Oxford, Ohio",50

ladakh,Nabi and Zarina welcome you as a member of their own family.  They provide comfortable seats lined with Tibetan rugs to eat your breakfast.  Wholemeal pillows of delicious Tibetan bread arrive warm to be opened up and spread with delicious apricot jam or a tasty omelet. Endless milk tea ensures your adjustment to the altitude of Leh is comfortable and easy.   And thats just breakfast. Most rooms have a view and all rooms have a bathroom with constant 24 hour hot water.   Sia La is in a great position close to the shops and main street.  Its position over looking an abundant vegie garden looking to the snow capped mountains is quiet and relaxing - suited to the homely relaxing and welcoming atmosphere. Choose Sia La for your stay in Leh and you wont be sorry.   We have stayed,VPATraveller,/Profile/VPATraveller,"Inverloch, Australia",50
ladakh,"I have been staying in this beautiful guesthouse for last five years, both during summer and winter. One of the hidden secrets of Leh, right in the middle of the City and yet you feel the calm of a farmhouse. I think this is one of the few places that are open during winter. The owner and the family are quite amazing. Truly home away from home, you can have your breakfast or dinner right in the kitchen with a total family comfort as well as discussion.

On our journeys over the last 16 years with our daughter, Sia La is probably the best place we have stayed. Sure it is not five star, sure it doesnt have room service etc, but there is more to a stay than that. The owners Nabilay and Zerina and the way they run Sia La is the difference. They make you feel part of the family, and are some of the most generous hosts I have met. They go out of their way to make your stay in Ladakh a good one and are always concerned to help you. I have had friends stay there who have thanked me for recommending Sia La. One had to go to hospital with altitude problems and Nabilay &",peter b,/Profile/S2776AOpeterb,leongatha,50

The location is central, yet quiet. Adequate privacy is provided, but if you wish to mingle as a member of the family you are welcomed. The breakfast and dinner are tasty and a value. I continue to be impressed by the warmth, kindness, and generosity that the family places in their guesthouse.",Rebecca C,/Profile/256rebeccac,"Machynlleth, United Kingdom",50

My girlfriend and I stayed for 7 days in August 2013, and was extremely touched by the sincerity and hospitality of the family.   Nabilay, the manager, was extremely helpful with our requests and gave us great tips for our travel itinerary in Leh. An example is during the time when I had to submit a work assignment via email urgently but there was no internet in the entire town of Leh. When I informed Nabilay of my predicament, he immediately lent his USB stick modem. As such, I was able to submit my assignment on time, which would have been impossible if not for his generous gesture.

Its a nice, quiet and clean guesthouse with a beautiful garden where they plant their own veggies and just a 3 minutes walk from the market with all the restaurants. Especially memorable are the owners, they were really nice and warm people, fluent in english and also the staff, whose english wasnt that great always was super helpful.

Since they don't serve any meals other than breakfast, the location was just right to find several restsurents located on one of the main side streets. So food was never a problem.  There are two buildings. The owner family stays in one and also lets out some of the rooms in that building. The second building, just adjacent, is excludively for guests. We stayed in this second building, and I would say that this was the better option, given that it appeared to be provide greater privacy.
