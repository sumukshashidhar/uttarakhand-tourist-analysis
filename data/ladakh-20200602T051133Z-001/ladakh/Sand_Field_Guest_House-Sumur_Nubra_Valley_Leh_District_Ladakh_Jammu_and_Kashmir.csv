ladakh,"We stayed here on the tour that we booked via an agency in Leh. When we stayed here, we felt like this is home stay also. The host and their kids are very friendly. The room was spacious. The garden is super lovely. They has best apple tree so far in our trip. We had amazing experience during our stay here ^^",SummerKim2010,/Profile/SummerKim2010,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",50
