ladakh,"We were 2 families travelling to Leh in the month of August. It has been a bit late to write this review. But I would definitely mention my views for this hotel. It is an excellent hotel to be there with your family. It is a real home away from your home. The hotel owner Mr. Wangchuk & his daughter were very co-operative in all respects and also providing the minutest details relating to travel, markets, etc. The staff at the restaurant was exceptionally polite & hospitable. The breakfast & dinner was too delicious with a homely touch.  The rooms & toilets are spacious & very clean & well kept.  The hotel management organized for our pick up from the airport, travel & accommodation at Nubra valley & Pangong Lake & back and drop to the airport. I would highly recommend Ladakh",Preetam,/Profile/preetam70,"Pune, India",50

ladakh,"Ladakh Residency is a newish, large hotel for Leh, located on a main commercial street (but far enough away from downtown to be quiet). It seemed to us that most of the rooms had balconies with mountain views. Elevator. Our room was of modest size (we were able to add an extra bed to it) and was adequately clean. Breakfast was ok. Overall, a reasonable choice in Leh. ",twinssing,/Profile/twinssing,"Princeton, New Jersey",40

It's in Changspa, a place that one might find mention in inneumerable websites as a place to buy stuff from! So I would give the hotel two stars just for the location.  In all other requirements, the hotel is a soddy place. Rooms lack basic requirements as additional chairs to sit on. They try to make it up by providing toiletries by the dozen every now and then. The hotel does not have a view for the simple reason that it's wedged in between old structures... And though the hotel is big, it is not as big as it looks in the pictures on various websites.

The hotel had just opened again after the long winter break and hence  less staffing, new staffing, untrained staffing, low inventory, unchecked rooms  all problems were there. A luxury hotel should be ready ""before"" customers come in. Lets start from the begining. The pickup and drop to airport were not complementary: an expectation from good hotels, but thats ok.  The cab sent was nice, the driver was polite throughout the trip (though at times  he seemed to be in a hurry to get back to hotel). An early checkin request was  agreed upon. So that was good.

Mr. Wangchuk handled the logistics for our group and even booked us in the Hotel Omsila across the road when he could not accommodate our big group for all four nights.  He also can arrange for cultural performances. I much prefer quiet Changspa to the bustle of Leh.   We very much enjoyed our stay in Leh thanks to his hospitality.

The only reasons to not give a 5 star rating are that I was not impressed with bathroom ventilator windows opening into the corridors and I did not get hot water once for my shower.",SJ1960,/Profile/SJ1960,Chicago,40
ladakh,Ladakh residency is the apt place to stay in leh... It is very well located..right at the place where you want to be..leh market is 5min drive and the best of the food joints are round the corner. The structure itself gives you the feel of leh... The food was buffets which were well planned and it always felt you eating home cooked food which you really wish to have there because it's easier to digest that kind of food than heavy food because of the high altitude... Scenic beauty is not much but there.. A small lawn within premise adds to the beauty of the property... the staff was extremely helpful and available round the clock for any kind of assistance... We had taken up the taxi that was a xylo and the driver from the hotel people and it was a blessing as the car was in,pallavikhannaprakash,/Profile/pallavikhannaprakash,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"Ladakh residency is a family run hotel, the moment we checked in we felt very comfortable as the owner family and the staff are very hospitable,We spent five nights in this hotel out of eight nights in Ladakh ,Every time we came back after spending two nights in Nubra and again after spending one night at Pangong we felt as if we have reached home.The rooms are spacious and clean, food is good, view from the rooms and the terraces is wonderful overall a  hotel which I would like to stay again as and when I visit Leh",rajan51,/Profile/rajan51,delhi,50
ladakh,"My entire trip was planned out by Rinchen , including all arrangements for car, driver including packed lunches, no detail was left out. The rooms are comfortable, clean , safe with attached bathrooms. The restraunt staff was able to meet most of my demands for ""special"" items which were off the menu.  Leh, ladakh has the most amazing landscapes and natural beauty, you really have to be outdoors to enjoy it.  When I go again it will be ladakh Residency .",skjjDelhi,/Profile/skjjDelhi,delhi,50
ladakh,"The people are very nice. Beyond helpful. They made calls for us, arranged a room for our first night in another hotel (unfortunately, Ladakh residency was fully booked that night), gave us a lift to the other hotel... We had a problem with Kingfisher airlines during our stay and someone from the hotel accompanied us to the airport to help us & translate. The location is good. The balcony is great. The rooms are spacious & clean. There is hot water. However, no electricity at night (so take a torch) and some stains on the sheets. But overall a good experience. I do not think you'll find better in Leh.",Zinneke,/Profile/Zinneke,Brussels,50
ladakh,"hey friends.I visited ladakh june this year and when i came to know that hotels are full there I tried all hotels.Hotel Grand Dragon is a five star and when i came to know it is overbooked I thought of canceling the trip but then i came across this hotel website.Thought of give it a try and guess what it proved to be better choice.The hotel is run by uncle and her daughter who are managing the hotel very efficiently.Lift is there and believe me one have to use it while in leh due to high pressure one gets exhausted very soon.Breakfast was complimentary and we enjoyed it.They made arrangements for the cab,which was difficult to get in the tourist season though they charged little high from the market rate but the condition of cars and good driver make up for that.Rooms are",mangokhao,/Profile/mangokhao,Delhi,40
ladakh,"Ladakh Residency is a superb hotel, good location and Ms Rinchin along with her staff really takes good care of all her guests. A hospitable and very comfortable stay. The rooms are smart, neat and clean and spacious bathrooms. All rooms have a good view. The food is very tasty and they catered to our special requests as well. Rinchin also organised our entire trip in and around Ladakh, which was so well planned. We were there for a week and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. I would recommend each and every traveller to stay in this hotel and enjoy the hospitality of Rinchin and staff.",Ananya02,/Profile/Ananya02,Mumbai,50

ladakh,"The stay at Ladakh  residency was very comfortable . The attentive staff, Huge rooms(We stayed in a suite)  made the stay memorable. The food was like home cooked(Not too spicy or oily). Special mention goes to Mr. Wangchuk and his daughter Rinchen, who were with us in every step, arranging things, asking if we had a good time. It was like staying at a relative's place rather than a hotel.   Our driver Mr. Dorje, is one of the best drivers, who keeps is cool. No rash driving, and accomodates to every wish. Thanks, Mr. Dorje.  Last but not the least, The dining room staff  with Special mention to Vivek, (mr. Wangchuk, hold on to him. He is an asset to you). Who served us with a smile irrespective of the time of the day or their tiredness.",vme_2205,/Profile/vme_2205,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,I was there for 12 nights. Excellent  family looking after the hotel! Staff is co-operative. My kids were a little fussy about food but the staff was always there to provide the best  option. I am a frequent traveller. I would rate this hotel the best.,jollyDelhi,/Profile/jollyDelhi,delhi,50
ladakh,"Stayed in the hotel for two nights and the experience was great! They have the best exterior & interiors in Leh! Rooms are huge and clean. You have a lot of restaurants in walking distance. Since this is a new hotel, lift does not work yet, no telephones at room and the staff need more training! For one night, we came back to hotel at 10PM and the gate was locked. We had to knock for 10 mins to get ourselves in! Anyway, I am sure that it is temporary and the staff will get professional and systematic soon. The staff are very polite and helpful already.",Relaxed_Explorer,/Profile/Relaxed_Explorer,Guwahati,40
