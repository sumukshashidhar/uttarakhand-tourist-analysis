ladakh,"Was in Leh for a total of 15 days and out of that at least 5 days we stayed at The mogol hotel. We were there for a motorbike trip a  in and around Leh. It was my first time to that partof India and the places we went were just stunnning. Mountain tops lined with snow can be seen at the Mogol hotel in our rooms or at the roof deck. What a stunning view in high definition but without the TV. Who needs them. The town is just several minutes walk away from the hotel and the best part of it is we are at the end. When we head to the town from the hotel it is passing shops, cafes, street stalls before reaching the city centre. There ia a lot to see. Its actually a nice walk and has become our daily routine before or after breakfast and dinner. Trust me we all need a walk after",Macgoh,/Profile/Macgoh,"Pokhara, Nepal",50
ladakh,"Hotel Mogol in Leh has very decent rooms, a very helpful and cheerful staff. The owner gave us a brief about Leh and Ladakh and the precautions to be taken while venturing out. The food is basic but everyday they provided different varieties. Overall a very comfortable stay like a home.",Radhakrishna,/Profile/kkrish1967,"Bangalore District, India",40
ladakh,"This summers we decided to visit Ladakh and booked 7N/8 days trip to the pristine beauty i.e. Leh and surrounding areas.  We were booked at Mogol Hotel, which is located very close to the Water Springs and in the main tourist hub of Leh.  Overall a good experience, staff is ever smiling and always with quick response to all the requests made even at odd hours.  Food was delicious and good, although breakfast could do with some more choices.  Overall a good and comfortable stay will recommend it.",Sudhir Kalra,/Profile/SudhirK260,"New Delhi, India",40

Bath room and toilets are very neatly maintained. Wi-Fi facility available only in the reception area and outside the garden area. We stayed here for 5days in the month of August2018.

ladakh,"I stayed here for 3 nights before going on a trek to Stok Kangri. All my arrangements were made by KE Adventure, a UK company based in The Lake District.  The hotel is average and could be much better with a little effort. The Wi-Fi was poor, when it was working. The hot water was intermittent.

A special thanks to the manager, Mr Deepak Raj khadka, for being very polite and courteous. In fact all the staff members were very helpful. Even the owner Mr wangchuk is approachable and courteous towards the guests.  Overall a nice experience but they need to improve on providing hot water through out the day and wifi service as well.

ladakh,"We Stayed here for 5 nights (in the month of June) through Cox &Kings Tour package. Staff is courteous, we were given rooms earlier than the stipulated time due to our early flight. Hotel is very well maintained. Food (buffet) be it breakfast, lunch or dinner is good but after a given point in time, it becomes very monotonous (eating north Indian for lunch & dinner both). Last day of our stay we were surprised by Chinese cuisine, (thanks). Rooms are spacious, remember there are no fans in the hotel rooms (i guess none of the hotels in Ladakh have fans) but this could be an issue for someone like me who requires proper ventilation to sleep at night. (though the temperatures drop at night, the climate here is very erratic). Wifi in entire Ladakh is super bad, be it in hotels or",Amitsaga,/Profile/Amitsaga,,40
ladakh,Hotel is quite close to the Leh Market. Location is good from that perspective. Food is quite nice. They have a buffet as well as  Ala Carte.  The rooms are neatly maintained. The staff is very supportive. The internet connectivity is the biggest headache. Airtel as well as BSNL Signals are not strong and the hotel WiFi sucks. Availability of hot water is limited to a couple of hours in the morning and 1 hour in the evening. A good no frills budget hotel.,Prashanth Srinivasan,/Profile/PrashanthSrinivasan,"Bengaluru, India",30
ladakh,We stayed here as our booking for another hotel nearby was cancelled . For a last minute booking the rooms were good. The issue is primarily food. Breakfast was insipid and stone cold. The geyser in the so called super deluxe room worked intermittently . In other words avoid if you have a choice.   ,Harsh R,/Profile/harshr967,"Mumbai, India",20

ladakh,"The hotel is situated on one of the prime roads and close to shanti stupa (one of the iconic tourist attractions in Leh). The property has spacious rooms and makes one feel comfortable. The staff is coordial along with the manager, mr Deepak who is kind enough to help you with any possible queries. The food served is of a good quality and have a great presentation.  The owner of the property Mr. Ka is a friendly person and is easily approachable for any doubts, queries or suggestions one may have.  The property does have the parking space which can accommodate a few motorcycles and/or an SUV. Definitely a great place to stay if you have the budget and willing to have the comfort stay.",janaknmistry,/Profile/janaknmistry,"Mumbai, India",50

ladakh,"The Mogol Hotel is owned and run by an Indian Army veteran officer, Col TS Kalon, VSM Bar, (Retd) and his family. We stayed here from 11 to 21 Jun 2015. Our trip to Leh was a resounding success thanks to the tireless efforts of the management, especially Mr. Deepak, who anticipated our every need and surpassed our expectations. He planned our entire trip right from the moment we set foot in Leh to the day we left, ensuring that we got the maximum bang for our buck (Thank you so much, Deepak!). Col Kalon and his son, Namgyal are both extremely gracious and solicitous hosts, who made us feel at home and have ensured our return in the years to come.  The bed and breakfast plan is probably what most serious tourists will opt for, considering the fact that one'll be out all day",Parthasarathy Gopalan,/Profile/ScubaD0c,"New Delhi, India",50

They also offer one-day or longer trips in the region (we went to see the major monasteries in the nearby places, so we had our own driver that took us there and waited for us in each place).

Special thanks to the kitchen staff for the fabulous food! we liked everything about the hotel, maybe the bathrooms are a bit old fashioned but no problems with cleanliness or hygiene. The rooms at the back of the building (1st floor) where we stayed the first night was a bit cramped up and dingy (would suggest to avoid that) but we requested to be shifted in the front, which they did and had no problems.

The road is lively with many foreign tourists and youngsters roaming on the streets and sitting at various cafes & confectioners. The rooms ( attached bathrooms) are very neat. The hotel staff was warm and friendly however their attitude did change a little after we made them complete payment. Most of the guests at the time of check out were yelling at the staff / manager for various reasons..  Also I found the staff to be a little lazy as they had to be reminded many times to change bedsheets, make the room.. however if you are the non-fussy type traveler who requires a safe hotel with good location (at good price) MOGOL is a good choice.
