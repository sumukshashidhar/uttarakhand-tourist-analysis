ladakh,"We as a family have visited Leh a number of times and stayed in Kang Lha Chen always because of its hospitality, sumptuous food & central location. The owner Mr. Jigmet is a stickler for good housekeeping & tasty Chinese / Continental food.  ",Harivansh L,/Profile/HarivanshL1,"Jammu, India",50

ladakh,"The hotel has friendly staff and a good central location. The garden is very pleasant to sit out in and duvets and blankets mean you are cosy at night. The rooms are basic, bathrooms well cleaned but it is all a little shabby. Wifi very dodgy but that is true in all of Leh so be prepared! Hot water 6 - 9 in the morning and night only.",KJays,/Profile/KJays,"Chester, United Kingdom",30
ladakh,"One of Leh's oldest properties, this place is still among the best. Well maintained and spacious, it offers great views and fab service.

ladakh,"I stayed in the hotel from 26th to 29th May 2014. Being my first visit to Leh, that too with family, I was quite apprehensive about the harsh weather and a completely different terrain. But the hotel turned out to be a great experience. The hospitality of staff, right from the Manager Mr. Vijay to the waiters, was unmatched. My family had a great time staying over there.",KumarBrijesh,/Profile/KumarBrijesh,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"We checked in to this Hotel on 4th May, The manager Mr. Vijay, welcomed us with a warm smile on a Chilly Day and checked us in. He gave us the necessary instructions and tips to get acclimatized for the high altitude experience. Thanks to his advise, none of the members in our group had to face the High Altitude Sickness. The hotel is quite calm even though it is situated on the Main road opposite to the Leh Police Station. The rooms were neat and the linen was fresh. The food was very good, even though the roads to the main land ( Through Sri Nagar or Manali )  were  yet to open and fresh vegetables and fruits were yet to arrive, the manager tried his best to feed us well within the given circumstances. The staff were always smiling and helpful. The manager was very",Ravindranath R,/Profile/ravindranathr2014,"Hyderabad, India",40
ladakh,"We checked into hotel Kang Lha Chen last week after our shocking experience with Hotel Chube. The hotel is in an awesome area in the center of the city. As its built in a hugr area, there was no noise in rooms from the road. The rooms were neat and new. The service was good and the hotel manager was very professional. He advised us to stay one day in Pangong and not at his hotel to enjoy the beauty of Leh and gave us a detailed map of Leh:)  As we stayed for 2 days, we got a good bargain. The breakfast was good but one needs to go to the dining hall before 8.30 to enjoy the best of it. There is ample free space in the hotel to sit down and have a drink in the garden.",Navkant M,/Profile/Navkant,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,"I have visited hotel Kang Lha Chen during my trip to Ladakh in June 2012. The hotel is in quiet area, close to the centre of Leh. The hotel and the room was comfortable and clean, cold and hot water was available all the time. The food and service was excellent. The staff was cooperative, freindly and allways ready to help. I liked the Tibetian style of the hotel. The garden in front of the hotel is inviting to sit down at a table, order a drink and relax. At this point I would like to recommend the staff of the hotel to clean the chairs in the garden more fequently, since the chairs aren't used only by the guests, but also by the pigeons.",Peter K,/Profile/peterkY6454DE,"Baiersbronn, Germany",50
