ladakh,"This is a sweet guest house in a pretty quiet location. There is some building going on across the road, but it wasn't noisy when I was there. You can sit out in the garden. Some of the rooms have great views of the mountains. Guests can do some cooking in the family's kitchen, but there is no guest kitchen per se.",Peregrineri,/Profile/Peregrineri,"New Delhi, India",50
