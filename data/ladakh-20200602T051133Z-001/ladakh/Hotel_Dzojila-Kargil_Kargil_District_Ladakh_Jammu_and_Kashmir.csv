The new wing was beautiful and had very beautiful views from the verandah. We sat outside our rooms almost whole night and enjoyed the river running just below us. The service was very fast and their was a steward by the name of raju. He was very helpful and went out of the way to make our stay comfortable!!

Although the staff was really helpful and friendly. We were the last ones to arrive (it was a group tour) and it was really late, still they held the rooms for us despite the heavy tourist season. The food could have been better. And also they close the main door and expect the guests to retreat to rooms after 10:30, which I found a downcast.

The hotel employed people with no sense of hospitality. They don't even have any uniform so it is difficult to identify them in common area. However this hotel is very popular to traveller due to its good car parking facility and untrue publicity. I won't recommend it for a family trip.,gkpi,/Profile/gkpi,KOLKATA,10

ladakh,stayed here for a night enroute Leh from SXR. Considering the fact that Kargil has few options with not a lot of fancy amenities I must say that this hotel is really up to the mark. The room was nice and clean with the bathroom on a slope though owing to which water would enter the room when the bathroom was being used. However the staff is helpful and we had the water wiped off within minutes of informing the reception. Also the hotel has WI-FI. The hotel manager also allowed my friend to use the hotel laptop needed for some urgent work so they certainly were accommodating. Food was decent and the second floor open balcony is a great place to sit and chill. Overall satisfying stay.,SameenKhan,/Profile/SameenKhan4,"Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,You cannot expect anything more than this in such small  town. On our return journey from Leh this was our overnight stop. As small town we were least expecting anything other then a neat room and hygienic bathroom. And to our surprise this hotel had everything good. Hotel is not run by any professional team the owner himself is available. As there was route jam on the day we reached so hotel team was all involved in the knowhow of the groups coming to the hotel. Till late night at 3 am they were  receiving guests themselves. Staff of the hotel is very humble and courteous. Ready to help you.

The room was very average size but quite ok for that overnight stopover. The only problem i had was with the noise.

The rooms were warm, though there was no room heaters. The hotel amenities are quite basic, but truly speaking, it exceeded our expectations. What more can you expect in the late hours on and off Srinagar?

ladakh,"The thing is there are no alternatives. The sheets and towels are clean, and that's about it. The rooms are a bit run-down, although there is a new wing coming up. Also since it's right next to the road, there's traffic noise all through the night. But if you have to break at Kargil, this is a place to pick. Food is average - don't expect any luxuries as such. Running hot water is through a solar heater, so expect a bit of delay if you want a hot bath.",Roshun,/Profile/Roshun,"New Delhi, India",30
ladakh,We had to stop on the way from Leh to Srinigar and Kargil seemed like the best place.  But if I had to do it again I would stop anywhere else.  The town is dusty and noisy and the people in the street don't seem o welcome tourists.   This hotel has dirty linen and dirty furniture in the dining room.  The food was not hot enough for me to risk eating.  The wait staff were not pleasant.    The room was gloomy with low ceilings and many holes in the bathroom walls.  I did not want to risk opening my luggage in the room.  I did not want to sit on the bed.  Instead I chose to stay up all night in a plastic chair on the balcony.  That way my guides and driver could rest.  But we left a 4 AM.,Debbi2013,/Profile/Debbi2013,"Seattle, Washington",10
ladakh,"The room smells fine, sheets and towels look and smell clean. In places the faux wood wall paper is peeling. The carpets need to be vacuumed (or, better yet, replaced). The toilet seat and sink appear to have been cleaned. The light switches, faucets, handles are filthy, falling apart, or both. The Cable TV package is very lean. No wifi.  Dinner was very good. Served buffet, there were three main dishes I had never had before which were very tasty. Breakfast was mediocre -- don't even look at the butter!  The shower water was nicely hot with good pressure. The bed is a four inch thick hard mattress on a board. I slept well.  The hotel is located in a mixed light industrial area well outside the main market. My room was in the back and so was quiet. At seven there was a knock on",Paul K,/Profile/go2places,California,20
ladakh,"Though this hotel is a budget hotel, we were charmed by the hospitality extended to us by the hotel staff. Their Manager Panditji is an extremely amiable person. He made sure we got good rooms (all rooms are decent and clean with hot bath as kargil can get quite cold in the evenings) and a good spread of hot, decent buffet. We enjoyed the food thoroughly and we also got an early morning breakfast as we wanted to leave early morning for Leh. overall, I had a good experience staying at this hotel and would recommend to all.",meera72,/Profile/meera72,"Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,Hotel has some new and some old rooms. Very noisy room as it is on a busy road which has regular traffic. This hotel is the best amongst the options available in Kargil.  Food is good and staff is helpful.  Tariff is high for what it is.,ANSKAUSHIK,/Profile/ANSKAUSHIK,New Delhi,30
ladakh,Kargil does not have too much on offer in terms of quality accomodation ......... of the options available D'zojila is the best. It has clean rooms and loos and you can look forward to a decent nights sleep at the hotel. The hotel has some recently built rooms on the higher floors which are a better bet.... try to get one of those.,sidpakrasi,/Profile/sidpakrasi,"Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,"I had booked this hotel almost month before our planned trip by calling up hotel directly. Good thing is that manager did not ask for advance money to be deposited/paid when booking was made. He (Mr. Ankur Sharma) was also helpful when we postponed our booking by a day.   good things: booking made without advance buffet breakfast was good  Sad part of hotel: Block where we got the rooms were really old and not well maintained. There were new blocks to. So, if you are booking ask for rooms in new block. This hotel is comparatively expensive compared to amenties / condition it is in. No hot water was running and bathroom condition is poor (see picture).   Suggestion: The other green hotel I think has new block which we checked and it seems to be good. that had even good rooms with",travelsuggestions,/Profile/travelsuggestions,"Sydney, Australia",30
ladakh,"This hotel has different rooms.. some newly built, some old.. we reached kargil really late because we stopped for a long time at war memorial. When we reached the hotel, the rooms were a little bit different from what we expected. Mainly the carpets were a little but dirty and old.  Hotel staff were good. But early morning we had problems in getting hot water which delayed out travel to leh by atleast an hour. Overall not so good experience but  then there are not many options in kargil in first place.. so best among the ones available i guess",kedar83,/Profile/kedar83,"Bengaluru, India",20
ladakh,"Ask for a room on the 2nd floor, they're new and the bathrooms are much better. The room is clean, decent and OK for a night's stay. Cable TV is available which was nice as we got there on the day of the French Open Men's final! Doesn't have running hot water which was a bit of a letdown but I think that's the best one can hope for in the town.... Dinner was simple, veg fare and breakfast was eggs and toast with milk and cornflakes, perfect for an early start. Overall, a decent enough hotel for a night's stay...do not expect much and you will be OK!",KingKongGurgaon,/Profile/KingKongGurgaon,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
