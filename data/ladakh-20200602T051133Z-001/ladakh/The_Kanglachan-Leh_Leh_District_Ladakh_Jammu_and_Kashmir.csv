ladakh,"We stayed in this Hotel for 5 nights in two stretches....2 nights & 3 nights. The experience was great. We were 3 adults and were to be provided an additional bed in the room. It was in place before we reached. We had been traveling for 2 days prior to that from Srinagar to Leh and needed the rest urgently, which the hotel seemed to be fully aware of. They even told us that they will not disturb the room in the intervening night when we will be out (to Pangong Lake) and we may even keep our luggage back. We had booked through Make My Trip and would like to thank them for the choice. The food is superb. They have a lot of European guests and as a result are forced to offer a sort of continental buffet. But a couple of spicy Indian items are also available. They also offered us to",Subhasish M,/Profile/15subhasishm,"Kolkata, India",50

ladakh,"We checked in this hotel in 16-May-2014. Our travel agent was Cox and Kings. The Hotel is right next to the main market area of Leh, so it is just a short walk for local shopping. We were warmly greeted by the manager Mr. Vijay and briefed about altitude sickness and what to do and not to do for taming it. He and his staff made our stay like in home away from home. Hot water, at odd hours too, were arranged immediately without any fuss. One day we had to get ready at 5AM. Hot water for bathing and breakfast was ready on time. Though the roads and supplies were not fully opened at that time of the year, Mr. Vijay tried his best to provide variety in Lunch and dinner. Food was light (to keep your digestive system under control) but delicious, especially soups. One day he even",Kishalay H,/Profile/Kish4Travel,"Bengaluru, India",50

ladakh,"Juley (hi)  We were booked at this hotel by our travel partners Cox and Kings. We had our apprehensions basis previous feedback on trip advisor. My take on this property is as follows:-  1. Location - Good ,near main market 2. Property condition - Good , new construction.  3. Cleanliness - Ok, watch out for the toilets. they don't have exhaust and the stink remains. 4. Food - Food quality is ok. However, they don't have buffet breakfast and Alacarte.  5. Service - Standard. The real dampener is that there is no room service. imagine if you have to go to the restaurant at 6 am for your bed tea.",Indronil,/Profile/Indronil,"New Delhi, India",30

Can you help being located on a crossing anywhere in India where everyone has to honk while driving past.
