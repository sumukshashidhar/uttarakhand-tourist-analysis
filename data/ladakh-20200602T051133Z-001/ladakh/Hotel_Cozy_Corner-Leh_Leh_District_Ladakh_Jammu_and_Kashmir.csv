ladakh,"I stayed at the hotel for two nights last month and had a very positive experience.  The hotel is conveniently located a few blocks away from the Leh market and right across from a nice grocery store (adequately catering to my late evening chocolate/pepsi cravings).  The hotel provided me with clean sheets, clean bathrooms and most importantly running hot water and an in room heater.  In winter not many restaurants are open in Leh - The Cozy Corner restaurant stayed open and I enjoyed their dosas very much... not just me, 6 others joined me for dinner and had the same opinion.  The owners were absolutely fantastic and flexible in catering to both my room and my restaurant needs.  I will certainly be back at the Cozy Corner when I visit Leh next.",RRT2018,/Profile/RRT2018,,50
ladakh,"The restaurant is located in midst of the market. The rooms are utilitarian and offer basic facilities. Since the set backs of building are minimal, room ventilation may be issue at times. Otherwise, owners are helpful and prompt in their management. Their lobbies are too small and at times difficult to rest with noisy travel groups in adjacent rooms.  Don't depend on their restaurant, I would rather recommend walking down to nearby restaurants in the market.",Chandan C,/Profile/_urbanmatters,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30

ladakh,It was a wonderful experience while staying in hotel.. Very near by main market and staff is excellent with such nice attitude. I will surely recommend this as it has very homely feel and food served here was fab. One of the best in leh!!,Arjun S,/Profile/ArjunS1181,,50
ladakh,"As hikers we all were very accomadating to the poor service and the basics being difficult to provide in Leh in winters , however even with that background each one of us thought the place was terrible.   No facility of even a bucket of water provided for basic hygiene .(flowing water is a luxury in the winters but we have realised that all other hotels offer that just at a marginal cost )  Rooms are very poorly lit  Management has a callous additude to poor service  No basic hygiene maintained.",maitlis,/Profile/maitlis,"Pune, India",10
