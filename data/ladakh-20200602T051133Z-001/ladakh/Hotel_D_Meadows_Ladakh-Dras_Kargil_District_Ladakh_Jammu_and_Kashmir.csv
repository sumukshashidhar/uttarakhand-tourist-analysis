ladakh,This is the best resort one can find in Dras. Stayed there during July 2019. Centrally located. Close to Kargil War Memorial. Exceedingly helpful owner and staff.  Superb food and hospitality. Highly recommended. Prashant Verma,Prashant V,/Profile/prashantkverma,"Pune, India",50
ladakh,"Quite a nice hotel in Dras market, with all basic amenities you look for in a hotel. The rooms were comfortable, the staff friendly & helpful. Considering the location of the hotel (Dras, which remains cut off for 4-5 months in a year due to closure of the Zoji La pass), this hotel is well managed. The food was also good. One is willing to overlook minor housekeeping issues as the staff makes an earnest endeavour to attend to any compliant. Overall, the best hotel in the region without doubt.",psk1972,/Profile/psk1972,"Secunderabad, India",50
ladakh,"Visited the hotel during a merrrage function and the hotel was our home for 10 days, Is the only luxury hotel in drass with beautiful interior. Rooms are well equipped with modern amenities and luxury bathroom products. The view from the window is mesmerising and the sunset is the must see from the room.  The multi  cuisine restaurant is the best in drass and the only multichannel restaurant in whole dras. Kargil war memorialis at some distance but is a must see place around. A short trip to Munmun top is the must have trip in drass. The staff of hotel are very professional very helping, hope hotel will maintain the it's reputation.",shahida,/Profile/Shahida1234,,50
