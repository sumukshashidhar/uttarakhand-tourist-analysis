ladakh,Alpenglow Pangong Camps is the the last resort along the  located at a vantage position and has a nice view of the lake. One can watch a beautiful sunrise in front in the backdrop of the lake. One can easily drive up to the site and park the vehicles. Tents are comfortable and save you from the chilly breeze. Staff was cooperative and met the needs.,mohtaanup,/Profile/mohtaanup,Delhi,40

ladakh,Good hospitality. Neat and clean tents. Quality bedding. Food and service is also good. Do not carry very high expectations. Considering the hostile climate and limited resources they are doing a very good job of running the show,Guest Relations,/Profile/GuestRelation_MGR1,Mumbai,50
ladakh,Tents and location is perfect for stay near beautiful pangong lake. But just make sure about availability before hand. Ask for confirmation of the tents to your travel agent/owner of this tent beforehand. Thats the only headache about them.,TopReview_1,/Profile/TopReview_1,"Pune, India",40
ladakh,"The location was very good, the service was excellent.

ladakh,Tiny resort and new one. The tents are very good. The wash room is excellent. Hot water is available through Solar water heater. Power is available from 1830-2230 Hrs only through DG set. If The Morning is cloudy then hot water from Kitchen will be arranged. The food is homely and not much variety. Enjoyed the food.,Venkateswar,/Profile/Venkateswar,"Navi Mumbai, India",50
