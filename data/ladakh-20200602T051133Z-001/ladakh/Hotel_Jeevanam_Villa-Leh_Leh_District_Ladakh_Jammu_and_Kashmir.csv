During our second visit to this hotel, we were given rooms in the ground floor (starting with 1 series) which seemed little congested, old. Irrespective of new or old, the hotel is very well maintained and deserves five star for the same. The staff and owner of the hotel are very friendly and are very good hosts. Food is of very good quality and is of local taste but buffet should have had little more options. The stay is away from the city, very close to the leh airport and finding autos could be tough.

ladakh,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. Loved the experience! This is a small hotel with around 15 rooms. The owners live alongside the hotel in the same compound and provide homely care. The view from the hotel - overlooking the mountains - is excellent . The corridor at the entrance to the hotel is colourful with many flowers grown! The food was great. One of the staff members, Mr. Rahul, was in particular very helpful. Not giving a 5 star as there was frequent power cut and the generator wasn't being switched on. All-in-all, a lovely experience!

Hence after careful evaluation, we had chosen Ladakh as our dream destination. We had a wonderful stay at Hotel Jeevanam for 4 nights and it was really a memorable experience.  This is relatively newly constructed property with a sophisticated touch of Ladahkhi architecture and very well managed by the Hotel Owner (Husband and Wife) and Manager (Rahul) who are polite and easily approachable.

ladakh,"Few reasons why you should choose this hotel for your stay in Leh;  1. It‚Äôs just 10 minutes away from the airport, which makes going to and fro the airport easy.  2. It‚Äôs probably the only hotel with a 24*7 hot water service.  3. The food is very nice and hygienic. A lot of different varieties of foodstuffs are also provided.  4. The owner, Yangchan, has a very homely attitude which makes you want to stay longer at the hotel. The staff associated with the hotel are also helpful in providing knowledge and help about local places to visit, things to buy, etc.  If you‚Äôre ever going to stay in Leh for a few days, this place should be on top of your list.",Shashank R,/Profile/ShashankR177,,50

He is very famous in ladakh and has really good bikes - APEX ADVENTURE. We rented 3 new Himalayan bikes from him. His brother's family stays in same property in different building and also maintains it. Food is delicious and home cooked. They even allowed us to help them in their kitchen.
