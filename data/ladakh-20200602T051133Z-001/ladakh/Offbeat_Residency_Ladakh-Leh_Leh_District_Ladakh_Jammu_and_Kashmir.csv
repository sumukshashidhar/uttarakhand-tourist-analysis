ladakh,"This was the place I checked in on the day I arrived. The staff was very welcoming. They are just run by normal local people, not qualified hotel staff but their hospitality was very forthcoming. Always responded to our requests on time. Food was good at times but overall I thought it could have been better. This place is a 20 minute walk from the main market. Have your cell phones charged up if you go after evening hours as the street where this is located has no street lights whatsoever. You can see the Shanti Stupa up top from a few rooms here. The rooms are very spacious and big, washrooms neat and well maintained. The pillows and bedsheets were very clean. The name describes the place as how it is, Offbeat. Very quiet and peaceful.

ladakh,"Juley..!! When u visit any place you would like to experience the soul of that place...   That's precisely what happened at Offbeat..!! The staff was very jovial,  always smiling and helping us with our silliest request... On one such occasion we requested to ourselves cook in their kitchen to make Biryani as we were in the mood for it and they allowed with a smile...  They have the best hospitality... Our driver and guide-Nurboo added all the charm to drives by laughing at our jokes and tolerating our nakhras on the ride...  He even followed our raft during the river rafting to click our candid pictures on our request....We wanted to experience the tradition in Leh and he invited us for his family function- of course we didn't go but that was really touching...

ladakh,"My husband and me visited Leh for a week and for approx 5 nights we were staying at Offbeat. The place is located within 10 mins of driving distance from the airport and has a lovely view of the mountains. We were staying in 106 which had both the mountain view as well as the garden view. The staff is the best I have come across. Dichung, Vijaybhai and Chetan were available 24*7 and the food was like home cooked food :) We were floored by the hospitality and courteous nature of the staff. Stanzin also planned the rest of the tour for us and it was perfect. We did not have any problems. Will definitely recommend this place and Stanzin for your tours and travels :) ",schoudhary87,/Profile/schoudhary87,"Kolkata, India",50

ladakh,"Juley OFFBEAT RECIDENCY. I will be precise in this review-  Location - Perfect.A short 15min walk to the main Leh market, through an idealic back lane which proves perfect to get your body acclimatized to high altitude. Close enough to market for daily shopping trips,far enough from market to be close to nature with great views from rooms.  Staff - The entire staff led by Stanzin (tanni) is super jovial and friendly...with always a smile on their faces and always eager to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Special thanks to Tanni chhun, Gawa, Aijaz.  Transport - perfect arrangements were done by the hotel staff, car was provided in perfect condition. Special thanks to Musa acho for being the most polite, helpful, understanding and an excellent and competent chaufer. I",Divya01,/Profile/Divya01,"Mumbai, India",50
