ladakh,"I stayed here but because of the early snowfalls, we stranded in hotel for 2 days. The weather was so cold. Everything was good include the room with water heater, but they dont provide fireplace in the dining / lobby area which is we need it so much. I started had my flu and fever within the stranded period and couldnt stand the coldness. Maybe the owner can improve on that issue. Overall was good ðŸ˜Š. ",Puteri Pasola,/Profile/yaya6787,,40
ladakh,"I stayed three nights and couldn't have had a better stay.  Not only do most rooms have balconies with views of the mountains (as mine did), and the rooms are spacious and well-kept, but the family who owns the hotel lives on the first floor.  That meant that I was able to have dinner prepared by them for a small cost (around 5 dollars as I recall), so I got to eat authentic Ladakh food (otherwise hard to find, the restaurants mostly serve Western or non-Ladakhi Indian food).  In fact, I was even able to make specific breakfast requests, such as for the typical Ladakhi buckwheat soup/porridge.  And the owner (Tundup) kindly helped me arrange with a taxi to make local excursions to see the area, temples, etc, and gave me great advice on exploring Leh itself.  So overall it is",Tyche75,/Profile/Tyche75,"San Francisco, California",50

ladakh,A beautiful Guest House near Shanti Stupa and warmly maintained by the owner Mr. Tundup & his caring wife. You will sure to have Ladaki Feeling as you will stay in their cosy rooms. Especially the Dining area and Couches in Lawn are worth appreciation. We a group of 10 had a great time partying there till wee hours. They asked for our choices in Dinner & Breakfast and the preparations were tasty. Value for money & perfect.,Rishu J,/Profile/318rishuj,,50
ladakh,"Mr. Tundup (an ice hockey player) and his wife are the perfect hosts and have one of the best guest house.  We were surprised by the rooms which were almost 5 star quality.  The cleanliness, the awesome food, the helpful nature of the host in ensuring we are comfortable and plan our trip accordingly was great.  A beautiful place with a lovely garden and view to the Shanti Stupa..truly relaxing.  We were a group of 3 girls on our 1st trip to Leh and must say it was a great experience.
