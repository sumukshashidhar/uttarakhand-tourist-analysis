ladakh,Let me start with the positives.. Rooms are spacious with wooden ceiling and furnitures. Some of the staffs are humble and cooperative. Housekeeping is good. The main negative point is supply of limited hot water. They don't have facility to give it all the time. Food they serve is not upto the mark. Very poor wifi connectivity. ,Baburajnair,/Profile/Baburajnair,"Coimbatore, India",30
ladakh,"Hotel rooms are cozy with wooden ceiling. Food served is very good. Hotel staffs are quite humble and gentle. Hot water availabe only in day time as hotel has only solar water heater. Wifi avbl but range is quite poor. Rooms are spacious and clean. Every room has large windows to enjoy the outer beauty. Sufficient blankets provided by hotel no need to carry your extra. Day time are normal in leh but at night you will experience the real cold, which is manageable inside the room with blanket. Location is very close to main market, walking distance. Tourist attraction ""Leh palace"" is in front of the hotel.     I will advice you as per my experience after reaching Leh, firstly check your oxygen level at hotel, airport or at  hospital. If your level is below 80 then arrange a oxygen",Srikant Sagar Padhi,/Profile/SrikantSagar,"Cuttack, India",40
ladakh,"A small hotel, quite spacious clean rooms. Good room service. Having food in their restaurant is a fun. Homely food. The hotel is a little away from the main city market. Its about 10-15 minutes walking distance, but you have option to book a cab at hotel counter by paying around 500 Rs. for to and fro travel. Outside view is marvellous. You can see a range of small stupas at the foothills if you open the windows of your room. The hotel doesn't have a lift, so climb up on stairs very slowly to keep your self safe .",dnaoncology,/Profile/dnaoncology,"Mumbai, India",30

ladakh,One of the good place to stay near to the market. Good rooms and nice hospitality. Value for money. Rooms are spacious and service is also at par considering the value which is been paid.

ladakh,"Hotel Royal Plaza, can be called a cozy hotel, situated at just below the Leh palace and a minute walk away from the Market. The rooms were good enough, but the USP of the Hotel is the Staff. Namgyal, The manager of the hotel was a superb host. We dint feel like we were staying away from home. he was very supportive and friendly. the only issue at the hotel was of the wi-fi, as due to some work was going on with BSNL line the access to internet was not possible for a day. overall the hotel was was good. I would recommend this hotel for its cordial staff and service.",Vibha T,/Profile/vibhat2016,"Gurgaon District, India",40

ladakh,My mother and I stayed here in August for several nights and would thoroughly recommend it. It is in a fantastic location if you wish to be close the market yet still have some peace and quiet. Our room had a great view of the Palace and mountains. The staff are wonderful and it is great value for money.,EmmaHIreland,/Profile/EmmaHIreland,"Brussels, Belgium",50
