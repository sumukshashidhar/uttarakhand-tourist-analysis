ladakh,"Smanla was the best homestay we had in Ladakh. Room and bathroom were clean. I have to mention the great matress and the cozy blankets - our best sleeps within 2 weeks in Ladakh. The view on stock kangri out of the rooms on the first floor and from the terrace is amazing. Staff and host were very friendly and helpful. It's a 15 min walk to main market, small grocery market is just 3 min away. If we come back to Leh we will definitely go to smanla guesthouse!!!  PS: we asked for bowls and spoons to make our own (gf) musli for breakfast on the terrace (see picture)",arvidk1312,/Profile/arvidk1312,,50
ladakh,"This family-run place was recommended to us by some German travelers and we could not have been happier with our stay there. The guest house consists of simple, cozy rooms with attached bathroom; prices range between INR1000-1500 depending on size and view. The view from the terrace is spectacular. There is a restaurant but I cannot comment on the food, as we never ate there, as we preferred to eat out and taste the cuisine of the various restaurants and eateries across the city. In some cases, breakfast is included. The guesthouse is located a twelve-minute walk from the center of town. The delightful, hardworking owner (a doctor in Tibetan medicine) and his son run the operation and both speak excellent English. All staff are incredibly kind and obliging.

ladakh,"Located at a very beautiful location loved the view outside my room. Rooms are clean, cozy and comfortable. Since we were a huge group they gave us generous discount also. The owner is very friendly and very caring, he helped us with all the necessary information wherever required the son was also quite helpful.   The food served at their restaurant was so homely very well prepared. We got the perfect spot to relax and good food after our long journey from delhi to leh.   Only the service is little slow but until it was served with smiling faces we didn't mind.   If you are looking for calm and little out of the main market but also walkable distance stay this is the place. They also grow their own herbs and vegetables in the season.",Sneha T,/Profile/SnehaT120,"Hyderabad, India",40
ladakh,"We stayed for eight days at the end of August 2016. The rooms are very clean, light and spacious with excellent views. Beds are comfortable, sheets and towels are clean, there's plenty of solar heated hot water. There's a marvellous terrace to sit out and soak up the views of the mountains and acclimatise to the altitude.  Tsewang and his family were wonderful hosts - very welcoming and thoughtful, full of suggestions for walks and trips - and caring when we were getting used to the altitude and when we came down with food-poisoning (from the Wok restaurant in Leh). They made tea and cooked meals for us when we didn't have the energy to go out, and once we were recovered, organised taxis, permits and homestays for trips to Lamayuru and Pangong Lake - which were amazing.

ladakh,"Stayed here for 2 nights, 30th June & 1st July in one of the standard rooms on the 1st floor. Couldn't get the deluxe rooms.  Room as well as the linen was clean & we had good rest here before starting our Nubra trip.  It's a small but neatly maintained place & Dr. Tsewang, the owner, makes a good effort to keep you comfortable.  Room we stayed did not have TV & I believe that's true for all the rooms. The Wifi too was extremely patchy which pretty much all the places in Leh have in common.  Also, there isn't any parking space, even for bikes. It's a cozy small place frequented by foreigners staying for longer durations & not really looking for any amenities.  ",anandqk,/Profile/anandqk,"Bengaluru, India",30
ladakh,"I stayed here with a large group.  We stayed about 7 days during 2 different time periods.  It was a bit of a walk up a gentle hill on the edge of town.  During the day the walk in and out of town was fine.  In the dark it was a bit precarious-a light is helpful to carry.  I loved the quiet and the views.  Has a roof top deck that overlooks beautiful peaks.  The rooms are on the smallish size for 2 with luggage, clean and warm water most of the time.  The flower plantings are random and charming.  We held several yoga classes in a large room with a big window facing the mountains.  They do have some yoga mats.  The breakfast was decent and they always made sure we had hot water and tea thermoses. Internet was iffy but I have a feeling that was the same everywhere.

ladakh,"Amchi (tibetan doctor) Tsewang Smanla is most welcoming host and treats his guests as part of the family. He will provide any sort of support and will make your stay in Leh nice and easy. The Guest House is 15 minutes walking distance from the noisy town centre, even less is you take a shortcut that leads through the street where all the bakeries are, do not miss the chance of fresh bread every day! My room on the first floor had a nice view towards the glacier and Leh Palace. Breakfast is simple but healthy and any request is warmly welcomed. Dinner is also available on request. Taxi/jeep/travelling permits. Tsewang is an attentive doctor that looked after us in a mindful way aware of problems altitude and long distances travel may cause. I warmly recommend this place.",FedericaRaggio,/Profile/FedericaRaggio,"Milan, Italy",50
ladakh,"I visited Leh in June 2014 with my husband. We stayed at the Smanla Guest House for three days. The experience of staying at this guest house was simply wonderful. The owner of this guest house, Mr Tshewang was a very caring and jovial man. Being in a new place, in a new environment can be stressful, but Mr Tshewang with his smiling face and with a homely calm looked after our every need, whenever called for.  The location of this guest house is it's biggest asset. It is just 10 mins. from Leh's main market. The Leh palace and the Shanti Stupa can be seen from the guest house itself. Rooms are clean and the hotel staffs are friendly. Mr Tshewang himself arranged taxis for us for sightseeing. All in all Smanla guest house is a home away from home !

ladakh,"I had travelled to Leh in mid September 2013 for about 12 days and I stayed at Smanla for about 8 days. It is only a few minutes walking distance from the main market place. I have nothing but praises for the owner who showed great hospitality and welcomed me as a single traveler and made me feel at home. The rooms and washroom are quite spacious and the terrace can offer some superb mountain views while sipping some hot coffee/tea or reading a book!  Mr. Tsewang is a very helpful and generous man. He helped me organize a guide for me to Markha Valley. I was facing difficulty in receiving money transfer from Delhi and he instantly offered me cash. By the way, he makes excellent omelette!!!

Deluxe rooms are the best with white linen, soft quilts, woollen rugs, tibetan furniture. Moreover it is on the central way for moving towards Nubra valley, stupa view from the back side, monastery right there on the top. Hot tea served in the morning with lovely breakfast, fresh apricots on the breakfast table. Terrace sitting is also luxurious. Comfortable, open, friendly.

The location is little bit away from the market... may be a kilometer or two away. This is why the location is quiet and peaceful. The rooms are neat and clean. They are quiet spacious as well with minimum required furniture. Bathrooms are clean, big and have running hot water.   There are a few limitations like, no television sets and other things like a restaurant. They make made to order meals and breakfast. Staff is limited.

Owner is a doctor in tibetean medicine and a very social person; right from picking us from the airport, arranging tours, food, etc he has taken care very nicely, & even still in contact. Rooms were new, comfortable. No room heater. Luckily we had one hair drier which was helpful to some extent.  There was hot water in morning in tap (if lines were not frozen) and buckets when ever we needed. Temp. was below zero all days. Since roads to Leh were not open, all food he served was made from vegis from his farm. We had a wonderful winter experience during our visit. Missed kardug la due to heavy snowfall.

ladakh,My husband and me were guests at Smanla´s Guesthouse last summer 2012 and we all were very very happy to be there! The guesthouse is situated about 10 to 15 Minutes footwalk from the city centre of Leh and has an awesome view ( Mountains and Monastry) when sitting on the terasse. Everyone working there was helpful at all times and we felt like a big family. Tsewang picked us up from the airport and helped us with experienced advice all the time through our stay (one month). The neighbour kids were welcome to come and play with my 5 year old daughter and we all could take could rests (in the beautiful flower garden) from our excursions we made.

He was very helpful in letting me call the travel agent in Delhi to get in contact with the local tour guide as I didn't have any contact details for them.  The rooms are simple but clean and comfortable. The hot water is only available in the morning. I had only booked breakfast here and that was always very good.  The guest house is situated in a quiet part of Leh surrounded by small fields.  It really is a nice spot of relax and get away from it all.  The views out over Leh Palace and the Stok Ranges from the upstairs patio are beautiful. It is not in the centre of Leh so it is away from the traffic noise.

ladakh,"Stayed there for a few days in summer 2011. I've found this guesthouse in internet and their website was so nice, friendly and promising good facilities for a reasonable price, that we booked it via e-mail and requested an airport pick-up. Everything was confirmed by the owner. When we arrived at the airport, nobody was waiting for us. Ok, we took a taxi and went to Smanla. The owner looked quite confused meeting us - he forgot about pick-up and our booking. We had to wait for rooms while they had to be cleaned, but when we moved in, all the furniture and floor was very dusty - as it hasn't been cleaned at least for a month! Moreover, it was an early morning but no hot water, although the website declared that they have hot water all the time!

ladakh,"My husband and I selected this guest house after reading the excellent reviews on TripAdvisor...and it was the first time that our experience was significantly different from what we had read.  We would definitely not recommend this guest house to others...in particular if they are travelling in the ""low"" season (we were there in early May).  There are much nicer/newer places in Leh for close to half the price of the more expensive rooms here.  First, the positives:  Location: For us, the location was ideal.  It is slightly outside of the town center (about a 10 minute walk, mostly uphill, from most of the shops/restaurants).  Obviously others have seen the potential of this area as there were 3-4 guest houses under construction along the way!

ladakh,"Leh has become a hot spot for tourists off late and a lot of domestic crowd as well as foriegn nationals travel during the months May - August. Keep this in mind and make your travel arrangements in advance as all the good hotels and guesthouses are gone if you are one of the late bookers.   I was a little skeptical since I have a mind block against 'guest house' as oppose to a hotel but was pleasantly surprised with the hospitality and just the sheer beauty surrounding the guest house.  Smanla is located very close to the Airport (15 minutes drive) and is run by a very cool Mr. Seywang who is a local Tibetan medicine practitioner.

ladakh,I arrived in Leh planning to trek - I had booked in to Smanla because of the good reports I had read and because my emails had been replied to quickly and the price was reasonable. When I arrived Tsewang was waiting at the airport (even though the plane was a couple of hours late). I had lots of questions about possible routes and treks and how to arrange what I wanted to do. Tsewang went out of his way from the very beginning to give me good advice and to help me get organised. He was always ready to phone his own contacts to check prices and also whether particular routes were passable etc. He provided options and his advice was always pragmatic and reasonable. He was also concerned about my taking enough time to acclimatise and being healthy. We spent many evenings chatting,696ChasM,/Profile/696ChasM,"Wellington, New Zealand",50

ladakh,"We spent five nights with Tsewang,the owner of this guest house. He arranged a fabulous two day excursion to Yamaluru and where his brother-in-law was our guide for tours to the monasteries. Tsewang's personal attention and kindness helped to make our stay there a fabulous one. No matter what time we woke up (and it was often very, very early due to jet lag), he had tea waiting for us on the rooftop patio. We spent many hours just chatting with him about his family history and it was a very emotional experience when it was time to say goodbye.
