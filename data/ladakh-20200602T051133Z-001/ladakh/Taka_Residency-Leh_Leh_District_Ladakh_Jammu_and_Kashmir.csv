ladakh,"We stayed at this place during our last week trip to Leh Ladakh. They also arranged our entire trip to various places in Ladakh. It is a budget home stay option. Do not go with big expectations and you will not be disappointed.  Some renovation work was going on in the hotel due to which a lot of noise during the day time and the entire place was full of sand and dirt.   Hospitality at its best, people are very nice and cooperative. The place is average, closer to Airport 10 mins drive and 10 mins walk from Leh main market. You get to eat the food of your choice.",indian302,/Profile/indian302,"Hyderabad, India",30
