ladakh,"We were a group of 5,we stayed here before and after our Chadar Trekking.Nice place to stay.Since it was January it was biting cold the staff were extremely helpful in proving us all that we needed in terms of Hot food,Tea,Blanket with heaters & Room heaters. we had difficulty in getting hot water,it is understandable knowing the harsh weather that was during our stay.only feedback to the management is to improve the wash room. A special mention need to be made about the hygienic and tasty  food that was served that too with a lot of love and affection.",karthik g,/Profile/vahnitoolings,"Mysuru (Mysore), India",40
ladakh,"we usually stay in 4 star hotels while holidaying and i was very dissappointed when i saw this hotel room.  it is a very very basic room with just a bed and two chairs.  the tv is good.  Nothing fancy.  Bathroom is nice and clean. BUT We dont regret staying here because the staff made our stay very comfortable.  They were there to attend to us every minute and did their best to keep us comfortable.  The service was prompt and good.   The staff there are more like a family and their children add to the homely atmosphere of this place. Now coming to the food, breakfast and dinner were very good and tasty.  They serve you with so much love and affection that you tend to ignore the small inconveniences that you may encounter.  We were even invited into the kitchen, which by the way",Kusuma B,/Profile/664kusumab,"Hyderabad, India",30
ladakh,"The rooms are clean, in a quiet environnent. I slept really well the night I stayed there. It was a bit of a struggle to get hot water in the shower though. Wi-fi was not working. But staff is really helpful and friendly. You have to know that when staying there, you will have to walk about 20 minutes to reach the center where all restaurants are.",Alexis D,/Profile/unenfantdumonde,"Annecy, France",40
