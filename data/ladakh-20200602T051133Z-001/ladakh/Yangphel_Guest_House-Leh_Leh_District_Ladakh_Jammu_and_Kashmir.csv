ladakh,We Stayed in Yangphel Guest House during the month of September for 4 days. They charged us around Rs.1800/- for 2 of us for room  and  for Break fast and dinner. When compared to other near by guest houses ( Dorje Guest House charge Rs. 850/ for 2 persons including BF and Dinner ) it was too  much. In Leh we can get a decent guest house for 2 people around Rs.1000/- including Breakfast and Dinner. So the Tariff is high. Their services are OK. The Persons working there are very nice ones. They Helped us in getting our Permits by charging Rs.100/- extra by  saving our time. Rooms are also not that much big enough.It is a nice Guest house but not worth the Tariff they charge.,rajkumar.r,/Profile/rrstallion,"Hosur, India",40

Having heard of them through some friends, I had made contact during my last trip in 2016 and shortlisted them for my next trip. As fate would have it, that trip only happened now in September 2019.   A group of three, we contacted Mr. Yayati and gave him our rough itinerary for his recommendations. Fortunately, He was able to sort out all our logistics for us. From our Airport transfers to our cab from Leh to Pangong, Tsomoriri and the numerous monasteries around Leh, Everything was organised for us. Even our stays on the road were organised by Mr. Yayati and whatever concerns we had, if any were quickly dispelled once we saw the properties he had organised for us.

What makes this place special are the people who host this guesthouse; the very gentle character of hospitality and small small kind gestures by Deepika and Yayati gives Yangphel a 'home like stay' touch. On my first day in Ladakh and at Yangphel, Deepika was kind enough to give me early check-in and she was such a sweet-heart to have given me a free upgrade to room with alluring mountain view.  The guesthouse has a very close proximity to the Leh main market of just around a pleasant 10 minutes walk.

It just felt like I'm spending time at house of my extended family.  They are always welcoming and eager to assist you in whatever problems you may have! Tell them what you want from the trip and the best advice will be given. Where to go, how to go, where to eat, what places to explore. Just amazing.

ladakh,"Me and my 3 other friends stayed at YangPhel guest house for 5 days in 2 rooms.  The owner was really down to earth and helped us in planning our road trip in and around Leh by suggesting us the options in hand, considering our timelines.  The manager in the Hotel is very cool, flexible and helped in planning our trip in and around Leh along with assurance of arranging bikes and taxis if needed, via his contacts!  The other staff too was really good in cooking the food and helping us in the daily activities.  Overall, very satisfied and I would strongly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a pocket-friendly , above par facilities and rooms.",srkg22,/Profile/srkg22,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,"The place is very good and Yayaati is a very helpful host. One of the cheaper but quality places in Leh.  It's in Upper Tukcha road which is just walking distance from main market and tourist attractions like Leh Palace & Shanti Stupa.  Another thing that stands out is how helpful and straight forward Yayaati is. He is quite resourceful, will tell you any flaws in your travel plans & suggests alternatives as well. He let us keep our bags in the hotel while we were out on bullet to visit Nubra and Pangong - free of cost! Not many people would have been so benevolent. Also when, by the time we returned, his rooms were all occupied, he even helped us find another place. Got us good discounts in booking the motorbikes. The list is quite long.  As for the rooms, it's not flashy or",Antony P,/Profile/390antonyp,,40

I would seriously recommend to have food at this guest house rather than going out in hotels and having. Hari, the best cook in Leh. On the whole I would seriously recommend everyone to go to Yangphel guest house for a great experience. And how can I forget the awesome view of the Ladakh Terrains from the rooms.

ladakh,"We booked this guest house for its location as shown on google maps, patches of green fields surrounding the place. Our luck was in our favour, it is a guest house situated amidst the lush greenery yet 5 minutes walk from Changspa and main market area. We met amazing people staying in the guest house. The roof of the guest house is a mini social point in the guest house. I spent my first day reserved for acclimatization chilling on the roof drinking mint tea and talking to everyone else living in the guest house. The guest house has a small kitchen garden, so the mint tea served is made form the fresh mint plucked from the garden. There are apricot and apple trees around.  The roof has an amazing view of the snow peaked mountains and the starry sky in the night. Not to forget",poortravelfreak,/Profile/poortravelfreak,"Singapore, Singapore",50

There is a terrace on the building, with a nice look on the mountains. The owner and the staff are very friendly. The owner is very helpfull (helping us plan our trip) and knows good english. He even helped us after our stay, when we stayed in another guesthouse (we had to move because Yangpel was fully booked for a group, but the owner helped us find another good alternative guestroom).

Being a bikers' group had its own perks, Mr. Yayaati and his superman 'Hari' makes us ponder often why are we not living in Leh.  Hospitality was too good, food is what you desire(options provided). Mr. Yayaati made sure we enjoyed our stay, he helped in our silliest of the travel dilemma. He is an excellent tour guide, a man with experience and fun to converse. Room prices were reasonable, he also guides and arranges for the places which can possibly visited around Ladakh. Nothing but the best of advises came from him.

After seaeching for almost 2 hours we found Yanghpel Guest House. Our host, Mr. Yayaati is a great person and gave us with some great ideas about the places to visit along with serving great food in his hotel. The rooms were very comfortable anf big enough for all of us. The bathrooms were clean with hot water all along which is absolutely necessary seeing the freezing weather of Leh. We stayed there for a couple of days before continuing our trip and while coming bavk also we stayed here only.

ladakh,"Just wanna say that if you are planning a trip to Leh, you got to stay at Yangphel Guest House. The reasons are many, but primarily the location of the guest house providing you a view of the Shanti Stupa on one side and the snow capped mountains (with frequent snow falls) on the other side. You cannot get a more relaxing view than this.   The service is always at your fingertips as the owner Yayaati Jeet Singh and his ever competant assistant Hari will be at your call 24 hours. Its not only the service, but the way they both provide you the service that makes this place stand out.

The location is very close to the city center (about 5 mins walk) and still very quiet. The room was in perfect condition when we reached Yangphel. Airport is 15 mins by Taxi. Rooms are spotlessly clean and large enough to feel yourself comfortable even for a long stay. We would like to mention that every detail and every corner of the interiors and exteriors are built with love and perfect taste.

The different criteria you can look for while choosing a place to stay could be hospitality of the host, location, cleanliness of the rooms and the budget.   Hospitality - 5/5 - Extremely helpful hosts in Yayaati and Hari. Always available with a smile on their faces, they make you feel like a part of their family. Yayaati with his invaluable personal experience and contacts in the area is always approachable to give you advice on things to do and places to visit.
