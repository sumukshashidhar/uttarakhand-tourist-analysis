ladakh,"It has been a horrifying experience at this place especially when the booking is made through reputed travel agents from Makemytrip.com.   After a 9 hour beautiful drive from Leh the only thing we expect is a good comforting place and people around to stretch our legs. This place fails in both.   We arrived at the place starving and expected some food available, but disappointed there was nothing. Upon asking for some food it was rudely refused. We requested for a glass of hot water which was reverted rudely that its not possible and then said it will take half an hour. We started hunting in that small place for some food and realised we would have to travel again to get food but since we were out of energy we decided to order at the hotel and agreed to make a payment.

ladakh,"I arrived rather late (evening 7pm) at Tsomoriri Lake and there were very limited options.  The hut seems quite new and clean but very, very basic. It seems to be made of cardboard-like material and very poor insulation.  The door can't close properly, cold air was coming into the hut and it was so cold at night (around 5 - 10 Degrees Celsius).   The huts are all facing inside and at each other. It is quite near to the lake but provided no views of the lake, stream or mountains.  However, the food is very good and the staff is very kind. They did not have hot water bottles or heater but they managed to arrange for an additional blanket for me. There is no hot water shower, but they offered to provide a bucket of hot water for shower.  It was just too depressing and I left to",Travel Chronicles of Ping,/Profile/TravelChroniclesPing,"Singapore, Singapore",20
ladakh,"This tin shed fixed structure resort at Tsomoriri lake. All the camps, resorts and hotels are fur from the lake. It is newly started and comfortable stay as the night was very chilled. All the staffs have taken good care of us. In the morning water was frozen in the pipe line and they have promptly served hot water from the kitchen. Food was good. My only suggestion to put thermocol or similar under the tin shed to avoid water seepage from the roof.",Sumit S,/Profile/sumit824,"Mumbai, India",30
