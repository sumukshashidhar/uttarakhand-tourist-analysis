ladakh,"We stayed at Skyland for more than 3 weeks in June-July 2017. Initially we were supposed to stay with them only for a couple of days, before our trek in Zanskar, but ended up in not wanting to leave them. For us (my husband and I) it was an amazing stay and I honestly have nothing bad to say about this guesthouse. What really makes it special are the people. And also the location, because it is walking distance from the center, in a more quiet area.  So let me start with the people. This place is owned by a Ladakhi-Australian family, a sweet couple that will do anything to make you feel at home. And they also have two Nepali guys, Sonam and Suraj, that help them with everything, along with Rigzin, the manager. They are all very friendly and you feel that they love what they do,",Andra P,/Profile/204andrap,"Bucharest, Romania",50
ladakh,"We stayed in the standard room for a few nights, firstly the room that we were given had construction going on right outside so it was noisy all day. They obliged and let us change our room. There are shared bathrooms and they were almost never cleaned, they just stayed dirty. The shower didn't work properly in one or the flush didn't work properly in the other. The room was quite dirty too, hair on the bedsheets and all kinds of crap stuck to the carpet. The wifi never worked for the 4-5 days we were there, I think they just didn't bother recharging it.  We found much better guesthouses for much cheaper just down the road. The breakfast was disappointing too. Their standard rooms require some serious cleaning and fixing. Maybe their deluxe rooms are in better conditions. Even",Karen D,/Profile/H9181POkarend,"Mumbai, India",20
ladakh,"I stayed in some great places while on my travels around India but Skyland was easily my favourite! I felt welcomed into the family from the moment I stepped through the gate to the time I had to leave. The staff (including Marley the beautiful, sooky Saint Bernard) and owners are happy to help in anyway they can, for me it was helping to organise a beautiful trip to Hunda on my very tight budget, advise on places to visit on a day trip to monasteries and places I could visit on foot. Skyland is central to all the spots to visit in Leh on foot and being 5 mins out of town meant quiet at night for a good sleep. The food was AMAZING as was the masala chai and ginger lemon honey tea (!!) and was really nice to eat dinner in the common room with different travelers most nights from",Aletch159,/Profile/Aletch159,,50
ladakh,"Tour arrangement      We were 10 adults +1 child visited leh. The whole tour package was arranged by sandup and Lynee of skyland guest house.

Two tempos were arranged by them one for leh and one from leh to srinagar. Drivers were just fantastic people and allowed our own space and didnt show any intent wen we took tons of photos everywhere.  Food :       Morning we were served bread omlet, chapathi ,fruit salads, toasted bread ,milk tea, cofee . apricot jam  butter.        lunch/dinner - dal chapathi veg curry rice pickle papad curd.  Food was good and",Srinivasan G,/Profile/SrinivasanG35,,50
ladakh,Stayed with guys for 2 weeks and didnt have to worry about a thing. Best way to see Ladakh as they can tailor to any request and have all the local knowledge one could hope for. The accommodation is basic but warm and the location is spot on - short walk to town and stupa's etc. Will return when I can for sure.,Dan,/Profile/Somanomah,"Paris, Ile-de-France, France",50
ladakh,"We were a group of 12 boys traveled from Mumbai to Leh. We were not looking for any luxury stay and booked skyland guest house this place was more than our expectations, Clean rooms very helpful staff Break fast was very good too. I would recommend this place for stay to most of my friends.",Kishor Sharma,/Profile/kish_king,Mumbai,40
ladakh,"I stayed in Skyland Guesthouse for just over a month over August & September 2015. I’m so glad I was recommended this place by a friend because it’s probably not somewhere I would have stumbled upon if I just arrived in Leh.  Skyland Guesthouse is located a short walk away from 3 tourist areas (pretty much in the middle of all the places you might want to go) This is definitely a good thing, if like me, you’re not a fan of staying right in the middle of the tourist area.  I stayed in both a room with an en suite and without, using a shared bathroom. Both were clean and had good running hot water. (Leh city as a whole does have power cuts from time to time so you will have to be okay with the occasional cold shower no matter where you stay) Totally worth the money to stay in a",Dileeni W,/Profile/dileeniw,"Sydney, Australia",50
ladakh,"Skyland Guest House turned out to be so good we stayed nearly 2 months. Lynne and Sandup welcome you like part of the family and so do the neighbours. The rooms are comfortable, clean and spacious. There's space to lounge around inside or a lovely garden to relax outside. Delicious meals can be served or it's only a few minutes to the centre of town and it's many restaurants and shops. If you want to get out and about Lynne and Sandup can give you plenty of advice, organise transport or create a tailor made itinerary for you. I can't wait till our next visit!",Lucy S,/Profile/420lucys,"Beverley, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"I was one of the first guests at Skyland Guest House, when parts of it were still under construction. Lynne and Sandup are awesome and helpful hosts, available at all times. Kuldeep, the chef, cooks pretty well too. The family environment was very comforting and I loved hearing stories of Leh from the hosts themselves.   Wi-Fi connectivity is poor all over Leh, but I found that the internet at Skyland was fast when the network did hold up.   While staying at a hostel in Leh is probably cheaper, I felt happy spending a little extra to stay here for its family environment (and their stories), quiet locale, AWESOME neighbours, good food, Sandup's help with sorting out my itinerary, and calming rooms.   As my first ever solo trip I learned that travel is about building connection",ishtaarth,/Profile/ishtaarth,"Chennai, India",50
