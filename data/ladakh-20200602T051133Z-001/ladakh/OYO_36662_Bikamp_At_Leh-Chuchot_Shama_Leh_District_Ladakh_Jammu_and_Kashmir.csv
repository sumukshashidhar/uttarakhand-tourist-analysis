ladakh,"Amazing place, away from the madenning crowd of tourists in leh, we had a great time spending time together with friends. They have lots of activities and games like fishing, frisbee, cricket, etc. All of us enjoyed their nature walk till river Indus and in evening awesome bonfire with music and barbecue. Very nice staff and helpful always ready to help. Food is great and highly highly recommended. Definitely recommend to every traveler to stay for a night or so to explore the best part of ladakh.",Devesh,/Profile/Deveshsikaria,,50
ladakh,"Bikamp Leh, no doubt, is the best camping site I have ever been to..Away in the quiet location; it's a beautiful, dreamy set - up. Views of mountains, the river flowing by, ample space for outdoor activities...We had a ""GALA"" as it was home for 3 days.  Clean and eco-friendly, delicious food and efficient, ever smiling staff...Highly recommended..  Had the best barbeque and bonfire night under the stars followed by the picnic next day...After ages, it was a perfect Sunday with everyone enjoying themselves...We never wanted to come back.  Thanks Ritesh and team for the hospitality and making our stay memorable :)",Deepika P,/Profile/294deepikap,,50
ladakh,"If Mr. Zaid Khan is present, I suggest you not taking this place as this guy can misbehave with your sister or wife for no reason. The owner is very great but was not present when a mishappening happed with us. The place is awesome, the Owner is great but this guy will ruin it. Just a suggestion from my side as this guy misbehaved with my wife & sister with no reason, we had to apologize just to make him calm but this guy threatened us that he is calling in some locals in the camp, we had to leave the camp at 11 pm, all money wasted. The mood was spoiled but we just let it go in order to continue our rest of the days. We too loved the place. SO please ensure before booking.",arungautam10,/Profile/arungautam10,"New Delhi, India",10

ladakh,"Located in the outskirts of Leh, this property is a bit difficult to search for. The camp is very beautiful but needs some effort from management to maintain it. The tentage  arrangement for stay is basic with each tent having a bed and attached toilet. The dining area and the food needs a lot of improvement.

ladakh,"We stayed here with our 14 friends. After spending 2 days in Leh City, we wanted a place away from city when we come back from Pangong, and guess what this is the place which we really wanted. Totally away from the traffic, greenery all around, ample amount of parking space, bonfire, tents and lovely dinner. What else do you need as a biker? And we had one of the best food here especially chicken Curry. I would strongly recommend all the riders to stay here. And if you are not a rider, see how a rider/biker camp looks like. :)",Sachendra Pal,/Profile/Sachendrapal,,50

ladakh,"Open sky, mesmerising view, stream by the side, away from the crowd, star gazing, bonfire, romance, adventure and very friendly owner and staff what else one could ask for. Our stay at Bikamp adventures was an experience in itself. We chose this place for the first day of our acclimatization as we didn't want to get locked inside our hotel room for the whole day. After reading it's reviews we decided that we can't find a better place to stay at Leh. This place is 20 Kms away from Leh airport and almost 17 kms from market. Which seem quite far but experiences always comes with a price. Bikamp has basic tents with bed and cot and washroom attached to it. These tents are not luxurious at all and we feel it's rawness makes it unique and compliment it's surroundings. Obviously those",Akansha2011,/Profile/Akansha2011,,50
ladakh,"The name Bikamp is in loop with The word Bikers,  Families and people looking for free wifi and other ameneties may not like it, but it is an awesome place, A stream flowing near by, reaching the camps on the bike is another adventure in its own, The Owner Ritesh being himself a biker knows what we really want, Overall it was a great experience, looking forward to coming in soon this year too, There is nothing really to complain about, so I wont give the owners any feedback to Improve, Thats just the way we love it, away from the crowd..

The helpfulness of staffs and the amenities are quiet good.   Bonfire was provided on request.. Since this place is far from city,  i would suggest directly booking with the property for their deals with meal The property has all the tents with two single beds rather than a double bed.   Tents were clean With attached toilets and had ample blankets..   The surrounding makes this place a perfect stay,  river on one side and mountains on the other..   The staff were very helpful.

When we reached there and we also were not knowing where the bikamp is, but when rites guided us to the location and we entered we all were ""that's the location should be!"". The site which is made for nature lovers, campers and adventurous people. Away from the city yet connected with people. We enjoyed our stay at the fullest. And Ritesh is the hero. He will help you in everything, by getting something from Leh city or to get permission for further routes. He is the solution himself.

Indus river is quite close to the property and there is a small stream which flows right behind the camp site. The owner/Manager of the property Ritesh is a friendly guy so is the rest of the staff. They would try their best not to say no. Camps are small but cosy, linens and towels provided were very clean. The bathrooms are pretty small and their was no space for a tall guy like me to take a shower(I'm six feet tall), they do not have running hot water but they provide a bucket of hot water per person in the morning.

The camping site is located a few kms away from the bustling town of Leh and is an ideal place to stay and get refreshed before the amazing ladakh tour. It is a nice place for bikers to camp particularly for those who come through the Manali Leh highway and even for those who land in Leh directly. Bikamp Adventures is a destination in itself where one feels close to nature amidst enchanting spring water streams that join the Indus river nearby, clean camp sites, extremely helpful staff and off course the delicious food served.

The food there was amazing and  we really liked the accommodations that the camp made for us. For ex. one night it was pouring when we got back, so they served us hot food in our tent, right were we stayed. And it turned into an intimate dinner with friends and we ended staying up into the night chatting. The camp was helpful to us in finding a good driver and also planning our itinerary.

Though the river was muddy when we went there due to heavy rains, we have heard that it usually remains crystal clear during other parts of the year. Since it is a camping site it will be stupidity to expect super clean tents and surrounding areas.  Ritesh is a supportive person who will help you arrange for camp fire and will happily click pictures for you.

Since there are no boards on the main road indicating the way, we had to spend more than half an hour of asking around and going back and forth, before we located the turn. Once we got off the main highway and crossed the Indus, the beauty and remoteness of the place struck us. It is an ideal camping site for bikes, and cars may not be able to come all the way to the camp. It is run by Ritesh, who did a great job in setting up the tents and in making us feel comfortable.
