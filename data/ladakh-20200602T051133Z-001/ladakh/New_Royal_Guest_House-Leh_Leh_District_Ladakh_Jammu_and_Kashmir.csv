ladakh,"We stayed at New Royal Guest House for 4 nights at the end of May 2019. We have stayed at many hotels in India, and nowhere has been as helpful and accommodating as this small guest house - and we have stayed at some 4 star hotels. The manager, Gyatso, was even answering my emails back in March when my wife and I were planning the trip. Nobody else has been this responsive. I was in contact with him several days before we arrived and he had a representative waiting for us at the airport. From the moment we arrived our stay was great. He organized everything for us, including inner line permits, motorcycle rental for our trip to Khardong La, and trip to Pangong Lake. Usually this level of service means $$$$, but the prices were very affordable for the service we received.",jdgullett,/Profile/jdgullett,"Huntsville, Alabama",50
ladakh,We stayed for 7 nights and where very happy here. Good value for money. Relaxed and comfortable. Nice quiet location and just a short 5 minute walk down into town. 10 minutes back! Staff where friendly. Gyatso in particular was very helpful and knowledgeable. Great views from terrace and a good view of the palace from our room. Judging by some of the reviews everyone has different experiences of the place but we‚Äôd be more than happy to stay here again. ,Akdor1,/Profile/Akdor1,"London, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"Excellent Guest House! Great hospitality, helpfull staff, tasty meals, close to the market...! Next time we gonna stay at the same place... Free Wi-Fi. Quiet area. Safe parking. Definitely recomended üòâüëç",Sub_ADV,/Profile/Sub_ADV,"Nowy Sacz, Poland",50
ladakh,"Well, the breakfast is ok, but it could be more varied. Not selling beer is too bad:-(   Expect cheap and 'alright' accomodation, friendly and helpful staff and a nice sun terrace with a stunning view to the stok group including one of the highest mountains, the stok kangri (6153m alt.) Wifi is working, but only in Leh (I mean in whole Leh) the Internet is down like half of the time... The city is in a short walking distance, but nevertheless you are not in a crowded area, so there is no noise during night time.",jascheissdiewandan,/Profile/jascheissdiewandan,,40
ladakh,Don't book and waste your time. I had booked 2 rooms and on arrival were told by the guy that bathrooms were not functional..Generally avoid guest houses as these are run unprofessionaly and basic hot water is also an issue at most locations.,Manbir G,/Profile/manbirg,,10
ladakh,"We arrived to this guest house after a 12 hour drive from Jispa and they had given our room away. We had booked through Bookings.com one week in advance and specifically booked the ONLY room with a private balcony. On arrival they showed us to an entirely different room and claimed all their rooms are with shared balcony only, however, we could clearly see the room we had booked from outside. We asked to speak to the manager, whom also claimed they didn't have any private balcony rooms. Both people we dealt with were totally unapologetic and basically lied to us as they had given the room we reserved away. I would warn other travellers not to rely on a pre-booked room here.",Lillie L,/Profile/lillierl,"Ubud, Indonesia",10
ladakh,"The management is very unprofessional. They are a bunch of liars, greedy and lack a conscience.  We had booked the deluxe room with balcony for 2 nights and arrived here after a long drive of 12hrs from Jispa, only to find that our room had been given to someone else. They showed me the printout of our booking and showed us a basic room stating that it was the same as what we had booked. When I pointed out that ours was with a balcony the manager and the owner blatantly lied that they didn't have any such rooms. You can see the balcony on the first floor in their photos. . . Very disappointing, they're giving the hospitality and warmth of Leh a bad name.",Manvendra S,/Profile/ManvendraS105,,10
ladakh,"Everything in the hotel was great. Only 1 staff can speak english and have only easy dinner because we went in low season. You can walk to the main market, can ask for heater, also have hot water but !!! the owner came in to my room without told me in a day time to take the sofa out. Leave me only a dust under a sofa without clean anything in my room. After I complain 2 times with his staff ,he apologize and offer me a new room.  He miss the point that he came in to my room without tell me before ,he just said he sorry and he had to fix the sofa. You should think twice if you want to stay here.",peeraya c,/Profile/788peerayac,"Bangkok, Thailand",40
ladakh,"Stayed 3 nights , good central location, clean hotel except toilet had leaks and smell of insecticide , nice garden, ok room and facility's. Staff ok but lack communication skills felt they were not very interested which compared to other Leh places means you can stay elsewhere for greater interaction And peace",Richard1901,/Profile/Richard1901,"Whangarei Heads, New Zealand",30
ladakh,"Great experience of my staying. All staff, especially Mr.Gyatso, are very kind, helpful and friendly. My room was nice, served with warm bed and blankets, private bathroom with water heater.  Chicken fried rice by Mr.Dorjae is my most favorite dish from the guest house kitchen. Looking forward to go back again someday :)",Namthip K,/Profile/namthipk2017,,40
ladakh,"We spent three nights here and while we thought the room was nice (clean, well equipped, great view), the service left a lot to be desired. There is no reception area so you need to search for someone each time you need assistance, and the people who help you speak little English and act very disinterested. Further, we went on a five day trek and reserved a room for our last night; however, when we got back from the trek we found the room had been rented to someone else, so we needed to find new accommodation. We also found that our bags - which we had left at the guesthouse - had been put in a room where a friend of the owners was staying, who clearly did a lot of smoking with the doors and windows closed. Thus when we retrieved our bags, they smelled strongly of cigarettes. As",Daphnee C,/Profile/594daphneec,"Jakarta, Indonesia",30
ladakh,i stayed in this guest house with my husband. our room was clean and washroom was very clean and hygenic. location is near to the market. food was good and the staff was very friendly. Mr. Jaffar is extremely friendly and helped us in getting  good package for our nine day leh trip.  we were very much satisfied with our overall expeirence with new royal guest house and Mr. Jaffar.,shipra_painuly,/Profile/shipra_painuly,,50
ladakh,We took budget a room with shared bathroom. It was quite clean. The washroom had hot water facility. The location was great as it was 1-1.5 KM from the main market hence away from the hullabaloo yet accessible enough if you want to hit the market area.,kanan p,/Profile/626kananp,,40
ladakh,"Nice room with good decorations  and clean bathroom. However no hot water during our one night stay.   Our room was not ready when we arrived. The staff who can't understand English bring us to a double room, even though we booked a room for three. The manager was not around. When the manager back, they bring in an extra bed.   About 10 mins walk to the market.",Tok Wae,/Profile/TokWae,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",40
ladakh,"Nice place to stay. Only the caretaker is something of a smartass, other than that no complaints. Beware of availability of hot water during cloudy days.Solar heated water may not available ask for geyser to be turned on in the room.",Dipanjan B,/Profile/DipanjanB39,,30
ladakh,"I and my wife  we travelled to Leh on 4th April, our stay from the Day 1 with this property was Horrible, First day went fine as we had enough rest as advised on the day of arrival, on next day me and my wife had acute mountain sickness, and we have been taken by the taxi driver to the hospital, they have been with us till the time we were able to walk on our feets...we arrived at the guest house post 12 AM and guess what the guest house was locked, we have been shouting, knocking the doors, banging, now one came up to open the doors, so we both were standing outside in the freezing weather, then the taxi driver jumped inside to open the door from inside, the moment we both went inside after two hours thinking to have some sleep as  doctor advised us, but the horrible part was",ranaanubhav2002,/Profile/ranaanubhav2002,"New Delhi, India",10
