The rooms have most amazing cloud beds, with the best linen, beautifully done up interiors. Food is great and all the staff perfectly warm and accommodating. Best place to stay in Leh, just 15 minutes from the centre of the city in a peaceful location. Look forward to going back there !",buddy376,/Profile/buddy376,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"Calm...soothing....peaceful...comfortable...relaxing...a spa for the soul...this is how I would rate my recent stay at the Woodyvu Stok House. Despite being a bit quizzing, the location of this property is absolutely superb, away from the maddening crowds of Leh. It's a fantastically restored old Ladakhi house & worthy of being known as one of the best accommodation options in the region. The staff is honest, very cooperative, & went the extra mile to make my stay memorable. A special mention of praise for Nima Sherpa for his hospitality. A word of advise to the management of the property - an introduction of authentic Ladakhi/Tibetan cuisine in the menu would be very refreshing & most welcome.",Navin K,/Profile/NavinK355,,50
ladakh,"This amazing property is just 15 to 20 mins away from Leh airport. Although in remote location but that’s what the USP is of this property that it’s seculuded from the city hustle bustle and located in between of trees, mountains and breathtaking view. Such a serene place and rooms are very quaint and cozy! Food is amazing too. They’ll serve you in way you’ll feel that you’re at home, Cz they’ll fulfill you wish to eat whatever you want and it will taste like home. Moreover the there’s a guy named ’Nimma Sherpa’ he’s a gem of person there. His hospitality is at next level. He’ll treat you like anything, with a smile on his face 24*7. He took care of us, and served us like a Michelin Star like hospitality. Cheers for him. I would suggest this property very much!!",Ashish R,/Profile/Nomad55831525755,,50

Its a great way to start you Leh experience as you rest and take small walks in the garden to acclimatize to the high altitude. Leh City is now crowded and the blaring of horns and people everywhere.

The rooms are large, have 4 poster beds and are tastefully done up. he view from the rooms are also spectacular.   Its a slightly smaller property with just 4-6 rooms which also ensures adequate privacy and focus from the service staff. The hospitality & food on the 2 days for which we stayed at WoodyVu was also top notch.  However, the place is very far from the main city of Leh and is not well connected. Also the tariff is very high as compared to the quality of rooms. Being situated in such a remote location with virtually no shops/ hang out places in the vicinity - the limited hours of operation of the restaurant is also a concern.

Its quite to the interior, around 35 min from the airport in stok village. defiantly a breath taking view, but the marks for that would defiantly go to the nature and not the the cottage.

ladakh,"I was focussed on assuring a comfortable yet an authentic ladakhi experience in choosing my stay in Leh. With some research on the local experiences and how the topography of Leh is laid out, I made it a point not to go the conventional way in staying in a property in Leh town. So we zeroed in on the beautiful secluded home stay from WoodyVu properties in the adjacent village of Stok and aptly called the WoodyVu stock House.   Since we were flying in and out of Leh (and not opting for the much fancied road trip), the location seemed distant to us from and to the airport.   During our visit, we realised its worth the money as Leh now seems to be very crowded and the hotels there do not offer anything drastically distinct like WoodyVu.

The rooms are self sufficient and big and very tastefully made. All the furniture is locally made or sourced, hence gives you a complete local feeling.

ladakh,"Well the first impression of this hotel is - 'what is it?' Is it a home stay? Or is it a hotel?  If we categorise this as a homestay, it lacks the following -  1. It has no family which makes you feel the local culture. 2. It doesnt offer any local authentic cuisine that one would expect to experience during homestay. 3. Its only a 5 bedroom house in a village converted into a hotel/guest house. 4. And you would just not pay this much for any homestay in all of Ladakh.  If we categorise this as a hotel, it lacks the following -  1. It has no tv, intercom, or any such basic facility a hotel provides.  2. The room service, house keeping, etc are maintained by 2-3 staff which are often known as helpers at our homes.  3.

Melvin for being exceptionally kindhearted and making sure we got whatever we needed. Also Lundup and Jogi whose hospitality and warmth guided us through the cold.

It was one of our most memorable moments in Leh. The food was mostly vegetarian but very tasty.

The surroundings are absolutely serene and exquisite with a complete view of the mountain ranges and being set in a village it also gives you a flavour of the Ladakhi culture. WoodyVu is not a pure play hotel, it’s a traditional ladakhi house that's been organically evolved into a very comfortable stay with all the amenities without significantly altering its core aesthetics. The good thing is that you are completely cut-off from the outside world as you don't have any televisions or data connectivity and wi-fi setup that hardly ever works (a blessing in disguise).

If you are into nature walks , spectacular sights and brilliant visual appeal, I would strongly advise you to make this as your base instead of a hotel in Leh. The reason being that Leh does not offer the sights and sounds like this home stay. It will add an extra half an hour for your excursion to NUbra ( not Pangong , Thiksey , Hemis ) but it's so charming that it's well worth the effort.
