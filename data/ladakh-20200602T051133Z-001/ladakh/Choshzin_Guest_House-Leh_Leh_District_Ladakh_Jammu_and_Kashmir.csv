ladakh,"The hotel is perfect in every respect exept for its location. I had to search for nearly half an hour, with my cab driver, before I spotted the hotel. The room was small, but clean and warm. The manager was very cordial and helped me with the luggage. He also offered a free airport-drop in his private car on the day I left.",Aban Sheer,/Profile/AbanS193,"West Bengal, India",40
