ladakh,"The boss is welcoming but the employers were no Friendly, lazy and unpolite. There is only one shower for a dormitory of 10 beds and the workers didnt want we use the washroom after 9pm because we disturb them with the Light. The second night, the boss wasnt here and we didnt have electricty. So we cant use WiFi, dont take a shower, no Light in the rooms. But noboby were looking a solution. They prefer look videos on them phones. They didnt want call the boss. They says us no house had electrity in the town. So we d√©cide to leave the Hostel at 10pm. We find other Hostel for the same price with electricity, all amenities and smiles.  So dont book in this Hostel.

ladakh,"to say Juniper Guest house is complete value for money is not saying enough. Apart from being super easy on the pocket, you get to meet the sweetest couple, who are running the place. The place is adorable, the rooms are super comfortable, they don't have heating but their warm welcome and attitude makes up for it. They have all sorts of options to choose from, double, single, triple and dorms. I definitely recommend this place for people travelling on a budget, who want to be hosted by a lovely family and meet some amazing people while staying there. Also, Bon Appetite (a very popular joint) is in their backyard, so on a cold night you literally have to take a few steps to grab a meal in case you want to go out.",Nikita K,/Profile/FarAway691884,,50

Professionally managed by Tahira aunty and Retired Col. Smanla. The room tariffs are bare minimum( Rs. 1,500/-) and the supporting staff Haider, Zainab etc. are very supportive. The only issue I felt was lack of parking at the guest house as you have to park your bike outside on Road with no security. Car parking is impossible as the approach road is very narrow even difficult to manoeuver bike. Rooms are big with sufficient lights thanks to large windows.

The rooms are big with spacious bathrooms. Though the geyser is present only in one room rest of the rooms have the hot water running through solar water heaters.

ladakh,"This is an a bit  longer review, but read it anyway! Having been in Ladakh for a mixed trekking-visiting (Thikse-Hemis-Alchi-Lamayuru-Likir-Basgo- etc.) four weeks stay I changed in Leh to the Juniper Guesthouse. When coming back to Ladakh next year I will stay for sure again in that GH. Why? 1. Building. Juniper guesthouse is a pretty new building, so it is spacious and modern planned. 2. Location. The Juniper is located in short comfortable walking distance (3-5 minutes) to the Leh centre (Main Bazar), where ""the music plays"". It is built off the driving roads, so it is quiet (for me very important). 3. Rooms. I lived before and after trekking-visiting in three rooms (101,102 and the nephews).

We searched for a place to stay on TripAdvisor and I'm so glad we chose here.  The owners (Auntie and Uncle) were incredible, immediately making you feel at home.  The atmosphere was very relaxed and the other guests very generous (we borrowed all our hiking stuff from another guest who had just finished her trip and was taking a few days to recover).  On top of that the food was ridiculous.  I can't speak highly enough of breakfasts of puri with potato curry or the dinners with daal and a chicken curry I wish I'd got the recipe for.

I travelled with my husband and another couple friends of ours and stayed there for three nights. The place is very well maintained and feels always fresh. Considering it is tucked in in Leh, hot water requirement is never a problem here. There are about 13 rooms in total and all are well maintained and have all facilities you would want in a place to stay. About the hosts, the colonel and aunty are both super welcoming and you would instantly like them.

Plus the central location of this house is a big advantage with lot of restaurants and local travel agencies around.

Aunty's cooking makes everything perfect, is prepared from organic vegetables grown in her garden and with a lot of love. I was given a more than spacious room for my stay there and if I ever had any need they were available.

The hosts are a welcoming team of a married couple affectionally  known as Uncle and Auntie.  Location is great, 5 mins walk to the main square and the hub of cafe and restaurants. It's off the main road so the traffic noise is considerably reduced, only cows and the odd motorbike to contend with in the backyard lanes leading to the entrance.  Rooms are clean to an exceptional standard for a guest house in this price range. We stayed on the second floor and the bathroom was nearly new.

They organised our pick up and drop to the airport and even planned our itinerary! It is a 2 minute walk from the main road where the car leaves you.

ladakh,"Located in changspa, juniper Guest house is a gem. It is one of the best places to stay if you are visiting leh. You are greeted by the owner who comes across as a very caring person. They go out of their way to ensure your comfort. The rooms are well done and boast of modern architecture. They are comfortable and offer some breathtaking views of the mountains. Offers complimentary WIFI. Has an atm which is close to the guest house which is extremely convenient.  Overall a very comfortable stay with exceptional service.
