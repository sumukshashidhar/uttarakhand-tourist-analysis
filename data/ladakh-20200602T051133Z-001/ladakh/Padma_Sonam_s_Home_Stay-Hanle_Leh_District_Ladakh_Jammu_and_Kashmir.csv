ladakh,"Padma Home Stay is probably the best, if not only, place to stay in the small village of Hanle, which is often visited by adventure lovers.  Unfortunately, Hanle was not allowed during Apr-Jun of 2018 by Indian Army and we were not very sure if we shall get the permit to visit Hanle during July 2018. Hence, in spite of knowing the demand of Padma Home Stay, we didn't pre-book the room. Luckily, we got the permit to visit Hanle and went to the hotel without reservation. We are lucky to get a 4-beded room, which is basic one; but as expected in the remote place like Hanle. However, Sonam, the owner of the Home Stay, told us, even if the hotel is fully booked, some arrangement is usually made if they have a guest. They sometimes make a bed in the dining hall too, to accommodate",Sayantani Chatterjee,/Profile/SayantaniC,"Hyderabad, India",50
ladakh,"This review is for stay in 3rd week for November.  The guest house is located in Hanle village. We occupied one 4 bed and one 5 bed room. The 5 bed room doesn't have attached toilet. Being winter only 3 rooms out of 9 were operational. Third one is also 4 bed with attached toilet. Even though we had booked 2 rooms with attached toilet, one of them was given to other tourist couple so we have to settle with the 5 bed room. One 4 bed room has traditional heater on wood so that heats fast but last short. So it runs only till 11:00-11:30PM. Other two rooms have kerosene based heater that can go till morning. On arrival we were served with hot tea and biscuits. Dinner (Dal, roti, subji, rice) was ready by 8PM. Food was good. Next day breakfast was bread-butter-jam, roti, omlet.",Rajanish T,/Profile/JajaborRaj,"Pune District, India",40
ladakh,The place is owned by Mr. Sonam Dorjay and is located at a distance of 250 kilometers from Leh. The road to Hanle from Leh leads you through the border town of Chushul and the Rezang La. One has to hold Inner Line Permits and special permission from the DC office for visiting Hanle. Foreign tourists are not allowed on this route owing to the proximity to the Indo-China border.,Lovers_paradise,/Profile/Lovers_paradise,new delhi,40
ladakh,"We stayed in Hanle with this guest house. Food is very good but they give accommodation in newly constructed rooms where only one window is there. So little bit problem of suffocation otherwise it is the best option to stay. Hanle is the most beautiful place in overall, I have seen in total Ladakh except some individual beauty. Best part of Hanle was the road from crossing Nyoma Bridge to Hanle. We have seen Rock Eagle and 2 birds which our driver Nasser Bhai(+91 94195 44606) One of the most experience driver in This region. As people usually get confused while driving from Pangong Lake to Nyoma. Naser is such a experienced driver and he is also associated with Rigzin Dada well known Driver who arranged our trip. I here let people know about Naser because this is the first place",Arghya Mukhopadhyay,/Profile/Arghya19,"Kolkata, India",40
ladakh,It's one of the better homestays in Hanle. The rooms are very comfortable and food decent. Mr. Sonam who owns the homestay and his wife Padma are great hosts and very  helpful. It is quite close to some of the birding spots and if you happen to visit in the right season you could get to see the Black Necked Cranes quite close and also the Tibetan Larks,riteshjoshi10,/Profile/riteshjoshi10,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"This was my second visit here and remains the best option in Hanle. The homestay is named after the lady Padma and her husband, Sonam, remains an awesome host. Hanle is one of the remotes villages in this part of the world and taking that into consideration, the facilities provided are awesome. They built a new set of rooms last year and these are cosy with attached loos. Dining area remains warm and cosy. Ample parking, mini shop inside premises, diesel on demand and power back up too! You will have to drive 500 mtrs away for proper BSNL signal though ",BunnyPunia,/Profile/BunnyPunia,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"We as group of bird watchers, stayed at Padma's homestay in Hanle on 9th August 2016, our last destination in Ladakh tour. The landlady Padma welcomed us with her ever smiling face and served us hot tea within no time. We stayed in newly constructed rooms which were clean, warm and specious with attached toilet just beyond our expectation as far as Hanle is considered as remote place in India. Despite of no power, they provide generator power back up couple of hours in evening and morning which was a bonus point for us. Also Padma offered us hot water in thermos in every room which was much required when you are in Ladakh, The most exciting place in this home stay was dining area and most spectacular site was a table with well organised utensils on it coupled with few",AsianFairyBlue,/Profile/AsianFairyBlue,Pune,50
ladakh,"It is advocated by Devil on Wheels (DOW), Broken Moon etc and so no wonder it does make up for the deficits you face in Hanle. There are only 4 rooms with only one having an attached bathroom. You really don't have any option in food as it is one of the most secluded areas in Ladakh and the family is of nomadic origin. They do provide Chang on request Also, visit the two monasteries and the Indian Astronomical Observatory",Arihant J,/Profile/ArihantJ78,,40
ladakh,"After a tiring ride to Hanle (Hanlay) deep down towards China in Ladakh, this is a most welcome homestay facility; decent rooms, very hospitable couple running it, good food. And, of course, some spectacular landscapes around to walk / ride around in. Padma the owner has excellent weaving skills (ask to see her rugs/shawls), and is a great cook. Sonam her husband works at the Hanle Observatory, and can tell you about great places around to see (including wildlife).",Ashish Kothari,/Profile/chikikothari,"Pune, India",40
ladakh,"30th of August 2015 : The homestay is a little tricky to find in the small town of Hanle in the Ladakh Region. However, there are boards/ road signs put up by the Homestay owners which you will need to watch out for. Mr. Sonam and his wife Mrs. Padma are the owners and provide excellent hospitality.  Rooms :There are only 4 rooms in the Homestay. 2 Rooms have attached bathrooms, whereas 2 rooms need to share a common toilet. We were 9 of us and had to squeeze in the 2 Rooms with a Common Toilet as the other 2 rooms were already occupied. Fun in it's own way and something to be remembered and cherished for the times to come. The beds are comfortable for a night's sleep and that's all about it.  Nights are pretty cold and I would suggest you to carry some good woolen wear if",ARAV-ESHITA,/Profile/ARAV-ESHITA,"Kolkata, India",30
ladakh,"We reached Hanle at around 3:30 pm and were to surprised to find the only Guesthouse locked. After shaking the gates and shouting Bhayya, Bhayya - the caretaker emerged from the opposite house.  The owner was away due to some personal emergency. Mr. Paljor, a relative of the owner was our host. He always sported a smile on his face and cooked whatever we asked for.  Since, we took the Chushul route from Pangong, there were no restaurants on the way. By the time we reached the homestay, all of us were hungry.  The quilts provided were very comforting (experienced snow fall 2 times at Hanle). The food was good. The rooms were clean.  Only point to improve - The common toilet can be converted from Indian style to Western style  Awesome hospitality at such a remote place",TheWallStands,/Profile/TheWallStands,"Ithaca, New York",50
ladakh,"The rooms were great; very neat; with thick quilts and carpeted floor. There were 4 beds, with a western style attached bathroom. Hot water was given to us in buckets when asked for, all with a smile :) Sonam, the proprietor of the home-stay (actually a guest house now) served us always with a smile. The rooms were cheap, with 500 rupees a bed, and food was good with breakfast, lunch and dinner at 200 rupees per person a day all served with a smile :)   Hanle in Changthang region of Ladakh is one of the most beautiful, enchanting, and calm places in India. Hanle has a lovely Hanle Monastery offering some great aerial views of whole village that is a home of about 1000 people. The views from the top of monastery are just breath-taking. Hanle also houses an Indian Astronomical",Nivedita C,/Profile/niveditac2013,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",50
