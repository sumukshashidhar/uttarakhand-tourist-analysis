ladakh,The hotel is situated at good location. hotel staff is good. But the hotel is highly overpriced. Food is way too expensive Intercom was not working. The rooms are very dark. Only good thing is the parking space else the hotel could be skipped ,Jatin T,/Profile/JatinT33,,30

ladakh,"Best thing about the hotel is it is next to the main market. Everything is available nearby. Rooms and bathrooms are spacious, however, quite an old hotel need renovation. Overall good experience in leh.",Ravish M,/Profile/Ravish1,"Ahmedabad, India",30
ladakh,We were a group of 6 friends who stayed here during our trip to Ladakh. The service is good and rooms are clean. WiFi is available and it is very close to markets and restaurants. The hotel staffs also assist us in getting good cabs/drivers and help us plan our itinerary.,shyamala m,/Profile/shyamalam,"Chennai, India",40

ladakh,"Stayed in July 2015 for 2 nights. It was pleasant stay in deluxe room - no view though. Right on the market area, so everything is accessible very easily.   Room was good and clean, but restroom was not so clean. Food needs improvement as well. Staff's were good and helpful. During our complete stay, wifi didn't work - but it is same with other hotels as well - so, no complaints. Recommended for staying 1-2 nights.",Suvra,/Profile/Suvra_2505,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,"You will certainly find a better place than this in Leh. Very basic hotel, untidy and old. Location could be a plus but rest all negatives makes it a show spoiler. Food wasn't up to the mark either. Hot water is limited",sayam123,/Profile/sayam123,,10

ladakh,"This is one of the oldest hotels of this place but they have lost their charm. Its in a wonderful location but poor staffs and not properly maintained. We stayed for a day and shifted to other hotel. Its not worth of paying for staying in such a dirty, poorly maintained hotel. I would suggest all the travelers to stay in any guest house around leh main market. They are cheap and well maintained.   Hope they improve in future.",The Finest Soldier,/Profile/TheFinestSoldier,"Farwaniya, Kuwait",20
ladakh,"This is good hotel to stay both for family and friends.The hotel is good for a day or two to stay and is also very near to most of the market places,restaurants. This hotel is also near for bike and car rentals area. This hotel opp we have got 2enfield rental shops. Hotel has got good ambiance restaurant but bit costly so we preferred to have outside after 1st day stay. Cleanliness wise its quite good but i felt bathrooms could be still better looks bit old.",yogi2806,/Profile/yogi2806,"Bengaluru, India",40

ladakh,Good place with WiFi facility. Huge parking facility inside the hotel premises. Located in centre of the market. You can bargain on room tariff in off season. Food in hotel is some costly as compare to other restaurants nearby.,s_abhiman,/Profile/s_abhiman,"Mumbai, India",40

Rooms are huge and clean ... Overall extremely happy wit the service... Would highly recommend this place ... ,AnilSalian,/Profile/AnilSalian,Pune,50

ladakh,"This isn't your stay when you are on a holiday to chill and laze around in a quaint place. This is like a convenient option to dump your baggage after a long-long drive from Srinagar/ Manali and get some rest without bothering much to look for a good place to stay. It's bang opposite to the taxi stand and is a no brainer when you are just looking for a roof above your head. We stayed here for a day and later shifted to a better place called the New Royal Guest House which is a 10 minutes' walk from here, cheaper and way better.  This hotel isn't too bad if you are okay living in the thick of inner city hustle and bustle. Don't expect any views from your window though because there is none. If you are on a quick vacation and want everything at your arm's length, be it",SoumitraBhattacharya,/Profile/SoumitraBhattacharya,"Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,"I stayed at this hotel in 1982. It has stayed with me for all these years as one of my most wonderful travel experiences. I had flown in not knowing anything about Leh and a young woman by the name of Rana Sajad offered me a lift from the airport. I wasn't sure of this, so I walked the considerable distance. On arrival at her hotel, the only one open in winter, she welcomed me and escorted me to a neat little room. The room tariff was as much as the firewood, little more than twigs, and the bucket of water steaming each day was only lukewarm, the outside temperature being so cold. On departure, Rana ran after me and gave me a gift that I have treasured all these years to remember her by as her friend. What a beautiful place. The memories will last a lifetime.",GoannaSydney,/Profile/GoannaSydney,Sydney,50
ladakh,Khangri Hotel is a very average hotel in leh. Location is the main attraction of this property. its close to all the restaurant areas of leh. right in the middle of everything. stay here if you can get the rooms at a nominal price... hotel gets very expensive in summer making it poor value.,sayadil,/Profile/sayadil,"New Delhi, India",30
ladakh,"location was the main attraction for this hotel. the town centre and the shoppings, eating and the internet cafe were conveniently located close to the hotel. the whole town centre was being excavated for some reasons with no health and safety hazard signs the dust in the air was therefore natural. this is one of the founding hotels in Leh and the new addition to the property has given it a face lift.",Mohammad M L,/Profile/mohammadml,,40

ladakh,"Recently had chance to visit Leh on a business trip & had a chance to stay at hotel Khangri. Please do not have very high expectations ffrom the property in terms of the in-house facilities as you may find in hotels in other cities. Location wise it is very well located, right in the middle of the main market, in the heart of the city. Overall an average place to stay.",Sanjay51,/Profile/Sanjay51,"New Delhi, India",30
ladakh,"We really liked the hospitality of the staff here, though the hotel might be a bit on the expensive side. Rooms were good, however, getting hot water was a challenge. The hotel is also located conveniently close to the market and the Leh Palace, which makes the stay here easier for shoppers.",tsniranjan,/Profile/tsniranjan,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,"Beware, they do not accept credit cards. This had caused problems for us. They do not provide toiletries except one soap for the entire duration. Towels are changed every day but not always cleaned thoroughly. Food is very basic and non-veg items are bad. They do not have electricity in the nights and early morning. Hot water has to be requested in the evenings. There is no phone line in the morning.The location is great and the hotel is clean. The staff very helpful and friendly too. On the whole, stay in the hotel if there is no other place available.",Neil91,/Profile/Neil91,"London, United Kingdom",20
ladakh,"We booked this hotel during our 8 day trip to Leh. It is one of the many hotels situated in the main market in Leh.  It is closer to the ATM, main market where you can do lot of shopping, and many good restaurants. What makes the stay worthwhile is that the rooms are clean, have spacious bathrooms with hot water facility in the morning and evening,  the hotel stuff are very friendly and helpful. The manager arranged car and a friendly friver for our site seeing and provided us decent discounts on these tours as well. The hotel has a small but beautiful rose garden. The in-house restaurant has decent food options. Try their crispy pakodas with afternoon tea, and you know what I mean.  Cons : Being situated in the main market, you may not have the best views of the mountains from",SDwibedi,/Profile/SDwibedi,"New Delhi, India",40
