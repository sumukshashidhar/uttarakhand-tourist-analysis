ladakh,A good place to stay - food is nice. No heating facility but cottages are worth staying. Electricity is a problem and wifi is hardly available - but thats the same over all in the valley. Short drive to sand dunes and camel ride.A must stay,Manish C,/Profile/ManishC626,,40
ladakh,"This hotel is spread hardly in 400 sq meter area and cottages are just a hand away from each other..you could listen the gossips of other room easily in then night...LOL  Anyways huts were good and clean. Food was also delicious. Its a good option if you are looking for budget accommodation. 10 mins drive from your lodge to the Hunder dunes.  Best part is when you sit outside your hut, the view you get is a wide range of high rise mountains..."" Dil ko sukoon milta h: :D",Anoop Shekhawat,/Profile/AnoopS637,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"We were a part of a 18 person's group, had a really nice time. The staff is great and very co-operative. The cottages are new with all the necessary amenities. Food was good and the sound of the stream flowing at the back of the cottages, surreal. Good work guys, thanks again.",vivek mishra,/Profile/vivekjmg,"Kolkata, India",50
