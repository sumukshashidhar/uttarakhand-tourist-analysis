Big, spacious rooms,  good view,  terrace,  opportunity to see sky full of stars,  and yes we saw the milky way too...  The food was excellent. We were there almost 8days and never were we disappointed. But thats not all ...If I don't mention the names of the Ratna team - Tashi,  Diskit and Erica it would not make any sense. They were very good,  hospitable,  always calm and cool,  satisfying all our needs,  remember ours was a big group,  and there were two more big groups like us to participate at Ladakh Marathon.

ladakh,"I stayed twice in Ratna once in April, 2018 and again in September, 2018. One of the most striking thing is you feel that you are treated like a family member when you stay in Ratna. Tashi, who runs the place is very friendly and takes care of anything and everything you need during your stay including all the tours. To me by far the best treat was the breakfast and dinners I had there. Sharmaji, who is in charge of kitchen is a superb cook ans prepares whatever you want and is a great host.  Finally, you can’t beat the location. It is away from town and has a 360 degree view of the beautiful Leh mountains. The only downside is there are no ceiling fans and during summer if you open the windows you will have flies and mosquitos. Hence the 4 stars.",Padirajan,/Profile/Padirajan,"Sugar Land, Texas",40

A detailed review of various areas is as follows:  1.	Location: before visiting Leh, when we were doing our research, we found many hotels in the city. However, we chose to stay a little bit away from the city and hence found Ratna Hotel.

About 100 m from Indus river and half a km from main road, regular bus service to Leh and Shey/Thiksey. Food was amazing, probably because of lower occupancy we had advantage of choosing dishes and were served freshly cooked dishes. We had  breakfast and dinner three times- decent variety. Dinner included soup, salads, 2 veg mains, one dal, roti /rice and dessert. The owners Tashi and Erica were great hosts.

In terms of costing it’s pretty much reasonable if you are looking at mid or high level ranges of hotels in Leh – Ladakh.  Pro:   1.	Rooms are very spacious & the view from the rooms or hotel is amazing. 2.
