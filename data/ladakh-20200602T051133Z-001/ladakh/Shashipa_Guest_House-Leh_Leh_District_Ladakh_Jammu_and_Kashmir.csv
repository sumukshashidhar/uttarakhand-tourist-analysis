ladakh,This place is run by an old couple supported by their kids. Rooms are maintained clean. Bathroom has geyser hence we got 24hrs of hot water. Hot water to drink was given to us in a flask at all times. Home cooked breakfast provided with hot cup of tea/ coffee.We were taken care like we were a part of their family. While the guesthouse provides wifi we couldnt avail it as at that time BSNL internet services had been cut by the govt in that region.,Deepa H,/Profile/Deeps2205,"Bengaluru, India",50
