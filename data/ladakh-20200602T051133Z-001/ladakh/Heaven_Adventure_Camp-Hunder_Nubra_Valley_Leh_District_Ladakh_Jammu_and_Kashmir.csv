ladakh,I had a ghastly experience of staying over here as the attendant over here didn't know the proper way to treat a guest. They even don't know how to talk with family or ladies. The total staff is of Nepal even the manager is verbally rough than how can be the staff better.,Meet H,/Profile/648meeth,,10
ladakh,Staff over there was uneducated and were using rough and harsh languages. Make us feel like staying with gangsters. Never make this camp selected when you are with family. There were many insects and very poor cleanliness.,Milan M,/Profile/MilanM1234,,10
ladakh,"Not sure why people get 4 start experience here and how. But I share my experience  This place is full of non-professional and stupid fellows. They don't know how to talk to customer and how to provide quality service  Bunch of Nepally guys run the show and they don't know how to do it properly  Also I have experience reservation issues all around and those folks don't know how to treat family or women.   Rude language, poor quality of tent (this is not hotel but tents) and terrible customer service   I wouldn't recommend anyone to go there while u get far far better other options there",Jaimin P,/Profile/JaiminP_13,,10

ladakh,"Stayed there for 2 days in summer ,it was raw experience ,it was a tent and a clam atmosphere. Take care of sunburns and cold and dry winds. You can always enjoy the stream water like me for drinking but my friends preferred for bottled waters. later come  to know that everyone is using that water only .",Amit l,/Profile/Amitl306,"Pune, India",50

We came here at 4:30 in the evening, warmly Received by camp manager, they offered us evening tea and snacks, then we went to ""Sand dunes"" Most attracted place in this valley, we came back here at 7:30 eve. then we had good homely food here. As we have taken package all are included. It is a well managed swiss camp, having all basic required facilities. They also have Small garden in between camps where the grow vegetables, so you can experience local fruit and vegetables.",Hemant S,/Profile/28hemants,"Jabalpur, India",40
ladakh,"We stayed at Heaven Adventure Camp in Aug through Roads Less Traveled. It is a quiet and peaceful camp with so much to explore in their camp grounds. They grow a lot of vegetables and fruits so we had a good time picking apricots. Our breakfast and dinner was also made with the produce fresh off the farm and it was absolutely delicious. The staff were very friendly and provided tea/coffee, hot water whenever needed. The rooms were clean and tidy. It suffices for a night so we had no problem with the rooms. The families that live and manage the camp are also very friendly and even offered us Ladakhi tea while we played with their kids. Overall I would definitely recommend this place.",sierdso,/Profile/sierdso,"Hyderabad, India",50
ladakh,"Was there in Nubra last week and stayed for a night at Heaven Adventure camp. Though the place was okay and food was good, the tent sucks. The toilet was stinking, bed was not tidy, the tent wasn't cleaned properly.   The staff is courteous, nut not great. Given a choice, one should opt out of this place and look for a different camp. There are tons of camps available nearby.",743naveenr,/Profile/743naveenr,"Bengaluru, India",20
