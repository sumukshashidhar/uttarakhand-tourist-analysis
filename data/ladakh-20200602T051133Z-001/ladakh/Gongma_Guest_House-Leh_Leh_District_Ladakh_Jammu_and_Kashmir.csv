ladakh,"We stayed on 2 occasions. at this excellent budget Guest house.  We settled in and felt at home. Beds are hard but that is normal for India. Bathroom was spotless clean. WiFi is dreadful but that is normal up this end of the world.  Jimmy who manages the Guest House is incredibly helpful. He can organise transport, tours, other accommodation and anything else. Location is but a short walk to the main square. If you the sun the rooms on the right are the best. If you like less sun and the mountains, choose  the left side",sscdjo,/Profile/sscdjo,"Sydney, Australia",50
ladakh,I had an incredible 3 night stay at Gongma Guest House with a group of young adults from the USA. The family was welcoming and gracious. We were able to organize virtually all of our activities with ease through the staff and they were constantly checking in to ensure we had a comfortable stay. The rooms are basic but quite clean and there is hot water for showers. We enjoyed ordering breakfast each morning in the dining room before heading out for the day. I would recommend Gongma to any of my friends or family!,Exploration14720,/Profile/Exploration14720,"Doylestown, PA",50
ladakh,"I stayed at Gongma House with a group of eight from the States, and we left feeling that we had been adopted by a Ladakhi family. Before we arrived, we contacted the host, Morup, and he arranged a car from the airport for us and customized day trips for every day we were there. When we arrived, we were greeted with welcome lemon ginger honey tea (a local specialty), breakfast, and the kindest hosts imaginable. The rooms are simple, but very clean, have great shower pressure, and hot water. It is centrally located in Leh, and very walk-able to shops and restaurants. Stay here!",Zander S,/Profile/zanders2017,,50
ladakh,"It's a family house with nice and spacious rooms. The view is better from the top floor balcony and if you can take the corner rooms, the view is better. The steps to the second floor is a little steep though so take it easy especially considering the altitude of Leh. Food takes time so order well in time.",dhitishman,/Profile/dhitishman,"Wellington, India",40
ladakh,I have stayed in many hotels/guest houses all over India but honestly Gongma Guesthouse takes the cake! And I was lucky too as i didnt choose this place rather we booked through an agent but oh boy we are so thankful to have met the wonderful people who run the hotel.  The package came with breakfast and dinner and the food is lovely with a home-cook feel.  The room was comfortable with adequate heating and hot water. No complains.  Wifi is available but do expect for no connectivity especially during winter season.  5 minutes from the market is such a convenience!   But the best part of this place has to be the couple who runs this guesthouse. They feel like a second parent to me. I love them so much and miss them a lot!  Definitely a must-go!,Ahmad Bukhari R,/Profile/ahmadbukharir,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",50

ladakh,"Leh is a busy place in peak season and finding a place to stay in a budget is tough. During my last visit, I stayed about 4 nights at the Gongma guest house. The place is family run and the hosts are very welcoming. It is relatively small (just about 8-10 rooms). The location is very good. The main market is barely 5 minutes walk.   Aunty makes excellent omelettes and tea for breakfast. Try the Kashmiri rajma with rice for dinner - it tastes heavenly.",shouches,/Profile/shouches,"Pune, India",40
ladakh,"Great interior, hygienic, friendly owner, just near by the market, reasonable prices.. We stayed there for 4 days in the month of July and I'll definitely stay at the same place if I visit again. They also adjusted our luggage for a day as we had to visit Nubra and they didn't charge anything for it. PS. I personally love their curtains.",Bhavuk T,/Profile/bhavukt,,50

ladakh,"We checked into Gongma guest house on the 8th of June. First impressions was a tiny litle guest house and we were wary of the amenities promised and the quality of service. We met our first hots Murup uncle, the owner of the guest houe and Ahmed, his helper who blew our minds away with their hospitality. They created a great first impression about the Ladakhi people, and the people, the place never disappointed. The guest has everything as promised.. 24 hours hot water supply, clean and hygienic rooms, service that few star hotels can fofer, and a lottt of warm smiles.   The hosts were kind enough to give us food at odd hours on sudden request. The Ladakhi people have a special place in my heart, and it all began here!The location is on old chullung road, so easy way in and out",Surya Kiran,/Profile/Surya1313,"Visakhapatnam, India",50
