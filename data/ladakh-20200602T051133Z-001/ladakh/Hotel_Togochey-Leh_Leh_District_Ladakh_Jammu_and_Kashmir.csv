ladakh,"i have traveled across 6 countries and i must say this was my best stay of my life. It was comfortable at the highest i can ever experience (not over-exaggerating)  but it was even better than my own home. Everyone made sure that we had a smile on our face all day. I big thank you and best wishes to the hotel staff but also a special mentioned to the owner, to the chef who made us amazing food (the world loose weight after going to leh but instead we again weight) and last but definitely the most important and sweetest person Amit he was a gem of a person and made this adventure trip a comfortable one.",Rachita Gaglani,/Profile/rachitagagalani,,50
ladakh,The journey to Nubra Valley through Khardungla pass is simply breathtaking. The sand dunes of Nubra valley offers a desert like experience to tourists. You can also see a wide spread of colourful flowers during summers and autumn. The best part is the two humped Camel ride which is quite famous the tourists,AnujaMangle,/Profile/AnujaMangle,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"I was recommended this hotel by my travel agent for my stay in Leh. The staff of Hotel Togochey exceeded all my expectations. The food was just amazing with different flavours in every dish we ordered. I would recommend the owner of this hotel to never let go of the amazing chef that they have.   Special shout out to Amit for his exemplary service. He did not say NO to anything that we asked, even if it required extra effort.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody going to Leh.

ladakh,"Stayed there with family in June for 4 days. Hotel rooms are spacious and comfortable. Number of food items in breakfast and dinner were ok and food was tasty. Team members starting from GM Mr. Azhar and other staff Amit,Raghav,Raveena.Pema,Sonu and Santosh were very cooperative and always ready to serve with smile. Receptionist Mr. Phunsukh need to improve a lot. Wi-fi facility is available only at reception, that too very slow network. Main market is 10-15 min walkable distance and can have a good view of the leh palace and mountains from the front room balconies.  ",Sameer Agrawal,/Profile/Sameer4269,"New Delhi, India",40
