ladakh,First of all you should know that there is electricity in Hundar only for 3.5 hours a day - from 19:30 to 23:00. We found out only when we got there. It wasn't a problem for us since we traveled during the day. The guesthouse was nice and clean. Staff was nice and helpful. The only problem was that there was no hot water even though it was promised to us before we checked in. We stayed for 2 night and it was the case in both nights. We were offered hot buckets instead. In total the place is nice and we will recommend it to anyone that don't mind bucket showers.  ,NY603,/Profile/NY603,,30

ladakh,"We, a group of 5, stayed at Goba guesthouse at Hunder village for one night in July 2016. It was a really great stay. The room was clean, and bathroom was also clean. We had a nice and really vast room. The room also came with Ladahki-style dinner and breakfast which were very amazing. They serve very good food and very good amount of it. The garden is also nice and beautiful. The staff and owners were also very helpful and welcoming with warm hospitality. All of these came with reasonable prices. We were so impressed and love the place in the peaceful Hunder village of Nubra Valley.",DokBua,/Profile/DokBua,"Bangkok, Thailand",50
ladakh,"A wonderful and budget accommodation in the amazing oasis of Hunder. Clean rooms, homely stay and great food. The silence around seems serene with the only sound being that of the flowing stream nearby. Rooms on the first floor provide good scenic view of the surrounding mountains and valleys. Worth a stay.",Anshuman469,/Profile/Anshuman469,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
ladakh,The rooms are good and clean and the view from our rooms is very good. Like this place and stayed there during my recent visit to Nubra Valley on May 2016. We stayed there for one night and able to eat home cook Ladakhi bread in the morning.,Konwar,/Profile/Konwar,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,We stayed at this place for one night in May 2015. It is located on one of the streets of Hunder where there are a lot of guest houses. The rooms are spacious and clean. Thus place is one of the oldest in Hunder and is going for expansion. The bed linen and blankets are not that clean as they seem quite old. ,bansal0408,/Profile/bansal0408,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",30

ladakh,"We a three people and stayed at Goba for a night.  When we reached, all the rooms were full, except one, which the owner hesitatingly showed us as he feared we would not like. But, on the contrary, the room was decent enough. It did not have an attached bathroom, but we were told to use a bathroom just besides the room, which was meant exclusivly for us. So just imagine, if their worst room was this good, how will be their other rooms? And econimical too. (We were charged only Rs 200 per bed)  The food was very good with a homely taste. The owners are one of the most genuine and caring people I have come across. And to our surprise, they have a small collection of magazines, which you can read in free time. This was a bonus.",jj1511,/Profile/jj1511,"Pune, India",50
ladakh,"We stayed in this guest house on 14th Sep 2012. Owner and his wife are very cooperative. The room arrangement is great, with hot water facility in the morning hours. The entire guest house is very well maintained, and clean. Charges are nominal (we paid Rs 600 for a room, and Rs 150 for lunch n dinner respectively). Though there are limited choices for food. The major problem was that food is not served in the room, so it becomes little difficult to eat in the garden in cold temperature. Otherwise a memorable experience. And a great value for money.",SushmitaChiranjeeb,/Profile/SushmitaChiranjeeb,"Chennai, India",40

ladakh,My Leh hotel owner booked this hotel for me & my family during our visit to Nubra valley. I found this hotel to be great value for money. One of the rooms was almost completely covered with wood.. rooms were clean & smelled of newly crafted furnitures.. Dinner was ok but having dinner under an apple tree was a wonderful experience.. Highly recommended!,cashish11,/Profile/cashish11,"Foster City, California",40
ladakh,"I stayed in this guest house during my visit to Nubra Valley in September 2011. This is a nice place, and the owner is a friendly man. He also gave us lots of Apples and Apricots from the orchard when we checked out.   However, the food options are very limited. Egg is the only non-veg option available. Cannot depend on the Electric supply in this region, so the whole area plunges into darkness after sunset. Be sure to carry your iPod.",guhatirtha,/Profile/guhatirtha,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"I was in Nubra valley with my family during the first week of October 2011. Since it was already off season, there were not many choices in terms of places to stay. We reached Hunder bu 3:30 or so from Leh and after trying one guest house who offered us acc only for one night (we were planning to stay for 2 nights), we finally reached the place. The place was being run by a Ladakhi couple and the lady was very kind and sweet. There was a new annexure building that they had built recently and we like a room in that place. Since all working hands from the place had already left because of season end, the couple told us upfront honestly that they will not be able to make elaborate arrangements in terms of food and also told us that they will supply us with hit water in buckets in",rumasan,/Profile/rumasan,"Secunderabad, India",40
