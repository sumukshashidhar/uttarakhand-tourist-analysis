ladakh,"Milarepa Guest House is located in a quiet residential area away from the noisy main road.  Nice view overlooking the mountain from the room.  Walking distance to town.  Nice Ladakhi building with warm decorated dinning room.  Staffs and management are friendly and caring.  We had good experience staying for over a week, Vegetables are freshly picked from garden, yummy breakfast and dinner freshly cooked daily.  Price is good which is value for money, will definitely return and stay again in future. ",Myra L,/Profile/154myral,"Hong Kong, China",50

ladakh,"A quiet couple of the upper-cut of Leh society have sure set up Milarepa Guest House as a Service to the quiet-loving, gentle and committed guests of Leh. A beautiful frontage of vegetable and garden patch, a surrounding of local folk, and a stunning view of the Stok Range with Stok Kangri and lanes running up and down to take you further up towards the Shanti Stupa or right down into the Market. The meals are a simple and wholesome preparation under the direct instructions of the Lady of the House.  Look no further if you wish a real experience of care in Leh. It is better than a star rated hotel, lovelier than an artificial resort and calmer than the advertised quiet.",Vaijayanti Khare,/Profile/VKhare10,"Ladakh, India",50
ladakh,"A great family atmosphere with very kind and down to earth folk. Situated up the hill, the guest house is away enough from the main tourist center for the quiet and calm necessary to enjoy the bold silence of the surrounding mountains. It's just a five minute walk to the eastern most monastery on the hill, opposite Shanti Stupa to the west. The cooking is excellent, the water is hot, and the price is right!",Michael82915,/Profile/Michael82915,"Leh, India",50
