ladakh,"The only downside of this hotel is the location as there's a very narrow winding lane that is rocky and not well maintained / repaired. You will need guided help to reach maybe if you're going first time. If driver doesn't know you need to call hotel. Property looks brilliant in pics, maintenance is ok. We were greeted very cordially by staff with Kahwa Tea and traditional scarf. Staff is very freindly and helpful and they had managed a very good tour for entire Ladakh for us back in July'19. We booked directly with hotel. For overnight trip to Nubra, Pangong, Tso Moriri they helped us keep our main luggage in their luggage room safely. Meals are very good, always take in MAP plan with this hotel because it's difficult to go out to eat during dinner if you don't have bike. Even",AishWDG,/Profile/AishWDG,,30

OYO offer same room in 1000-1300 INR which this hotel charge 3200-4500 INR.  Hotel Staff are Cheater, they will charge you for meals which you never had in their  hotel. Their buffet is very expensive with 450 per meal with only 3-4 basic vegetables. If you go with family ( 4 person) then dinner will const you 1800 INR whereas in 1000-1200 you can have best meal in nearby restaurant that too of you choice.

We relied on the services of hotel for arranging all our transportation to various monasteries, Nubra Valley, Khardung La, Chang la , Pangong Lake, Kargil etc. The hotel also arranged for all the required permits (we changed our plan at the last moment to go to Kargil instead of Tso Moriri lake – the hotel was so quick in arranging the new permit that there was no glitch in our entire trip ).

ladakh,I booked to stay for one night at Nalanda and ended up staying there for five nights instead.  I am giving the hotel a five star rating because the management team went above and beyond in many ways to make us happy. They were helpful in helping us make our itinerary and secure permits and were very fair and reasonable when it came to pricing.  Location is very good and it only takes about 5 minutes to reach most places in Leh. Hotel is also tucked into a pretty quiet and scenic corner.  I see some negative reviews regarding the value for the money but that's because all hotels in Leh are very overpriced on booking and other websites. I highly recommend contacting hotels directly to get a fair price. The fact that Nalanda accommodated me in this area made me quite satisfied. ,Bruno,/Profile/bruno05123,"Hwaseong, South Korea",50

The hotel selected was Nalanda based on some research and experiences shared by travellers on Trip Advisor. I had contacted the hotel directly and was in direct touch with owner of the property Mr Tashi who I can surely tell you is an amazing person to be around He helped me plan my entire trip and suggested what would be best for the duration I stayed.

ladakh,"Located just 10minutes walk from the main market I would consider hotel Nalanda as one of the good hotels in Leh. Overlooking snow capped mountains and Shanti Stupa, it offers a quiet and pleasant stay there. Hotel staff , manager , owner all were really very good, smiling and helpful. They even arranged a bonfire for us on the last night... The stay in Hotel Nalanda was another nice thing of our trip to Leh. Spacious and neat rooms with all rooms facing the garden, simple and tasty food , good dining , I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel as one of the most value for money hotels",Sapnachordia,/Profile/Sapnachordia,"New Delhi, India",40

ladakh,We went to Leh in may'13 to this hotel through make my trip. Initially apprehensive our doubts were cleared the moment we entered the place. Its welcoming and spacious. Away from the main street it provides the peace one looks for on a vacation. Surrounded by small farms and great views to mountains and several monuments the stay for us has been refreshing. The rooms are large and clean.  Nice place to anchor while in Leh. Ideal distance from market and main street.,SwagataSN,/Profile/SwagataSN,"Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India",40
ladakh,I stayed at hotel nalanda ladakh from 28 Sept to 8 Oct 2012. To begin with the hotel is located at in an ideal place for people who like to stay away from the crowd and like solitude. Located at Karzoo which is abt 15 mins walking distance from main Leh market it is sorrounded by majestic mountains on all sides with excellent view of the Shanti Stupa. Staff is very helpfull and co-operative. I would especially like to thank their maanger Mr. Norbu who was always ready to help his guests with a smile. Despite Ladakh having a perenial power problem there was no power shortage in the hotel as they switched on the generator whenever there was no power. Another big plus was the availibility of hot water for 24 hrs. Food was simple and taste was fantastic. Overall it was a very good,cooldude67,/Profile/cooldude67,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"This hotel seems also to be called the Leh View which is confusing. It is however a good base for exploring Leh and the Ladakhi region, which is what I used it for. It is set on the north west edge of Leh no more than a 15 minutes stroll from the centre. In truth it is a modest establishment, but its bedrooms are fair sized, clean and most have balconies with great views to a gompa high on a crag. The bathrooms are large and functional. Ladakhi building standards are a little rough though. The staff are very friendly and obliging. The restaurant is stark but the food relatively reasonable. Bear in mind that Leh is a remote location and that your expectations should not be high. Leh is prone to extensive power cuts.",skehan,/Profile/skehan,"London, United Kingdom",40

We faced some problem due to lack of availability of electricity but that was the problem in the whole city. The hotel cannot be blamed.

ladakh,"We stayed for about 6 days with two treks in between in hotel Nalanda ( called hotel Leh then) in July/aug 2012 We were part of a personal group of 9 people occupying 5 rooms. The hotel had wonderful rooms and common area. The staff could not do enough for you, especially Manoj who did not know how to say ""no"". In fact when he had been serving us with all our individual wants and taking real good care of us with the ever present smile, one of our group askd him ""Manoj do you ever say no"" and that was the only time he said ""no"" :)   The hotel is clean, and very tastefully decorated common areas for relaxing when you are acclimatising. The food ( we ate vegetarian) was always excellent. We had dinner there most days, and it was indian, chinese ( the indianised version) and some",nomadiccouple,/Profile/nomadiccouple,Melbourne,50

The rooms are spacious with a large bath room .The rear corridor and front balcony provide a breath taking views of Japanese Peace Pagoda (Shanti Sthupa ) on one side and the Tsemo Gompa on the other side two iconic monuments of Leh.  The surroundings around the hotel are green trees and mountains , away from the hustle of sounds yet quite near the market place by walk. The owner and his wife maintain a beautiful flower garden in the open lawn space which has a huge circular umbrella with seating arrangement in the open.

The view of magnificent Himalaya, Indus, the picturesque Nubra valley, friendly people there, the view of Pangong and Tso Moriri, the monasteries, the beautiful sky - everything was superb; cannot be expressed in words. It is a life time experience. One has to see it by himself/herself - no photography can reveal the hidden beauty. The stay at Hotel Leh View- now Hotel Nalanda Ladakh was very pleasant. It is a home away from home. We still fondly remember the smiling faces of all the staff.  Jullei",Kangkan,/Profile/Kangkan,"Tezpur, India",40

Reaching it is really easy as many boards show the road to it from Main Bazaar street (still written as former name 'Hotel Leh View'). Once there, it offers a peaceful place with nice view over Leh.

I will never forget the first meeting with Hotel Nalanda Ladakh in Leh. We were kindly welcomed and the hotel staff offered us tea. From the very beginning the kindness, hospitality, and personal approach was heartwarming. The hotel employees are well service-oriented and are always busy to create a nice and relaxed ambience.   The hotel is situated on the outskirts of Leh in Leh-Karzoo in a quiet and peaceful countryside.   The rooms are cozy and spacious, and there are many windows allowing plenty of light inside. Through the windows faced to the east the Shanti Stupa up an hill can be seen. Through the windows faced to the west the Namgyal Tsemo Gompa",Henk M,/Profile/HenkM426,"Nijmegen, The Netherlands",40

Lovely quite surroundings with green fields all around and walk able from main bazaar street. The staff is very friendly and I ate the best veg sandwiches over there. They were sweet to make them for us when we reached at odd times from our outings; too late for lunch and too early for dinner! They were planning to have a wi-fi when we were there so by now it would be fully functional. The garden has beautiful flowers worth praising. In all a very warm and comfortable stay.
