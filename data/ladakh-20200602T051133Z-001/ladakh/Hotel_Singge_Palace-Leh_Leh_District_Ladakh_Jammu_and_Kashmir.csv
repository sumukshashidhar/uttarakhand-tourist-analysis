ladakh,"Hi, We stayed at Hotel Singge Palace from 7th - 9th September 2019. Below are my views -  Good experience -  1. The location of the hotel is good. It is at 5-7 minutes walk from the main market.  2. We booked rooms in the new wing which is better.  Bad experience -  1. They have put soft mattress which is not comfortable.   2. Mr. Arjun has pure money making mindset with no integrity. We got taxis booked through the hotel and they only arranged the required permits. When asked to share cost of permit, he said it is INR 3k for 4 people. To this my husband politely said it should be around INR 1600 as that is what is mentioned on internet. Mr. Arjun got offended and asked us to arrange taxi from outside. The point is we as customers have right to ask for receipt of any expense for",Vibs2014,/Profile/Vibs2014,"Bengaluru, India",30
ladakh,"From East to North. From 31 degree to 13 degree. From sea level to high altitude. Yet the moment we entered Hotel Singge Palace we felt at home. Nice ambience, comfortable accommodation and yummy food. I want to thank all from Reservation Manager Desh Raj Mehta to all smiling and caring people of the reception, of the restaurant and of house keeping. Nice location, near the airport. Shanti Stupa can be seen from the hotel itself and it looks splendid at night. Ladakh is no doubt a tough trip. But the moment we would come back to the hotel after finishing a tough trip we would feel as if we came back home and would be fully refreshed to begin next day's journey. Only one request to the management to reduce the price of food. Very tasty but very expensive.",Bipasha N,/Profile/rimanee,,40
ladakh,"I went to Ladakh with my family and parents and stayed at this hotel. The entire booking was done by Mr Vikas from NCR and he seamlessly managed the entire booking process. the hotel manager, Mr Arjun is a gem of a person. He did not miss any opportunity to make our stay memorable. All the staffs including the people from the restaurant, porters, housekeeping, receptions, I can't think of a single glitch with anyone. Our transport was also arranged by the hotel. The drivers, Maqbool Hussain and Hymayun Khan are possibly the best persons I have met in Leh. Having spent 8/9 days together, we are good friends now. Highly recommended hotel. Very close to the town centre. And Ladakh is a must visit place.",bardhan_ani,/Profile/bardhan_ani,"London, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"Perfectly located very close to the main bazaar, this hotel is a gem. We had them booked for 3 nights, 2 nights together and then another one last before exiting Leh. The hotel is just 5 minutes away from the main bazaar, where you would easily get all the souvenirs, dry fruits, pashmina, etc. They upgraded us in the last night which made the stay more pleasant. The rooms are equipped very well based on the rooms, they have direct dish connections, toilets are very neatly maintained and are fully functional. I would definitely recommend this for any visitors and would definitely return when I come back to Leh",umair9001,/Profile/umair9001,"Doha, Qatar",50
ladakh,"The hotel is situated at a walking distance from the main market. The rooms are very good and clean. The food is amazing - both the breakfast and dinner were very good. Though a small problem is that they are sometimes a little inconsistent in making food of same taste on a repeat order. The staff is very polite and very helpful. House keeping and room service is quick and efficient.  The only hiccup was the bed. If you are accustomed to sleeping on a hard mattress, then you will find it hard to sleep on the very springy mattresses here. But once we requested the staff for changing the mattress, they immediately acted on it and changed all to hard mattresses in all our 4 rooms at once (obviously this is subject to availability of hard mattresses at the time).",Piyush Goyal,/Profile/727piyushg,"Bathinda, India",40

ladakh,This is a fairly large hotel. The best thing about the hotel is its location. Less than 5 minutes walk from Leh market. The main building of the hotel which houses the premium room and the restaurant looks in good shape. The restaurant and the food was good. Very good variety is on offer at the buffet breakfast. The staff has a helpful attitude. My son had fever and had lot of sweating after taking paracetamol. The housekeeping staff arranged to change the bedding at night.  We checked in on 2 occasions and stayed in Super Deluxe rooms. The Super Deluxe room wing is separated from the main wing and seems to be older than the main wing. The super deluxe rooms are spacious but old and tired. It appears that their good days are past them and they badly need major renovations. There,MRahul,/Profile/MRahul,"Singapore, Singapore",40

He was the one to arrange an equally helpful cab driver who guided us through out the hospital formalities and also went out at night to get medicines for us as we had no clue about the place.The driver was with us till he dropped us back to the hotel late night.

The staff are very friendly and helpful.  2. Central location - the main market is a 2-minute walk. 3. Good restaurant - breakfast buffet is excellent. Dinner buffet is repetitive and gets boring after one night. Ala-carte is expensive - a banana (unlimited and included with breakfast) is charged Rs. 75 at lunch.  The Cons: 1. Terrible Wi-Fi. Multiple customers had the same problem. You have to go through a complicated setup process, very different from most hotels where you just enter the username and password to login.

Restaurant serves great food & they are always ready to go out of way to give you a most delightful experience.  Hotel is very close to main market & hence it adds more value to property as it allows you to explore local market in evening.

We had to downgrade to find something suitable.  At this point the manager intervened and all the staff were extremely helpful at all times in trying to sort out our complaints.  We checked out the next day for our onward trip to Nubra Valley.  Returned to the hotel the following day and this time everything worked out great. The room was as expected and we had no complaints.  Breakfast and dinner was delicious at all times although limited in choice but still adequate.

The trek is done in winter months of jan and mid feb so the temp was b/w -15 to -25 and the company organising our trek gave us a very shady hotel so 8 of us planned to move to a better place. In winter very few hotels operate in Leh due to low tourist movement , so after a lot of searching we came across this place. It was a life saver. The place is absolutely amazing, its very clean with the best of facilities that we never expected after what was offered to us by our trek planner.

The service is very friendly and courteous. Any needs were taken care of immediately. The WiFi crashed for our first two days, but I think it was a regional network not hotel issue.

ladakh,Singge Palace unarguably has one of the best locations in Leh. You are pretty much in the market and walk anywhere you wish to - you must choose a hotel which allows this luxury anyway when you are in Leh as there is no convenient local transport like that in metros. Evenings turned out to be very enjoyable courtesy this facility.  The sitout area is very charming where there maybe a cultural show if you are lucky. There is also a well maintained coffee room and games room. To me the best experience was with the dining area staff who go out of their way to make your meals enjoyable whether through customisation of the food or through conversations.

The Hotel is close to the Market, but still  away from the hassle. Good view from rooms, super clean facilities, standard amenities and real warm hospitality. The special mention is the simple , tasty and healthy food. Amazingly they served excellent Veg and Non veg food and Soups are great in the cold nights. Leh is not a very common tourist place and managing a property is not an easy task. The hotel management has done a real good job...the flowers, the small lawn and smiling faces of all the staffs are always welcome sight.

Overall the look & feel of this place is good, USPs being : a. central courtyard where one can relax with family and even have a nice breakfast. We were fortunate to stay in (supposedly) the best room (119) wich is the only one with an adjoining balcony, complete privacy (almost at dead end of 1st floor) and windows which serve as sitting area & has excellent cross ventilation b. Friendly dining room staff (esp. Ramu & Jeevan) who offer very personalised services (great help if accompanied with kids) -of course,a regular tipping off of 50-100 bucks really works!! c.

On the first two days of my stay in Leh, when I had been told to take it easy, I could still walk  up to the German Bakery and see some shops.  If I had to think of one flaw, it would be the food -- while it was not bad, it paled in comparison with the fantastic thukpa, momos and bakery products one could get outside. The service however, made up for it -- the waiters would look quite desolate whenever I said I won't be",geetanjali,/Profile/geetanjali,New Delhi,50
