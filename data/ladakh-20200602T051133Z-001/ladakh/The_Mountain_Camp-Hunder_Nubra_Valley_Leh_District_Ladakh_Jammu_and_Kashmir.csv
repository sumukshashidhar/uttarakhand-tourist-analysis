ladakh,"The Camp was very good and equally supported by Mr. Abdul and his very co-operative team. They provided good comfort at best prices. The overall hospitality was very good additionally they also provided us very good tips for our next stay at Pongyong Tso lake.

ladakh,"We scouted this camp for accomodation. First warning, no other campers in peak season. Its 20,000r which is pricey. It was like a ghost town in July and there was barbed wire everywhere.  Guys who run it nice and river is lovely by the campsite. Stay with a local family in Thiksey instead for 700 R including meals, this is how you discover the REAL india. I dont know who owns these glamping tents but they are popping up like muhrooms are overpriced and not owned by Indians.",Emily M,/Profile/128emilym,"Ubud, Indonesia",20
ladakh,The camp is located near to the mountain. No other camp will give you better view than this one. The hotel owner is really humble and will take care of all your needs. The staff is courteous and humble. They gave us camp fire and it was amazing. Thanks Abdul bhai and staff for amazing service.,Ashish_Choure,/Profile/Ashish_Choure,"Thane, India",50

ladakh,Really an oasis in cold desert. When I traveled to nubra I thought the stay is going to horrible but when I reached I find everything is perfect. Nice place with most picturesque view.   Except the dining area there is no concrete structure. You have to stay in tents but the tents are good. Food is perfect. The management deserves big thumbs up for serving such delicious food in such a remote place. Stuffs are helpful . The manager provides excellent travel advice. I enjoyed every bit of my stay. One let down in the morning I got only hot water making it impossible to take a bath.  My opinion you have no other option but to stay.:-),subhankarnag,/Profile/subhankarnag,"Kolkata, India",40
