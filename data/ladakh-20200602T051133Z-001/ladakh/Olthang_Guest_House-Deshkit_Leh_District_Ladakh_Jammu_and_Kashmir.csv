ladakh,"A decent establishment in Nubra Valley. The hotel had comfortable rooms, good food, and cheerful staff. It also has an inviting garden, and some rooms look out towards the valley. Popular with large groups, but you can always request to be put up in a separate block.",prayashgiria,/Profile/prayashgiria,"New Delhi, India",40

ladakh,"The Hotel Olthang in Diskit in the Nubra Valley was as good as ever in such a remote location. I wanted to write a review 3 years ago when I first stayed there. Narendra the hotel manager is such a lovely character, always helpful and funny. He really makes a difference.  The new rooms are a little more pricey but it's worth it. Plus the season is very short as the only access is via the highest pass in the world. The kitchen delivered some simple and tasty meals made mostly of local products. The guys will bring a bucket of hot water for your shower which felt so good after a day riding a bike from Leh via the famous Khardung La. Considering what's involved in getting there I suspect most people wouldn't bother unless they have a keen interest in Gompas. It's far easier to make",lucsky,/Profile/lucsky,"Ham Tien, Vietnam",30
ladakh,"The hotel provides good, clean resting place with good food. The maharashtrians will find Aapala Manus at this hotel -Narendra from Pune who cooks great food. Hotel has a decent garden & staff is very courteous.",milindR1258,/Profile/milindR1258,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,The hotel was clean and ok for what you can expect in such a remote part of the world. Electricity had to be generated with a noisy generator and the hot water for the shower was provided only for certain times of the day. But all of this was done on request for the convenience of the guests.  The food was absolutely delicious. Since the nights were cold we asked for hot water bottles which we received emediately. The service was very friendly.,mlf64,/Profile/mlf64,"Bern, Switzerland",30

ladakh,"A very small guest house with no other guests besides us. We went there in nearly closing time as hotels around Diskit are closed by mid october. The hotel had no other guests besides us but the staff was courteous and helpful. With no electricity and issues with Diesel for genset, lights work only at nights. Still the staff helped us with hot water on demand and made us a nice simple dinner with fresh produce from the vicinity. Overall a nice stop for",thisisankit,/Profile/thisisankit,"Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,Jhuely in Ladakhi means Welcome.....Had a real welcoming and pleasant stay at Olthang guest house. Was pretty tired with the road travel since we had travelled thru the Khardungla Pass and had a bad headache. The manager and the support staff were really helpful and gave me warm water to drink and also had few bottles of warm water kept in the room. Food was excellent . Also wanted to make a call back home and the manager gave his phone and asked us to make calls.  Indeed they made our stay very comfortable.  We had a room on the first floor and the view too was very nice.,shanteed,/Profile/shanteed,"Thane, India",50
ladakh,"This is a clean, friendly and basic place to stay that is great value. The views of the valley are great. As mentioned, hot water is only available in the mornings and the beds are a little hard. The guest house is very close to the monastery. Worth a visit.",mmm42,,"Brisbane, Australia",40
ladakh,The guest house is very basic. Hot water available only in the morning for couple of hours. Food just about ok. The staff is very good. The lodge has a good view of the monastery and the sitting Buddha.,Bhubonpothik,,"Thane, India",30
ladakh,"We have been over Khardang La a couple of times, opting for the camps further up the valley but the Olthank leaves them all for dead. Nice comfortable if a little basic rooms ensure a good sleep. Food is great and everyone here is keen to please. In my opinion, this is the best place around Dislket to stay by far and it is just a couple of minutes away from the awe inspiring monastary.",gumbyr,,"Helensville, New Zealand",40
