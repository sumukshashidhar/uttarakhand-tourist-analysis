ladakh,"We spent a weekend in Leh, and we had a great time here. The host is a really nice family, that gave us good advices, cooked for us tasty food, and were there when needed. I had a great time here :) As a final note, I would not recommend to book the place via Agoda, because they do not notify the host and also sometimes do not pay them. Book directly with them and you will get a better price and experience!",JuanAlmeyda,/Profile/JuanAlmeyda,,50

Wifi was always there to keep us connected to the world, especially when our mobile phones were not working. (only BSNL, Airtel postpaid work in JnK). We did not have too many expectations like commercial hotels in big cities. But what we received their was much more than that. A hospitality with no commercial touch to it. Hosts is a family who stay in same property with only 2 helpers. But never in 6 days we had to wait long after we requested anything. Food was tasty with veges grown in backyard.

CHUBI SPONBO is a tiny discreet homestay with just 8 rooms and a lovely lovely kitchen garden , outdoor sitting and a cute cozy lounge .  We had an unfortunate accident at Leh, which was the reason of our extension .  Our hosts were a lovely couple who made us feel so much at home that we were disappointed when we had to make our way back to city life .  Their amazing friendly staff made yum home made food and even dried and made my friends hair as she was hurt and could not manage these tasks .

It's a beautiful home set back from the road with a serene and impressive vegetable garden. The house is spotless and well maintained by the lovely hosts, who speak excellent English and went above and beyond to help my wife and I settle in after a long trek. They arranged breakfast and a taxi early in the morning too. Our room was on the first floor, with big windows and views over the garden, wooden floorboards, a clean shower with steady hot water, a lovely clean bed.

ladakh,"We're pleased with the amazing hospitality served by this guys. My friend recommended this guest house and without no doubt we booked this guest house. Tariff was quite economical and guesthouse is located to near leh market. Bike rent shop is next to this guest house where you can hire a bike easily. Service and food offered during our stay was amazing. Apart from it, these guys even help us out with our travel plans in leh during our journey. Room which they've provided was spacious and with large balcony from where you can see shanti Stupa (Local sightseeing of Ladakh). We would prefer this guest house whenever we go to Leh And will recommended to our friend as well. Book this guest house without any doubt in your mind!!!",Rushabhd0shi,/Profile/Rushabhd0shi,"Sydney, Australia",50
ladakh,"A family managed homestay with clean rooms and smiling family. Mr.Sponbo and family stay in the same place in Chubi area of leh on road to khardungla ( general hospital road). I had stayed with him in 2009 and since then there are lot of improvements. Don't go with hotel approach, this is good place to chill out with some home cooked food and cosy stay with clean rooms and toilet. They have a beautiful garden from which pickings are done to cook food. The approach road is small so you might have to carry your luggage but as discussed with Sponbo he will get that sorted out in 1-2 years. A decent glass room overlooking the garden is best place to have all your meals. The market is also at a walkable distance but while coming back it has high gradient. Morning you will get hot",Anand K,/Profile/80anandk,Pune,50
ladakh,"Excellent homestay with gr8 meals & that too at a very reasonable cost. Mr.Sponbo is an amazing person a teacher by profession, hospitality is at its best at this place, i am visiting Leh since 2009, & have always preferred to stay at this place. the second advantage is the most awaited road i.e the road to the height-est  motor-able road to Khardunla pass just passes adjacent to our stay, & the market is just on the feet with hardly walk of 1 to 2 mins. Many restaurants are in the vicinity of the stay.Mr. Sponbo also offers the fresh farm vegetables grown in his garden along with unlimited apples of the tree which is just at the entrance. Don't forget to ask for Break-fast with Ladhaki bread & masala omelet, u have to inform him prior in the evening for the Breat-fast",viresh2015,/Profile/viresh2015,"Pune, India",50
ladakh,"Chubi Sponbo... The name that I would recommend to all my Friends if they would ever visit Leh. It is a compact, economical option. The best part about chubi is the hospitality. The owner and people there are very humble, down to earth. The food was awesome and most of the produce is from their own gardens. Rooms are economical, spacious, clean. People at Chubi SPonbo are very helpful and accomodative. When our plan went for a toss due to ever changing climate in Leh, they were kind enough to accomodate us though the guest house was full and also gave us a room to keep our extra baggage while we were away for couple of days. The location is very close to the market but still away from the busting taxi stand and main roads.

ladakh,"We were 6 bikers staying at the guest house for almost a week, and guess what it just felt like home. Right from the time Wangail Sponbo guided us to his guesthouse until we left, his family took care of us at their place. The place has a nice garden which serves as a good hangout spot when the weather cooperates :). These folks are extremely helpful. I'm not sure if it's just brilliant hospitality or something more. Since the first day we have some errands to run in Leh, he helped us with his car and mobile phone without any hesitation when we asked him. Food we had was good. Ask for the hot soup and Ladakhi roti. If you are going on a budget trip looking for a comfortable place to stay, I would any day recommend this place over other resorts. The place is 5 minutes away from",ajvasudhar,/Profile/ajvasudhar,,50
ladakh,"From the moment we arrived, Chubi Sponbo made us feel right at home.  The owner and everyone who works there are very friendly and extremely helpful. We spent more than 4 days and experienced unsurpassed hospitality.  It is located at the side of the Tsemo Monastery.  You can sit there and enjoy the view of shanti stupa, leh palace and khardung la all day long.  The food was homemade and delicious. The rooms are spacious, clean and the main market is just at 5mins walk. If you are trying to decide where to stay in Leh, I highly recommend Chubi Sponbo for their location, food, hospitality, cleanliness and fantastic service.",PrabhuVarathan,/Profile/PrabhuVarathan,,50

ladakh,"Room ,location and amenities is what the review box is asking me to write about... they are excellent , located at the side of a sacred place,the Tsemo Monastery, and not far from the market, peaceful and clean...delicious food that has fresh organic home grown veggies etc etc. But these are the things that one can put a price on... you could spend some more money and have them elsewhere...in a bigger fancier hotel. What's priceless about this place ... is the people you get to know there and the stories you bring home. Wangyal ji's family is in a word awesome... the kids whose innocent curiosity and brilliance can make you a philosopher, the stories that make you understand history, culture and human values...and the silent interaction with nature while contemplating your own",Sarfaraz,/Profile/singingsufi,"New Delhi, India",50

It is run extremely well, clean and tidy rooms, very beautiful organic garden, sufficient space for two wheeler parking, very very friendly kids, and the owners are very accommodative.   The food served is very tasty, especially the ladakhi bread at breakfast, the soup at dinner time.   Our stay of close to a week was very memorable and there would be no other place we would stay from now on whenever we visit leh. We would cherish the moments spent, and strongly recommend other travelers to check this place out.   ",amit shah,/Profile/ashah1223,"Chennai District, India",50

The rooms are well fitted with latest amenities and are cozy enough to give you a feeling of togetherness.
