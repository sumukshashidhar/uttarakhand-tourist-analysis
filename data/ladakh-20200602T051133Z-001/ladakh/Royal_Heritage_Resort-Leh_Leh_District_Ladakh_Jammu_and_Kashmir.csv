ladakh,"We had very great time of stay at Royal heritage resort in july 2019. Rooms are good, staff was very polite and food was great. The resort have good parking facility, good outdoor space around rooms, very comfortable lobby and great restaurant. The Reception staff, restaurant staff are all very polite and always ready to help. Food served was very good. They have very good buffet for breakfast and dinners.  Located on fort road and is very near by  to mall road and main market. Overall a great experience of stay.",Mohit M,/Profile/Mike-Shimla,"Shimla, India",50
ladakh,"I stayed with my wife & 2 kids (9 years & <2 years) for full week. although the facilities might not be of a great and professional hotel, but I felt it like home there. the staff are really very cooperative. some things are ignored by them like they do not provide water in room (probably mine only), but this is because people in Leh don't drink much of water. But if you ask, they will provide water jugs with glasses. You need to tell them your requirement.  you can understand with the fact that i was with 22 month old baby. they arranged everything for him (like milk etc.) that I asked them. They never minded when my son was creating nuisances etc. the hotel is great for family stay, may not be good enough for a solo stay.  I found it great so rating it as 5 stars.",Shakti,/Profile/Shakti_Leh,,50

ladakh,"I stayed in this property for 4 nights during my visit to Leh Ladakh in July 2018 and I am not very happy with how it turned out. They have to improve immensely on their services and the professionalism of their staff to even quality to be a 2 star property. Here is my experience:  Good: 1. The property has parking space 2. You can walk to the Leh market and is 15 minute drive from Leh airport 3. The hotel has a beautiful garden with fruit trees, flowers and kitchen garden vegetables. 4. The served was simple and I liked their dinner menu. I had breakfast, lunch and dinner at this property. 5. They have their small houses with a drawing room, sofa TV, with one bedroom attached bath and one small room which has one bed. So a 4 member family including the kid can be accommodated",atimoum,/Profile/atimoum,,30

ladakh,The location of the hotel is best. It is around 1.5km from the main market and its just a straight road. The rooms are big and even the toilets are clean and big. However the best part about the hotel is its staff and owner who take personal interest to ensure that your stay in leh is comfortable. I stayed in the hotel as I was running in the Ladhak marathon. The staff was very helpful throughout my stay.,Abhishekduta,/Profile/Abhishekduta,"Bengaluru, India",40

ladakh,"This property is great place to stay. The location and the hospitality is way beyond expectations. Homely feeling, awesome view from the cottages, delicious food and clean premises. As far as the facilities are concerned, one will get all the necessary ones here (hot water, on demand cuisine, wifi etc). It is very near to the market, taxi stand and bank. To sum it up it was a great experience and would seriously recommend you a stay if you wanna be Leh!",umangparikh2000,/Profile/umangparikh2000,"Pune, India",50
ladakh,Just stay away from this place. The rooms are average at best and the service and attitude of the staff the worst I've ever encountered. We were a riding group on our Ladakh expedition and had to change our stay to a different hotel.,ponnapz,/Profile/ponnapz,"Hyderabad, India",10
ladakh,"Poorest service. Terrible food quality, never on time Lacks in basic amenities. No geysers only solar heating so if the day is not sunny don't expect hot water in winter or summer.  Big lack of staff even staff present is untrained.",dbgarg101,/Profile/dbgarg101,"Kaithal, Haryana, India",10
ladakh,"Location of the resort is near to the market . Exterior of this resort was gud whereas interior was average . We were the first guest of this resort , as it was off season visit.The owner of this hotel was friendly (mr nurbo) and we were satisfied by services of the staff . Quality of food was more than the average . Due to offseason visit the highways were closed (manali-leh) . Hot water was available for 2 hrs in morning and 2 hrs in afternoon . Electricity goes now then . Anyone planning to book this resort book deluxe cottages as they are more spacious , neat . interior is gud .",dharun2015,/Profile/dharun2015,"Ahmedabad, India",30
ladakh,Being an employee of the leading travel portal of India and going by the rating of the hotel I booked this hotel however it's the most unpleasant hotel to go for. The services are a total put off. Even a simple request of drinking water takes them 2 hours and the serving guy behaves most unpleasantly while serving you.  On the day of arrival we asked for 2 buckets of hot water as promised everyday for bath. We were refused hot water on the premise that the guy who checked out 2 hr back used up the hot water and the same can't be provided.  Just answer this will they let us stay on the payment of the checked out guest that they can refuse us the hot water because the checked out guy used it.  It's a complete turn off. Please avoid this hotel.,Shruti2523,/Profile/Shruti2523,"New Delhi, India",10
ladakh,"Location of hotel is near to market and hotel has lot more attractive cottages and garden area.  Exterior of the resort looks pretty whereas interior is normal. Liked the gardening of the resort, they had every kind of plants which attracts visitors.   Resort owner was nice and friendly, he was helping us on all the way till we stayed in the resort.   The days we stayed was non season, still room services were not up to the mark whereas for paid service it's quicker than expected.   Would suggest owner to have a Camera(CCTV) installed in front of the Reception/Entrance to track people moving in and out of Resort, so that if any misplacing can be tracked quickly.",tejkumar h,/Profile/tejkumarh,"Bangkok, Thailand",30
ladakh,Average property with good location. Hotel is located near to market place. Daily need shops are just 10-15 meters from hotel. Staying in a cottage is better option rather than standard rooms. Room furniture is not nice. Wash rooms are basic. Service is kind of poor with very limited staff. Food is just average. Needs bit improvement. Wash rooms & Room furniture needs to be upgaraded. Lobby area looks very shabby. Needs improvement. ,AaarDeee,/Profile/AaarDeee,,30
ladakh,"Hey guys recently we planned our trip to leh and we were looking for hotels and finally pinned down royal heritage resort.. The hotel provides accommodation in cottages and rooms and we selected a room. Both the cottage and room were pretty clean. The resort is near the market so even that is good. But Wat I liked most about the resort was the owner himself , the hospitality provided by him just made our trip a lot easier. There is a personal touch in every thing. I would definitely say it's a home away from home. The food provided by them was very good they have a small garden where in they grow vegetables there itself. Food wise it's excellent.  All in all I would highly recommend this resort. ",Pradeep N,/Profile/120pradeepn,,50
ladakh,"We stayed here for 2 nights in one of the cottages. The place outside the cottages is very nicely done with a lot of flowers and trees. The cottages, beds were clean and the bathroom was tidy. A very beutiful place in all respect. The staff, although short in number and hard to find on the reception, was very cooperative and helpful. One of us was suffering from altitude sickness when we checked into the hotel and the staff did all they could to ensure that our friend recovered well. Breakfast and the dinner served were decent.",ms14_delhi,/Profile/ms14_delhi,"Mumbai, India",50

ladakh,"We were booked on a MakeMyTrip.com (MMT) of Ladakh & Kashmir tour and there were so many people on this tour that some were placed in this hotel and the rest of the group in another hotel.  On first impression, the hotel looks drab from a distance.  We (3 of us) were given a chalet with a lounge, two room (one with a twin bed, cable tv, wardrobe and ensuite, while the other with a single bed).  Wi-Fi signal is available near the reception.  A disappointing aspect of this hotel is that hot water is rationed and available only at certain times in the morning and evenings.  Sometimes we had to contact reception when the hot water is not available at the stipulated time.  The hotel staff are warm, friendly, flexible and accommodating.  The manager, Mr Norboo Joldan was a wealth of",Andy K,/Profile/andyk787,"Perth, Australia",30
ladakh,"Booked this hotel because we got floored by the website. Stayed in the independent bungalows, which are good but the housekeeping needs a big slap on the wrist. Filth in the nooks and crannies of sofas, stained and faded upholstery and half used soap in the bathroom....yuck! The food here is mediocre at best and the hotel seems understaffed for its size. This hotel has great potential, perhaps the management needs a wake up call.",avtaar,/Profile/avtaar,"Mumbai, India",30

People like to eat spicy and modren food and cannot eat same kind of food every day spl when they are on holidays Require bar with good slection of wine and other drinks",Mappy71,/Profile/Mappy71,Delhi,40
ladakh,"This hotel is nice and clean. It is located on the fort road. The rooms have a nice balcony, and have a great view of the mountains. Rooms are clean, but basic.   Service needs lots of improvement. Being in a cold place, you need hot water to bathe in - and that takes plenty of reminders to get working. Rooms do not get cleaned everyday, nor do they replace towels. Complain loudly, if you need service.   Food - quite average, though it did improve a bit after a lot of complaining.   Lower you expectations, if you need to stay in this place ...",Venkatesh V,/Profile/Venky1094,"Bengaluru, India",20
ladakh,wonderfully located near fort in the heart of the city. I came to know of them by net but really i was happy at my search. the owner  the chef and the waiters all were ready to help us. U know it is really very hard to be in leh on the very first day of ur arrival and u feel a lot of sickness. they give u support like reach to hospital if needed. Mint tea and black coffee are thier best offerings. U can seek ur fav dish also..  very reasonably priced also and the best thing is thier internal lawn along with the cottages.,naveenjain,/Profile/naveenjain,jaipur,50

ladakh,Spacious rooms and decent sized bathrooms. The units are in the garden and the owner grows his own veg. The owner was so honest - didn't know the exchnage rate but gave us 5000 rupees and told us to settle with him when we knew the exchange rate. About a 15 min walk from middle of town uphill but nice and quiet. Cable tv in the room. Beds were a bit hard though !,rdella,/Profile/rdella,"Princes Risborough, United Kingdom",50
