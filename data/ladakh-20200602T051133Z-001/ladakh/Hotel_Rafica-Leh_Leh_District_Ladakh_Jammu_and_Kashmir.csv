The hotel staff is very helpful and their service is spot on.  The rooms however are pretty average. They're small and in the absence of fans, it could get suffocating at night. They have provided room heaters and hot water is available in the mornings. Avoid Ground Floor rooms near the entrance as it gets very noisy and there's little privacy.

Over the last several years I have seen this Hotel change aesthetic wise & hospitality wise. With every passing year I get impressed with the vision the owner Mr. Anis Rehman has towards serving his guests.   It indeed is a great place to stay & the location is fabulous as its proximity to the Bazaar is not more than 5 mins on foot which makes it an ideal place to stay when in Leh. The food served is great. The chief chef Amin specialize s in Indian & Italian cuisine. The staff is extremely polite & bend backwards to ensure all the demands of the guest are met.

ladakh,"Good interiors, spacious bathroom & excellent service, this is what I will say if you ask me our overall experience at Rafica. After checking out 2 – 3 other hotels in Leh our driver Alibhai led us to this place whose owner was a friend of his. We were showed two rooms Normal Room (Ground Floor – Rs. 700) & Deluxe room (2 nd Floor – Rs. 1000). After seeing the rooms & hearing the specially discounted price we decided to increase our budget a little & opted for deluxe room. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this place. The rooms are spacious with very good interiors. The wooden interiors keep the room warm even when the outside temperature is chilling. The bathroom is large & enough space is provided for keeping our things & luggage. Hotel staff is courteous & always smiling. We",Nipun S,/Profile/Babunipun,Delhi,40
