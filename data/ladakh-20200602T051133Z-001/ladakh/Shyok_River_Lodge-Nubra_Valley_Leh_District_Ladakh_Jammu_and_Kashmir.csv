ladakh,"During our three week exciting trip through Ladakh, we stayed a couple of nights at Shyok River Lodge.  Our comfortable room had a truly exceptional!! view on Shyok river and mountains  which are connected to the Karakorum range and the barley fields of the village. The guest-rooms are situated on the top-floor of a traditional Ladakhi farm, which is still being used as such. The vegetarian meals, served by local women, belong to the best meals we were offered during our trip.The traditional Tibetan kitchen/dining-room is a cosy place to stay and good meeting place with the other guests. It is not difficult to feel connected to the Shyok-locals and get an insight in local habits and traditional-and ecological farming-methods, which still keep the villagers largely",Klaas en Mieke,/Profile/Meersel-Dreef,,50
ladakh,"The four of us cycled for several weeks through Ladakh. Just astonishing! What a beauty. Together with Jan Knaapen we arranged our trip. Half way we stayed for three days at the Shyok River Lodge....and that was everything we needed at that moment. Jan, his wife Tsjutsi and their staff made it a great stay. Great hospitality, delicious food, superb beds, great coffee in a nice traditional Ladakhi-house. And for everything you want to know about geography and culture in Ladakh, Jan is your man.  Ladakh by car is probably astonishing, but Ladakh by bicycle, with support from our great guide Giatso, is unforgettable!",subdivo,/Profile/subdivo13,,50
ladakh,"The Shyok River Lodge was clearly the best guesthouse we stayed in during our 3,5 weeks in Ladakh. The lodge nicely combines Ladakhi style with comfort and tidiness. Jan and his wife are very nice and friendly hosts which made our stay (2 adults with two kids, 11 and 14y) very enjoable. The food is excellent and we enjoyed fresh fruits and salad without having any problems. They did a great job in providing gluten-free food for our daughter. The whole team is very nice and friendly serving joghurt with fresh fruits, pancakes etc in the morning and delicious dinner. Jan's tour around Shyok were very informative and gave interesting insights into the daily life. If we go again to Ladakh, we would definitely visit Shyok River lodge again.",Thomas M,/Profile/thomasmS8599GO,,50
ladakh,"For all reasons this is a place I want to come back. Most friendly and helpful owners of the lodge, so lovely and great the impression of the lodge. Everything about the lodge and its owners was exceptional, the room was clean, stylish with excellent service. Food was beyond good. The trips in the neighborhood (the Pangong Lake and the local monastery) were excellent. I hope to be back for a longer visit in the future. Thank you Jan.",emmiepoutsma,/Profile/emmiepoutsma,"Leiden, The Netherlands",50
ladakh,"About the lodge itself: very comfortable and clean rooms, delicious food and very nice, warm people.   The primary reason to come here is the spectacular scenery and the sweet Ladakhi people. We stayed at the lodge for a couple of days, 3 days is probably the shortest you should stay.   While we stayed here we went  on a number of trips in the neighborhood and enjoyed the gorgeous views, many birds (you will see lots of hoopoes, and a lammergeier if you're lucky) and the local monastery. The owner told us a lot about the farmers in the village, how they grow crops and work together to eke out an existence in this forbidding climate. A must-see in the area is Pangong lake, with its azure blue waters, easily as beautiful as Namtso lake in Tibet.",Menno B,/Profile/mennob271,,50
ladakh,"This beautiful homestay / guesthouse is definitely worth the journey. I spent 3 days at Shyok and loved waking up to views over the dramatic Karakoram mountains. This is Ladakh at its unspoilt and what you see here is local life at its purest. Jan took us around the local village and we got to understand much more about the delicate ecosystems in Ladakh as well as the culture - this was a highly memorable part of my trip to Ladakh and I would not hesitate to recommend Shyok River Lodge to anyone looking to appreciate the true beauty of Ladakh. Come here for some peace, quiet, beautiful nature and authenticity. Thank you for a great stay! PS the beds are so comfortable...",Trundler83,/Profile/Trundler83,London,50
ladakh,"This is the own lodge of our travel agent Jan (Better Places). We were booked here for three nights, but ONE night would have been better, since going to the Pangong Tso (lake) and returning means driving the same (short, 45 minute) section of the road three times.   Also the small Shyok village can be visited in two hours in the afternoon upon arrival. By the first of October, there is nothing much to do by way of working alongside the local villagers (planting, harvesting, etc.). In addition, after a month of travelling in the area and visiting (lodging in) numerous villages, this village had nothing new to offer us, requiring an extra day/night to explore.     The bedroom. The bed matress and linnen were excellent, but the first morning, the warm water valve of the shower was",huys25,/Profile/huys25,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",20
ladakh,"We spent beautiful moments with Jan and his wife: discovering the local culture, meeting local people, even looking for the snow leopard in asthonishing landscapes.  We also particularly enjoyed the interesting and diverse discussions we had around delicious meals. No doubt all this was possible thanks to the cozy place they set up and their love for this beautiful region.",Sébastien B,/Profile/200s_bastienb,,50
ladakh,"Everything that is special about visiting Ladakh comes together at Shyok River Lodge. Beautiful scenery, the peacefulness of a charming village, and a very nice location to explore the valleys and mountains from. The lodge is a little gem in itself: very comfortable, excellent food, and decorated with luxurious feel to it, while it is completely blended into the local village style. Jan and his family are very kind hosts very knowledgeable, and will make sure that you have the most wonderful time during your stay. We stayed in August 2016 with three teenage kids, who also loved it.",Dutchtravelfamily,/Profile/Dutchtravelfamily,"Haarlem, The Netherlands",50
ladakh,"Everything already written in other reviews about the fabulous beauty of this region, the comfortable and immaculate lodgings, and the amazing food is absolutely true!   And beyond that I found such joy in being with the people of Shyok and with Jan, Suchi and their sweet daughter.  Our home family and the villagers were wonderfully open and welcoming.  The smiles they sent my way showed me the joy they felt in life, and that they wished the same joy for me. We were lucky enough to be there during the annual home blessing. We were invited by the family to participate in the culminating ceremony one evening.  We sat with them in the shrine room as two local lamas chanted and beat a drum and directed the ceremony.  We participated in this activity as if we were family members. Jan",LeighandLarry,/Profile/LeighandLarry,"Bellevue, Washington",50
ladakh,"A haven of peace in the heart of a varied and outstanding landscape. Shyok river lodge is managed by Jan and his wife who know what comfort and kindness mean.The typical ladakhi house has been built and decorated brilliantly : rooms and bathrooms are perfect, the food is wonderful (fresh, home made, various, full of flavours).  Furthermore, Jan is a mine of informations about local traditions, wildlife, geography and history, touristic or not touristic sites and treks. We were sad to leave!!!",Agnès A,/Profile/117agn_sa,"Paris, France",50
