ladakh,"This guest house has a pretty nice ambience and a kitchen where guests can cook for themselves. There's a nice big garden. The location is good. Rooms are comfortable enough and clean, and rates are decent. I was checking it out for a friend who is coming. A single room is Rs600. There's construction going on nearby, so it wouldn't be quiet all the time.  Regarding the other review, though there's less of a problem in Ladakh than most other places, it's always necessary to be careful with valuables. The other reviewer didn't mention if the bag was unlocked or if the person broke into it. In any case, anyone staying here should be careful with their belongings and not leave their room or bag unlocked..",Peregrineri,/Profile/Peregrineri,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"The location, room, ammenities were all very nice. The flower garden is wonderful. After two months staying here, the worker Ooh-mesh went into my room and stole 10,000 rupees from my bag. The owners, who were nice until this point, were defensive and rude when I told them about the missing money.",clintonjhowell,/Profile/clintonjhowell,"El Escorial, Spain",10
