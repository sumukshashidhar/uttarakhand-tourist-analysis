ladakh,Excellent place. Staff and Owners are very much hospitable.  Had a great time there. I was with family with a 3 year old kid and found the place safe n sound. Highly recommended.  Moreover the place is situated in the heart of the Hunder Valley which adds to it charisma.,Dr Shafeen,/Profile/drrsshafi,,50
ladakh,"Very friendly and hospitable hosts and staff. Very clean room. They offered two double beds in a room which was good as we were a family of three. Excellent location. The ability to be able to do star gazing from their balcony was a surprise and bonus. The room is big and the common area outside the room gives a feeling of openness. The vegetable and fruit garden was beautiful. Was a bit overpriced perhaps, but we pretty much enjoyed everything at the guest house. Zaheer's hospitality and warmth makes up for any shortcomings one may experience, if at all.",Triflyer,/Profile/Triflyer,India,50

Though due to lack of internet they provide me wrong room (lower budget one) but later when the owner realized of the mistake they took care of our food bills and adjusted the same with room cost. He was very apologetic on the mistake and did his best to make us feel comfortable and also offered us Apples from his farm.

The cook was punjabi and he served us a delicious buffet dinner. The garden in front is beautiful one with apple tree, apricot tree and lehberry tree.  Only con is that in Nubra valley there is frequent power cut. After 11 PM, the power is out for whole night. The emergency light is only in the room and not in bathroom.

Floor was carpeted and the guests need to remove the footwear at the entrance. There was a small lawn in front with nice smelling rose bushes and some apricot trees. A kitchen garden in the backyard supplied fresh vegetables to the small eatery run by the guest house. The hospitality that one expects in a guest house is missing. While the other 3 guest house I stayed in during my Ladakh visit showed generosity while billing for food, here the approach looked commercial. Perhaps the owner has completely left this to caretakers. Nothing good to write about the food served in the in-house dining",Gowruv,/Profile/Gowruv,"Ghaziabad, India",40

ladakh,"Visited Nubra Valley in May 2018 and opted to stay at Oglok Guest House instead of a tent and do not regret that choice at all. This was one of the best accommodations we had in Ladakh. The rooms are spacious yet cozy and the common living area was a highlight. During our visit, there was electricity supply only in  the evening- 7pm to 11pm. But that was fine as long hours of sunlight and the cold climate did not warrant need for electricity. The staff was very accommodating with making meals of our choice (though limited to North Indian food). We would receive piping hot meals at all times. Keep in mind this a guest house in one of the most remote parts of India and hence does not match with luxuries in big cities.

Although our room was having some weird smell we managed with some aggarbatti which the staff provided us. The room was spacious, sufficiently clean and tidy.

To begin with, it's a proper ""Home Stay"" option, Hence, Pls don't expect any 4- 5 star kind of arrangements or reception - Infact, there aren't any 5 star stay options @ Nubra Valley.  That being said, I was simply swayed by the pure serenity, scenic beauty and closeness to nature at this place. The accommodation is quite ""Basis"", yet very satisfying and comforting.  Couple of things to remember before you make a final decision are as follows:  Electricity is only available from 7 P.M to 11 P.M (that too by generator) Wi-Fi connectivity is intermittent and subject to electricity Hot water is only available till 11 A.M at the most",NarenderNaruka,/Profile/NarenderNaruka,"New Delhi, India",50

ladakh,"We visited Olgok Guest House on 23rd Sep'17. The hospitality by Mr.Zahoor (Zahoor Chacha as we called him), the location of the guest house and ofcourse the spik and span condition of the room tempted us to stay at Olgok for an additional night.      It is not very far from the sand dunes which is an added advantage.     Zahoor Chacha grows his own vegetables in the backyard and undoubtedly the dinner at Olgok tasted so fresh and naturally sweet.     Having 24 hour running water is a luxury in places like Hunder and we were able to enjoy hot water baths at Olgok after a tiring day.

The guy working there showed us our room, which was pretty basic, but we had opted for a 'standard room' so no complaints there. Our room was clean and had a coffee table, fan, en suite.   One point to make for all those creepy crawly cringers - Hunder is in the middle of open land, so expect to have lots of bees, moths and other insects around you!

The staff and owner, Mr Zahoor were extremely friendly and made our stay super comfortable. Amidst Ladakh's beauty, this small guest house is like a weekend farmhouse.

ladakh,"This was my second hotel stay in Nubra Valley, we had booked it just last minute...the place is more like a home stay with 6-7 large rooms...it‚Äôs very basic for a couple of nights stay. The Old uncle that takes care of the property is very friendly and helpful...the food was also good just like home...  Overall it was more like a homely experience....Hot water was also available without any problems. However, it will be more suitable for big groups and families than for couples.",Constance55555,/Profile/Constance55555,"Mumbai, India",40

You can't ask for anything more here. You can easily spend a couple of days here.

The owner is charming and very helpful and has a good relationship with his employee which was nice to see.  It's a nice setting, and although it's not The Ritz, it's more than adequate for most needs of travellers. We paid 600 per night and were very happy with what we got.

ladakh,"The Olgok Guesthouse in Hunder, Nubra Valley is a very basic place for an overnight stay. The room is nondescript and sparsely furnished. Tables and chairs were full of dust. The bed is very firm. The bathroom is clean and shower in good working condition with plenty of solar panel heated hot water and good pressure (in summer time). Towels can be provided at request. Make sure you bring your own toiletries including toilette paper. ¬†Dinner is rudimentary and tasteless- one daal and one veggie dish plus rice and chapattis. Mint tea was good. The owner is friendly and helpful. Comfortable accommodation options in Nubra valley are very limited. Most tourists stay in tents.

Mr. Zahoor Mohammed's hospitality was simply heartening and also a special thanks to Kuldeep, the cook for providing such amazing food and fulfilling all our odd demands. The place can accommodate 3-4 couples and provides all the amenities. The place has a solar panel so hot water is also not an issue.The staff was very warm and provided us with whatever we required.

ladakh,"Stayed at Olgok in June 2014. Our group consisted of three families with kids between 8 and 12 years of age.   We checked out some other accommodation options during our stay in Nubra and found that there are many new guest houses and very good luxury tented accommodation that are much better than Olgok.(The new guest houses may not be listed or highly rated because they don't have enough reviews.) Unfortunately, we had pre-paid at the Olgok for our whole group and the other places did not have enough rooms available at the last minute, so we were stuck for two unpleasant nights.   All but one of the rooms are large enough for an extra bed, which the owners did not tell us when booking (so we unnecessarily booked separate rooms for the kids). The bathrooms are relatively new but",slopes2sea,/Profile/slopes2sea,"Mumbai, India",10
ladakh,"The reviewer who did not like this place obviously expected a more upmarket accommodation (such as the tent camps, which are MUCH more expensive). Residents of Nubra valley have a modest lifestyle, of which you can have a glimpse by staying in a very economic but comfortable home stay such as this. The garden is not as well kept as you might see in large guest houses and hotels because it is managed by only the family. The fact that you are in the middle of family life - washing dishes etc - is part of the charm, but yes, did add to the noise level. Otherwise the location is extremely tranquil. The room and bed were very comfortable (we requested an extra top sheet), and it's quite amazing to me that you can now stay in such budget accommodation and have a sparkling clean",belinda-ann,/Profile/belinda-ann,"sydney, australia",50

We were asked to choose any room as we were the only guests and we were also upgraded to an expensive, bigger room at no additional cost. Rooms was big and cozy and very clean.

There is no better word than ""Vacation Home"" to explain this place, the lush green garden with stream flowing through it and the view of mountains, the large rooms with clean bathrooms, the peace and tranquility and to top it up the hosts are just wonderful.They go out of their way to make your stay comfortable   The food was simple homemade but a delight, you are served breakfast in the garden where you can just relax and enjoy hot cups of tea   I would certainly recommend this place for your stay in Hunder",Rajat79,/Profile/Rajat79,"New Delhi, India",50
