ladakh,"I stayed in this hotel in April for 3 nights and I can honestly say that it's one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in.  Away from the noise and pollution of the city, this hotel is set down the hill next to the Indus River where it is peaceful. The staff are polite and very friendly and the interior decor of the building is superb, akin to a Tibetan monastery with the colours and Buddhist art.   The food is great too and I would happily recommend this hotel to anyone who stays in Leh.   The manager, Stanzing, arranged all of my trips and couldn't do enough to help me.",Thomas W,/Profile/K8919UAthomasw,"Southport, United Kingdom",50
