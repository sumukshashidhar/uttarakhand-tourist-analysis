ladakh,"This place is a trap for trekkers going on Chadar trek via International Youth Club. There are zero facilities - bathroom floor would be frozen up, no hot water, actually no water at all in the flush, bad food.  Avoid staying at this place if possible. Avoid going on trek with International Youth Club if possible. The owner Tahir Galwan, and the trek organizer Ankit Verma will mislead you with lies before the trek, and then completely deny it with a straight face afterwards. Not trustworthy folks.",The Wandering Gnu,/Profile/the_wandering_gnu,,10
ladakh,"Worst hotel in Leh. We stayed here for 4 nights in Jan2020. Go here only if you’re left with no other choice. This will be a complete spoiler of your trip. Rooms are terrible, roof of the room drips/droplets freezes in night. Money minded for everything. Bashir who works here is always looking for opportunities for looting money from guests. Food is horrible. They don’t even make good coffee. Bathrooms are dirty and slippery. Charged 3000 bucks for 3 people. You can find much better options with in 100m of this like Mountain Retreat...",AmitGovil,/Profile/AmitGovil,"Bengaluru, India",10
ladakh,Stay was good. Some rooms are good and have clean bathroom. Food provided was not good. Nice hospitality and tahir was knowledgable about the trek so provided good tips and advice. All in all a fine experience. ,randhir-82,/Profile/randhir-82,"Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,It was a comfortable room with an average view .. Though the owner was a bit rude but The service boys were really nice and had good hospitality . Food not upto the expectations . Would recommend only if no other options available,Keshav L,/Profile/keshavl2018,"New Delhi, India",30
ladakh,"I reached the hotel a bit later than check in time and they hadn't got my reservations untill they had refreshed their system, they have a very bad service and try to save money by not providing basic facilities, you don't get hot water and the complimentary morning breakfast won't even fill half of your stomach, I wouldn't refer this place to anyone.",Leon G,/Profile/leongeorge09,"Kochi (Cochin), India",30
ladakh,"We stayed in the hotel for 5 days. Tahir was an incredible host. He was friendly and welcoming. Since we are from south India, we thought we might have a problem with food at Leh. But the food was very tasty at the hotel. Thanks to the cook. The staff were good, disciplined. The stay was peaceful and memorable. Thanks Tahir and Galwan palace for your service.",Shiva K,/Profile/ShivaK59,,50
ladakh,"Rooms are good and spacious. Food is just like one's home and you need that when you are in Ladakh. Tahir was a great host, please count on his expertise as you will need someone who is well accustomed.   Had arranged for a complimentary bonfire and cake as it was my first anniversary. Wifi is there, and you can definitely leave everything to Tahir to plan the trip.",Vivek S,/Profile/VivekS2960,,40
ladakh,The name is too catchy but the place is not. It had bedbugs and insects all around. Toilets were dirty and wash basin was broken. It had spit marks on the wall. Had a very bad experience. Not at all co-operative people unlike the other Ladakhi's. We will never recommend this place to anyone.,Stuntmania,/Profile/Stuntmania,,10
ladakh,"The hotel is very conveniently located near the centre of Leh, which is about a 5 minute walk. The rooms were clean and comfortable and the staff were very friendly. The food was very tasty and I enjoyed the breakfasts and dinners. Overall, it was a good place to stay in Leh. We enjoyed the hospitality and food of Hotel Galwan Palace. It was a good experience. The rooms were neat and clean. The people of leh were very kind and disciplined.The vehicle drivers provided by the hotel are very good and experienced.",Ashutosh B,/Profile/AshutoshB182,,50
ladakh,"Stayed here for 5 days. It was very nice stay. They behaved me like a family member. Bonfire was amazing with barbeque and some light music it was amazing weekend.World's highest motorable pass Khardung La is just 35 km. away from here..Leh palace,, Shanti Stupa and so many tourist attractions are very close to hotel.. They also provide car facility, treking facility also..",Kranthi K,/Profile/KranthiK195,,50
ladakh,"We have stayed 3 days in Galwan Guest House, Leh on 22nd-Aug, 24th-Aug, 26th Aug as part of my 10 Days trip to Delhi-Leh-Manali. Our Package was arranged by Monks and Monkeys.     mnmtravels(Monks and Monkeys) completely hand over the responsibility of all the arrangements to a person called Gomz who is part of Galwan's Guest house once you reached Leh. This person starts negotiating from the first day on the places to be visited, even though its part of the package, Gomez says I am not aware of the package, so not possible to cover those etc.Let us come to the Hotel part. This is not at all a up to the mark hotel to stay more than a night..  1. Food - Always same. For breakfast Aloo Parota & Dhahi or Bread and for Dinner always Roti with Aloo subji & Dhal Chawal. No change in",vishnumoorthi b,/Profile/vishnumoorthi,"Bengaluru, India",20
ladakh,"I rated excellent because, in place like leh which is natures adobe, you may not spend much time in room. It is located in cool changspa road in peaceful atmosphere. At the same time you can reach Leh market by walk 10 min in viewful road overlooking shanti stupa. Also this road is very much touristy with lot of shops, hotels, bike taxi shops etc. It is a small hotel & you get personnel attention from cook & care taker. Get to the terrace to enjy the beautiful evening from where you can view Shanti stupa & hill towards Khardugla. & I feel food is good with low spice, similar to our home food. But remember rooms are simple, no heater. However hot water is available full day.",jeettt,/Profile/jeettt,,50
