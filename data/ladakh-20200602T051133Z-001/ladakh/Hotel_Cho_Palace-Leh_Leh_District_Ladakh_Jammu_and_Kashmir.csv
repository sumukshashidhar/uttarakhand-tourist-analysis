The personal touch provided by Mr Wangchuk and his team was excellent. Any request made by us was honored with smile. The vehicle (a Mahindra Xylo) and the driver too was very good and the driver had all inclination to cover all the tourist places of our trip.

Second, the staff is very helpful and they take good care of their guests. You can bank on the staff of the hotel at any hour of the day. The supervisor of the hotel guided us on the routes we were about to take to reach different places in Ladakh (Sham Valley, Nubra, Pangong).

Unfortunately, all of them seemed to make their own recommendations about what's best with near disregard for what we wanted as tourists.   We are so thankful to Cho Palace for responding when they did!   Mr. Singay Wangchuk, the owner, incorporated all our sightseeing plans into a wonderfully neat and organized schedule, exactly as we wanted....making the best of time and budget. I think Mr. Singay understands very well that holidaymakers must be left to have their own experiences, good or bad, and that meddling with plans otherwise is unkind and frustrating.

ladakh,We stayed here in Hotel Cho Palace as a couple and I found it very very pleasant place to spend your holidays. The good part of this hotel is its proximity to the Leh airport which is like 5 minutes drive. So you dont have to travel a lot after your flight.  On the downside this hotel is at quite some distance from the main city and market so if you need something then you will have to take a cab to and fro market which will cost you between 300-400 INR.  Nevertheless the hotel is very scenic and you can see snow covered peaks(depends on the time of year) all around. This hotel provides an absolute gorgeous view of sunrise and sunset and you can spend hours looking at the surroundings.  Most rooms are of decent size and have all required  amenities.

We had taken a package directly from the hotel which included all stay, sightseeing to Nubra and pangong and MAP basis with extra bed as we had a child with us.  The hotel staff is very courteous and helpful. The food served is very good and we had no difficulty with the kids. We used the hotel as a base for our trips to Nubra and Pangong. Mr Singhe even gave us a spare can of oxygen to carry in case we needed one on higher altitudes.",32Rishi32,/Profile/32Rishi32,"Sydney, Australia",50

ladakh,"Do not expect exotic hotels in Ladhakh. Staff is warm and humble. Service is good. Quality of rooms is not upto the mark of leading hotels. Food quality is also average. Not highly recommended for long and continuous stays. Good place for short stays while shuttling around to Nubra valley, Pangong and other places.",Travank,/Profile/Travank,"New Delhi, India",30

ladakh,Three star standards. Friendly efficient staff. Tends to get crowded as it is a favourite choice of tour operators.

ladakh,"Decent little place. Leh doesnt have opulent hotels, mostly budget fare and this fits squarely in the profile.   The good- 1. Excellent view  2. Near to airport  3. Peaceful, away from the main market  4. Better than average food  5. Cozy rooms  6. Helpful service  7. Clean, well maintained  The bad- 1. Located way off the city, and does not offer a complimentary pick up/drop facility to the market and other places  2. Genset power backup inadequate  3. Food quality inconsistent  You get what you pay for, utimately.",Achyuta G,/Profile/achyutaghosh,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
ladakh,"I stayed there for 5 nights, rooms are OK. They dont generator very often. Most of the time online portal do give bookings to this hotel, but its very very very far off from the market. If u are in market till 7.30 or 8 in the evening then probably u will find very difficult to go this hotel. And most of the cab people avoid going to this area, as they dont get any return fare. If u come out of the hotel, unless the hotel people dont call cabs, u cannot find any cab on your own to go to the market. Food was also not upto to the mark. Only plus point is the owner handles the hotel on its own, and charges very less then what is charged in the market.",RameshNaidu,/Profile/RameshNaidu,Mumbai,30
ladakh,"Nice little hotel with basic but good rooms and a good view. We used this hotel as our base camp. Right from the manager, to cleaners/ porters (2 girls) and the restaurant staff - everyone tries their best. Inspite of the harsh conditions - they are always cheerful and that gets your spirits up! Each time we came back from an overnight trip - they gave us a warm welcome and the same rooms for comfort! The cabs take approx 300 to the market. You will have to spend that as the market is not walking distance. The food is average  - but served with a smile :-) . The terrace is a nice place to sit and play cards, chit chat. There is free Wifi in the lobby (if i remember correctly)",00NJ,/Profile/00NJ,India,40
ladakh,"We took the Yatra.com packaged tour program fro Leh. They made the entire group stay in three different hotels next to each other and since I visited all the three hotels I could compare the pros and cons of the various hotels. I would rank Cho Palace as One, The Kaal as second and worst being the Silk Route Inn.  1.	Food: The foods are pathetic in all the hotels and they claim there aren’t many vegetables which grow in the neighborhood which is the main reason for this pathetic food quality but that doesn’t justify the distasteful food as the restaurant in the market place serve some mouth watering dishes.   2.	Location: Although it’s near to Airport why would anybody want to stay near Airport and not Market Place? You have to and fro to Airport only once whereas Market Place",Soumyaa,/Profile/Soumyaa,"Newport, New Jersey",30
ladakh,"We stayed in the hotel for 4 nights in total at different times as we were on the move travelling around in Leh Ladakh. the first 2 nights we had a really good service but other 2 nights the service lacked, may be they took the backseat as we kept coming back to stay with them. The hotel is not far from the airport and only 10mins from the main market. We preferred as it s away from the hustle bustle and provides good views of the mountains/Leh valley. The hotel offers free wifi in the lobby area, has open terrace to enjoy the breakfast and tea with those breath taking views. the hotel offers buffet for the dinner but variety is average so we had a la carte.  The rooms and bathroom are basic, would give it 1.5star, housekeeping doesnt seem to get enough time due turn around of",upg_uk,/Profile/upg_uk,uk,30

Cons:  1. far from market. 2. Exorbitant high price for ala carte food, tea and mineral water. 3. Dim lights and No fan (staff told fan is not present in any hotel room in leh) 4. High priced taxi pick up for market.  Suggestions:  1. Daily Pickup taxi to and fro market should be provided. 2. Price of food menu should be reduced. 3. Bigger tube lights and if possible fan should be provided in the room.  Keep improving!!",shainesh b,/Profile/ShaineshB,"Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India",40

ladakh,"We landed to the breathtaking city of Leh and reached the hotel super quickly. Its a nice little hotel tucked away in the Skara area of Leh. We were welcomed with smiling and helpful staff. The view of the room is spectacular (Photo of the view attached) - the majestic mountain range and lush green fields around the hotel.  There is a lovely patio to sit and chill in the evenings sipping tea. Great Breakfast, loved the homemade apricot jam :)  For the site seeing we had our pickup cabs but on impromptu visits to the Leh Market we had to call for a Cab as it was about 2 km from the Market which got a little expensive as we would head to the market for dinner each night.

Haven't tried the room service or food at this hotel, as we had our packed vegetarian food from The Kaal Hotel nearby.

Hotel has around 30 rooms and usually there are one or more tourist groups are there. I understand that it was open only in the summer season (till early September) but it's is good ""Value for Money"" hotel. Food quality is decent though you need to confirm about the Lunch as many times they don't prepare the buffet if the group staying has gone for long trip to Pangong Lake, Nubra Valley etc. Staff is couretous.",ghuman_gaya_si,/Profile/ghuman_gaya_si,"Mumbai, India",40

The staff are friendly and willing to go an extra mile. The view from every room is amazing, wide windows give you a spectacular view of the mighty Himalayas, although electricity is a huge problem there are constant power cuts, the hotel is equipped with a inverter / generator. The hotel is good for families too especially people travelling with children. During my stay I met at least 5 families with kids and all seemed happy with the place and arrangements in the room.
