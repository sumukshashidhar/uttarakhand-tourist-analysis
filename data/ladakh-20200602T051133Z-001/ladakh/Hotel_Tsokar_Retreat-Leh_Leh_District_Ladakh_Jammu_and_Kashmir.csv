ladakh,We enjoyed several days stay at this property in the late season (Oct 2019). The location is very convenient to central Leh and the hotel is surrounded by lovely gardens. Cannot say enough about the excellent and caring service by the entire staff. My husband was even helped with altitude sickness avoiding a trip to Emerg. Great food in the dining room as well! Highly recommended.,"JandD - Toronto, Canada",/Profile/JandD-TorontoCanada,,50
