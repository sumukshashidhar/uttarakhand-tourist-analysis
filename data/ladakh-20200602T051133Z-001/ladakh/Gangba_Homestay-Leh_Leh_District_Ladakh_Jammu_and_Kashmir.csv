ladakh,"This was our fourth annual visit to Leh and Gangba and our longest stay to date - a total of three weeks. What a pleasure they were in this immaculately clean and comfortable homestay.  For the first time, I suffered from altitude sickness and was grateful for the immediate care provided and action taken by both Stanzin and Dolma in getting me the services of their own excellent doctor.  Would we stay there again? We absolutely intend to. As always, the privacy, comfort and warmth extended to us at Gangba is priceless and we do indeed look forward to staying with them again next year.   There is no greater recommendation I can make.

And after staying here I am really grateful to my relative that he recommended this place to stay. The staff here is amazinly cooperative, the rooms are very clean and comfortable, the location is just great, the view from the gallery is breathtaking and the food served is just too good. Since we were travelling from Pune to Leh by car, there vwas ample space to park our car. I have never met a host as friendly as Mr.Stanzin who owes this place. He was always ready to offer whatever help was required from him. Since our car had developed certain problems on account of low oxygen at Leh, Mr.Stanzin was always a call away from answering his solutions.",pendharkar2015,/Profile/pendharkar2015,"Pune, India",50

Ownership is unchanged with Mr. Stanzin W. and his wife Dolma, and I also had a chance to chat with their college-age daughter, Stanzin's mom who is still out every day in her 80's, and their delightful adopted 5 year old daughter Lhazes. Staff this year is a group of helpful and polite young men from Agra. The main catchword for Gangba I would say is flexibility.  Whatever your needs or plans are, Stanzin, Dolma and the staff can make it work. For me, this included arranging a ""rescue"" driver when travel plans went awry, storing miscellaneous trekking gear safely, visiting a local clinic, organizing nearby taxi rides and hotel reservations, and so on.",viralimm,/Profile/viralimm,"Seattle, Washington",50

ladakh,Stayed at Gangba during the last week of June. Rooms were nothing great to speak about with lots of construction noise going around as the guest house was adding rooms. The other is very friendly but that's about it. The hotel is at least 20-25 minutes walk from the main market and returning to the hotel after dinner at 9pm became a p project for us. The roads were pitch dark (power cuts are common in leh) work stray dogs barking all around. The hotel did not even have a illuminated sign board.  Overall it was a bad experience. Better to stay near Fort road if you are not on extreme budget.,Charnock19,/Profile/Charnock19,"Dallas, Texas",20

I have a gluten intolerance so Yanghen and her staff accomodated to my needs for breakfast and any other meal I would have at the guesthouse.   The food is the best in town, freshly prepared everyday and straight from the family garden.   The rooms (I stayed in two different rooms before and after my trek)  are clean and perfectly comfortable. The views from all the rooms are stunning.

Thankfully our decision was absolutely right and we loved the total duration of our stay at Gangba. On reaching the property we were simply taken away by the quiet, calm location of the homestayl. Though a good 15 minutes walk to Leh city from hotel, but still we loved the sereneness of the place. Very good view of the snow-capped mountains and the Shanti Stupa from the hotel site.

Right from our first telephonic and subsequent email exchanges with Mr. Stanzin, we were made to feel that we should rest assured and come to Ladakh and everything would be taken care of and he truly over delivered on his promise!

Thanks to the owner Stanzin and his family, they will ensure you wont miss your Home while you are with them.  2. The food though it is Vegetarian was really good.

Good view of Shanti Stupa. 15 minute walk from market/restaurants. If you are returning after dark,  essential to get a taxi since streets don't have lights.   Rooms - We stayed in the new wing for most part. Recently constructed. Very good quality. Old rooms are less spacious. Avoid the old rooms on ground floor closest to common area.  Food - Breakfast is excellent. Khambir (local bread) with eggs, apricot jam and butter on many days. Dinner - we preferred the variety offered by town restaurants.

We had great time with their kid, wife and dog and carried out easy conversations with Mr. Stanzin and Shitanshu Sir. The simplicity in their lifestyle brought us close to their culture and made us feel very attached to Leh. We stayed there for 8 days but the days just passed by quickly and at the end we never wanted to leave from there.  The food was simple, so no chances of stomach upsets which we often face while traveling. Plus it was served with such an affection that we could feel the happiness they felt while serving us.

There's plenty of bottled water, and the rooms were clean and tidy with on-demand hot water.

The rooms are well appointed and we had a superb view of the Shanti Stupa and the snow covered mountains.

After reaching Gangba, few more people were there to receive us, the whole Gangba Family (along with their pet Tommy) :)  One very interesting thing about them is they offer you their staple food, but they also strive to cook food in your style which actually justifies the statement ""Home away from home"" They also helped us a lot in making our celebrations like Birthdays and anniversaries special.....  * Local travel was arranged by them and have also helped in planning which places to visit. * Clean rooms * Food was always served hot (with lots of love",Vamsi2405,/Profile/Vamsi2405,"Hyderabad, India",50

They treated me to not only the most delicious meals, but also to the most interesting tales of life in the Himalayas. I have yet to experience sub zero winter in Ladakh and I hope to do so soon!  Some of my favourite memories staying at Gangba include playing 'Ghost' with Cho-cho  (the adorable daughter of the homestay owners), going out with Yangchen lay to the fields to check on the crops and going on excursions with Acho and the entire family.
