ladakh,"Looks good in the photos, but were probably taken a few years ago. Arrived in cold wet weather, and the best I can say is that the tents didn't leak. There was nothing warm and welcoming about this camp, which was past its 'use by' date. The setting is very nice but it deserves a better camp. Tents were basic, with broken zips and dangerous looking electrics, which didn't work - take a torch. Nowhere to charge a phone. Toilets were disgusting.",Glenn P,/Profile/680glennp,,10
ladakh,"The photos looks quite good but the reality is an desaster.  Be sure to have your sleeping bag with you, and close it with precaution, because there were rats around the camp. Look for another possibility to camp in this area. You only can find better.",Gilbert K,/Profile/GilbertK226,,10
ladakh,Imagine a wide field spread across miles. Imagine a distant range of mountains. Imagine chill winds blowing and then imagine a series of tents in the middle with great friendly staff and warm food. We stayed there during the monsoons along with a group of bikers. The lake was at a distance but the view awesome. The tents are on raw ground with no flooring but this was the shelter we needed. Not for the light hearted - this is no luxury stay. The staff was brilliant with food in such a remote location. The toilets outside. This place is mostly a halt for bikers who do the Manali Leh circuit.,Debashis D,/Profile/Debashis_Dey,"Kolkata, India",40
ladakh,"Prima esperienza di un campo tendato in Ladakh, dei 5 fatti questo si è rivelato essere il meno confortevole, ma solo per via dei bagni in comune, niente di tragico (anche se dover uscire alle 2 di notte al freddo ed al buio non è il massimo). Le tende sono tutte a due posti. Per cena deve esserci un menu comune a tutti i campi tendati perchè è sempre stato il medesimo, probabilmente per una questione di praticità. Si può evitare di portarsi il sacco a pelo (ma un sacco lenzuolo si) perchè le coperte bastano ed avanzano anche se siamo a 4531 metri. Il lago lo si può raggiungere anche a piedi in 15'.",Monica B,/Profile/Monia553,"Milan, Italy",30
ladakh,Si tratta di un discreto campo tendato posto ai margini del lago di Tsokar. Il posto è molto bello e molto isolato. Tranquillissimo. Le tende sono pulite ma non dispongono di servizi privati. E' consigliato portarsi il proprio sacco a pelo o sacco lenzuolo. Nessuna possibilità di connessione internet. Pasti discreti. Personale gentile.,ctaMonza,/Profile/ctaMonza,"Brugherio, Italy",30
ladakh,"I have visited there in April 2015 with my family rooms was very good and staff and service was very impressed , food was good I have spend 6 days 5 nights there I didn't feel any single problem and looks like home .",Njoshi844,/Profile/Njoshi844,"Leh, India",50
ladakh,"I was here with my wife in September 2015. This camp was just too good. The staffs were super helpful and very well behaved. Food was quite good and we didn't face any issue, except for the problem that water in toilet was frozen ;-) however no one can help in such cases. The manager was very helpful. This camp is around 3-4KM from Tso-kar Lake in an isolated place surrounded by mountains from all around. Overall a fantabulous stay. ",Amit S,/Profile/562amits,,50

ladakh,"DELIGHT CAMP is the new sight at Tsokar Lake. The owner is having his camp sight at Pangong  Lake. The sight is 7 Km far from Tsokar lake on the way to Manali Road. The sight is quite Isolated hence it is very very peaceful. Currently there are only 10 TENTS. Tents are very clean and having Double BED. Toilet is common but well maintained, clean and running water. The Owner is very humble person who take cares of everything. Food preparation and presentation and at but not least food taste was very very good. Surprising They serve us Soup as well as Sweet in the Dinner. Really it was surprise to us. The stay is Available on MAP BASIS.",shaileshu10,/Profile/shaileshu10,"Dombivli, India",50
