ladakh,Staff very very helpful and co-operative. Fairly clean room. Staff arranged for packed breakfast and hot water at very early hours in the morning. Wasn't very impressed with the management from what seemed like noone bothering to set internet right for the time we were there. It seems it needed some fixing. The property maintenance (open areas) leaves a lot to be desired.,Triflyer,/Profile/Triflyer,India,30
ladakh,"The drive down to the lush Nubra valley from Leh through the mighty mountains and Khardong La is a fantastic experience. We stayed at Sumoor, further away from the more popular Hunder or Diskit villages after crossing the Shyok river. The camp is well located in an isolated area- the tents are very well maintained and the courteous staff served us hot and delicious meals.The surprise was running hot water in the cold mornings provided through solar heaters! We stayed for two nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay driving around the fascinating Nubra valley. Highlight was the drive to Tur Tuk village and glimpses of the LOC near Gilgit- Baltistan. Got an opportunity to see the conditions under which our heroic armed forces serve and strive to keep us safe.",sudarshan_pv,/Profile/sudarshan_pv,bengaluru,50

ladakh,"Imagine 3 days with No TV, No Mobile network, No Wifi, No newspapers. we lived that and was an out of the world experience. Waking up to the chirping of birds and the howling winds. Coming out of the tent to catch a glimpse of the sun rising between the Himalayan peaks!! Mind boggling.  Tiger Camp is literally that - a camp site. Tents, well laid out and organised. Coming from busy metros and not so safe environs, you are surprised that there is no firm door or locking system for your belongings inside the tent. it is safe.  The caretaker of the property is very helpful and accommodating. so are his helpful team.  Serving breakfast and dinner of your choice. Making special local delicacy momos for your experience. Its easy done for them.   We as a family spent more time talking",sandycool69,/Profile/sandycool69,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",40
ladakh,I had traveled the ladakh region on bike and stayed at many camps but this Tiger camp at Nubra was my best staying experience. First of all the camps are very neat and maintained good. The place is also very serene amidst the mountains and their own home farming. The food served was also good according to the conditions there. So would recommend this camp for a pleasant homely stay away from home.,Hakim L,/Profile/hakiml878,,50

ladakh,I was on photography trip to Ladakh in July 2017. We stayed in Tiger Camp for one night. That day was full moon night. Surprise was waiting for us. The rooms are looked like Tent. But well maintained and proper washroom. As I said that day was full moon night. I was feeling that I am staying in lap of the mountains that also snow claded. It was heavenly feeling. No phone net work will work there. But Hotel staffs (local people from near by villages) were so helpful. I tried to contacted my parents at home in Kolkata. One lady staff took me few steps  (2-3 minutes walk) ahead and on her mobile network was there. She gave me her mobile to speak to my parents. It was heart touching. The food was good. Breakfast was awesome. They arranged for bonfire on request.We enjoyed a lot. A,Kasturi P,/Profile/941kasturip,,50

ladakh,"Fantastic place with amazing views, the nightsky is to die for and the food is great despite the problem of staying at such a high altitude. The staff is very helpful and will with whatever problem your facing. Staying in tents was an amazing experience with cosy beds and a very clean bathroom attached from inside.",Athena A,/Profile/AthenaA108,,50
ladakh,"I had gone with my cousins and we had a fantastic time. The tents are very comfortable, clean and well maintained. The owners friendly and very helpful. The food was fantastic. The place is surrounded by mountains and it was a memorable experience for us just sitting outside the tent under the clear starry sky and chatting. ",faisalk4,/Profile/faisalk4,"Kolkata, India",50
ladakh,"The place is ok, the tents are wonderful better than what we found at Pangong. They offer decent food considering the location. Trip to Nubra was terrific. They provide the Mosquito repellent and emergency lights. Sunrise and star gazing are the only options you have to do here. They mite entertain any special request in food like i had a Jain meal request which was entertained only after lot of tantrum from the camp guy. You can go for a long walk to sit down by river as well.",Anuj J,/Profile/Anujjjoshi,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"I was traveling through the Nubra Valley of Ladakh and came across the Tiger Camp and decided to stay. The tents are all high-quality, clean and have attached private bathrooms....pretty amazing for a tent! The staff were all incredibly helpful. The setting was beautiful as it looked out to the Karakoram Mountains and the Tiger Camp property had lots of nice flowers, seating in the shade and green grass. It was a real paradise. The food was simply amazing...best meals the whole time I was in Ladakh! I was the only one there, but they prepared a feast for me at dinner and again at breakfast. I highly recommend the Tiger Camp in Nubra valley.",Jamin,/Profile/thelandofsnows,"Seattle, Washington",50
