ladakh,"The place is a little piece of heaven. The family is very warm and welcoming. You can request for local authentic food and will not be disappointed. Deskit, our host also has a collection of antiques which she shows on request. They also have apricot oil made from the apricot kernels grown at the property. Apricot juice, all authentic.  Apart from the wonderful view in this peaceful corner, I got a taste of Leh that only staying with local families bring. Very delightful!",Sheema,/Profile/Tourist00934911688,,50
ladakh,"Came across it while scrolling this site and liked it immediately. It turned out even better than expected. The rooms open to the view of the highest peak in Leh, the Stok Kangri and an apple orchard, The food was also really good. A lovely experience and Deskit, our host made it as comfortable as possible with local shopping tips and arranging taxis.",Tourist07485623095,/Profile/Tourist07485623095,,50
ladakh,"Deskit & her family have this place in the most peaceful environment in Leh. The rooms are spacious, bathrooms are clean & everything else is just amazing about this place. But above all is the host. The family is simple, religious, friendly & humble. Certain dimple gestures by the hostâ€™s family will make u feel at home and comfortable. The whole family is just a call away to comfort u.  I will definitely recommend this place to all my friends. The best of where all i have stayed in Leh.",Mukul,/Profile/Capeofgoodhopes,,50
ladakh,"1. I stayed with my wife in the lovely place for around 12 days.The family who own the farm house, made the stay extremely comfortable for us, with their great and personal hospitality.  2. The food was much tastier than those we ate outside, as it was their traditional home made food, in their private kitchen. They have a lovely dining room, where we felt so comfortable to dine and relax.  3. Beautiful interiors and management. It has a beautiful natural view of the apricot farm and facing the sunrise direction. The rooms are very clean with all amenities. Very clean and nice bathrooms, with hot running water.  4. It is located at the fort road away from the noisy and crowded areas, but it is very well located, as it takes 5 only mins to reach the market and the airport by",Kshitij M,/Profile/kshitijm2016,,50
