ladakh,"Awesome experience at Eco Exotic, Leh. Food was so yummy and tasty. Staff service is also good and helping. Very close to Mall road, Leh market, restaurants, ATMs and you can consider it is in center of the city. ",Abhishek K,/Profile/letsgobhurrr,"Pune, India",40
ladakh,"Booked this place through OYO , 2 rooms for a day.got very good deal but started with bad experience with dinner time. We asked for arranging food in room as there dining area is in open and it was a very chilled night, which was refused. No parking place. Wifi was said to be available which was important for us as there was no network, but not working. Morning for tea and breakfast everyone in hotel were searching for staff but not a single person was available till late. Finally breakfast served was hopeless. It was said to provide hot water in morning but in morning there was no hot water and an bucket heater was given to us which took 45 mins to heat 1 bucket of water. Finally we had to checkin in another guest house on next day.",Dr@UtkarshB003,/Profile/Dr_UtkarshB003,,10
ladakh,Good hotel to stay with good connectivity with market and another places but the hotel was not easy to find if you come in night they have no sign mark board or no advertising for the hotel in that area so please visit at a good time .,jatin joy krishna,/Profile/jatinjoykrishna,"Noida, India",40
ladakh,"Hotel was clean, the host was helpful. we checked in late the cook was unavailable still they allowed us to prepare maggie . the cook got up early next morning to pack breakfast for us as we had to catch an early morning flight. room was good. worth the stay. not much to view from the balcony but that is fine. a little far from the main market.",nidhi b,/Profile/nidhib268,,50
ladakh,"This hotel is a budget hotel with all modern amenities. Its located very near to the main market of Leh. This hotel has big rooms with big windows and balcony. The bright sun of Leh will always welcome you. The room views are awesome. Being far from madding crowd one will forget all his worries. The behaviour of staffs are very cordial.  Kamalesh Kamila, the owner and Director of the hotel is always available to help you. Being a National Award Winner photographer, his guidance about photography and location is surely an added advantage. ",Arnab18,/Profile/Arnab18,"Kolkata, India",50
ladakh,"The place was difficult to find as it is not very close to main bazaar it's about a 10-15 minute walk from the main bazaar. When we stayed there was lots of construction going on so the views were unsightly and the air was very dusty. The hotel itself was also under construction. The bed was pretty hard but the room was large and clean for the most part. The tv works but there aren't many English channels available, wifi worked sometimes which was a plus as it is hard to find working wifi anywhere in Leh  Unfortunately the service was not on par-- any time I went down to the lobby there was no one available for assistance. I had to walk around the building and call out ""hello?!"" To find anyone every single time. Breakfast was meant to be included but when we inquired about it",Ariana P,/Profile/811arianap,"Berkeley, California",30
