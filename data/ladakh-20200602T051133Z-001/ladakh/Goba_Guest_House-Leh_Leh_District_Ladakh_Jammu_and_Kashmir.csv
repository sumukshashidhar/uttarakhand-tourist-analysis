ladakh,This hotel is very simple hotel with all basic amenities. Very clean hotel. Value for money. Best location. Multiple food outlets around this hotel. People are very humble & nice. They also serve food but we never had a chance to eat at this hotel because we stayed here in may end at this time this hotel only provides rooms.,mkolwankar,/Profile/mkolwankar,"Thane, India",50
ladakh,"Leh is breathtakingly beautiful. Surrounded by snowy or rocky mountains, blessed with a cold breeze with beautiful sunny blue sky abd some unexpected little snow flakes. It is end of winter. .. the temperatures of 30 deg C below zero are left behind. Time to enjoy. I was blessed to have an indication to stay at GOBA. Ok... they were getting ready for the short vacations season to start by the end of May and had lots of reconstruction work going on which involves dust and noise. But this shows they do care to provide for improvements to their guests. And tourists going to Ladakh normally are not chasing for comfort and luxury,  but for the awesome beauty of the place. But the atmosphere of a home stay was all I needed and enjoyed so much. I didn't miss the opportunity of sitting",SONIA MARIA MONTEIRO,/Profile/LIKE-LIKE,"S√ÉO VICENTE, Brazil",50
ladakh,"Amazing location, our hosts were just perfect, always peaceful and smiley. Very quiet place, just beside the Shanti stupa and close to the centre. The food is very good and healthy, they have there own garden, also apple and apricot trees. I strongly recommend Goba, and I will be back in the future.

ladakh,"Stayed here for 6 nights. Not a fancy place, but you got all you want with reasonable price. The owner and her family are superb. So nice and helpful. It takes a few mins to walk to near by restaurants and 20-30 mins to market/shopping area. Not too close to market, but not too far.",Nat N,/Profile/natn541,"Bangkok, Thailand",40
ladakh,"Goba Guesthouse is conveniently located, and yet on the quieter part of town under the Shanti Stupa. Very relaxed vibe and helpful staff and owners. Basic accommodation with hot showers. The beautiful gardens and sprawling fields are a sight for sore eyes. Food options at the hotel are limited, but cafes and restaurants are a short walk away. Will definitely return to stay.",DivyaCD,/Profile/DivyaCD,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",40
ladakh,we liked the place. it is a bit spartan but the price is cheap. it is very quiet being outside town ( about 10 minutes walk from the centre). the family is very nice and helpful. if you ask they will help you driving you to town and/or to the airport.  the food is ok.,manuel,/Profile/116manuel,jerusalem,30

ladakh,"I stayed here to relax after my cycling trip, got to know about this place through friend. Amazingly silent and green, this place immediately stole my heart. The room was clean and I could see Stok Kangri through my window (no balcony). The rooms on opposite side had the view of Shanti Stupa with balcony.  The hosts were amazing people, old man the owner of property offered me apples from his farm too :) Would recommend it for people who want peaceful and green environment to chill out.",Satnam S,/Profile/SatnamS_11,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"We stayed here in mid-September when Leh was almost empty of tourists, but this place was pretty much alive - and for a reason: very nice surroundings, new and cosy house, warm family, good food . Really enjoyable stay, happy to recommend to everybody . They don't have an e-mail, as far as I know, but can be easily found: just near the trail leading to Shanti stupa. Enjoy!",Michael B,/Profile/michaelbF6830PE,"Haifa, Israel",50
ladakh,"This place is located at the top of Changspa Rd., with almost uninterrupted views across Leh valley to the peaks on the other side. They now have three stories so the views from the third floor are the best. Rates were Rs 600.- per room when we were there. The family went out of their way to help with any requests we had about local transport, or organising taxi drivers, etc. The meals (breakfast & dinner) also cooked in-house and were always very tasty and reasonably priced (Rs 75.- and Rs 100.-)  Highly recommended.",Poseiden,/Profile/Poseiden,Dortmund,50
