ladakh,"Amazing place to live at in Leh - I wished I never had to leave! The family lives on the ground floor, and the first floor is for guests. Some rooms have ensuite bathrooms, while others share a bathroom. The rooms are spacious, warm, comfortable (but a tad spartan) and extremely affordable. They have a pretty garden with chairs to lounge around in, and a cute little dog. The owner (his name escapes me) also owns a cyber cafe nearby and is extremely helpful. He sorted our stay in Merak (near Pangong) which was also other-worldly.",krist0ph3r,,"Belfast, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"I travelled in a group of 4 in august, we didn't had prior bookings. It was the last hotel of 4 that we checked for in the forte road - as aesthetically the hotel is not at all appealing. But the rooms were good, well maintained and airy. The toilets were super clean. Hot water was also available in the taps. All these for Rs 800 per room a night in a good season at Leh seemed very budget friendly.  But the highlight the hotel is host family, really eager to help. Once you will be there u will realize they are gem of persons.   We stayed there for first two days, then at the end of our Ladakh trip we again stayed there for a night before heading for our flight.  HIGHLY HIGHLY Recommened.",Shubham S,,,50
ladakh,"This was our home in Leh for the entire one week we were there! Mr. Dorjay and his family are the perfect hosts and their hospitality is amazing. The guest house is a hidden beauty, perfectly situated on the most happening place in Leh - Fort Road. The rooms are super clean and we were lucky to have a awesome ladakhi lunch with the family. I would highly recommend this guest house to anyone looking for a homely stay in Leh.",Ravleen K,,"Mumbai, India",50
