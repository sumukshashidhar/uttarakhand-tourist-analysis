Our room was large, ensuite, and tastefully decorated, spotlessly clean, and boasting  all facilities notably lacking in other guesthouses, ie towels, soap and toilet paper. The beds were firm and comfortable, and we had everything necessary to enjoy our stay. It was a wonderful place to return to after a challenging trek in the mountains! But the crowning glory of this excellent guesthouse was the food. Most produce was grown in the owners' extensive market garden,a nd we can still taste the delicious curd produced by the family cows.

ladakh,"We stayed here last year during our trip to Leh. The family is very friendly and helps you wherever they can. For breakfast you can choose between various food.
