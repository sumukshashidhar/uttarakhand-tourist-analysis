ladakh,Seven Seas is a very warm n homely stay option at leh. Priced reasonably super neat & clean . 6 mins walk from Leh main market. Strongly recommend all groups of friends traveling together. A lovely 12rooms property ideal from close groups . ,Mcroops,/Profile/Mcroops,"Mumbai (Bombay), India",40
ladakh,"We reached Leh as part of our one month tour of north India on 12th July 2018. My wife and I, senior citizens, wanted to visit Leh and Ladakh for some time. It was fulfilled last month (July,2018). Our original plan was to reach Chandigarh from Trivandrum where we were living and travel to Manali, and then to Leh. But when we read TripAdvisor forum posts about the sudden exposure to comparatively higher altitudes and the resultant AMS on the Manali-Leh road than the Srinagar-Leh road, we changed our plan. We reached Chandigarh on 4th July 2018 by Sampark Kranti at around 4 :30 pm. This train runs between Kochuveli(Trivandrum) and Chandigarh, weekly twice. We hired a Tuk-Tuk (simply called 'Auto' in Kerala) and arrived at YMCA, Sector 11 C Chandigarh. We had a room booked there",Babu Jacob,/Profile/babujacob,"Trivandrum, India",40
ladakh,"The outside is plain, without the usual Ladakhi woodwork to add charm. Rooms are comfortable. There’s a big construction going on opposite, which blocks most of the view. It’s a bit noisy during the day, but not an issue if you will be out and about all day. At Rs1200/day, it seems a bit expensive for what it is.",Peregrineri,/Profile/Peregrineri,"New Delhi, India",40
