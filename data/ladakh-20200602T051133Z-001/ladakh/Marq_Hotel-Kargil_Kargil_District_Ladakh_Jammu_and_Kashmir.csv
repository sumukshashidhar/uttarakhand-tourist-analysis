ladakh,After a really long journey from kargil to zanskar  We were looking for a room to accommodate two of us we went through all the hotels in zanskar the best we could find was THE MARQ.  The situation of the town was not really good the main transformer of the town was down and the whole town was experiencing a long cut of 12 hours a day but the hotel had it's own electricity generator which made our stay more comfortable the rooms were clean and spacious with a really beautiful view which could be seen across the window.  Hot running water is available 24x7. The hotel is looked by Mr aziz and his wife  Being in a really remote area the hotel has been maintained to it's peak  We were even give a discount for our stay  I would strongly recommend this hotel for everyone ✌️,Qunain A,/Profile/Qunain,,50
ladakh,We organize 4x4 Jeep safaris from Srinagar to Ladakh and Zanaskar  I myself lead the tours which usually include foreigners. Marq is the best place to stay in Zanaskar personal attention by owners always makes you feel special. Our clients always appreciate the service and quality of food provided. Nice and cozy rooms with panoramic views of the valley makes your stay a memorable one.,FaheeM11,/Profile/FaheeM11,"Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India",50
ladakh,I had stayed here with my wife & 2 kids in June 2015. We had a very comfortable stay. The owner Mr Aziz & his staff were very courteous & helpful. They did their best to make our stay very pleasant & unforgettable. Highly recommended.,Gurjeender,/Profile/Gurjeender,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
ladakh,"As if the drive from Kargil to Padum didnt had enough of us in Sep 2015, Marq Hotel was there to compliment the road....to take out the balance energy we had...Clumsy, untidy, full of spiders, hard rock beds, discourteous lady owner, obligation xpressed by giving us the rooms at 2600 even though was not worth a quarter. Food and behaviour of Owner couple left the experience sour at the beginning of 10 day journey....Not at all worth the stay.",RahulMJ,/Profile/RahulMJ,"New Delhi, India",10
ladakh,"Money minded owners, service were poor,  mis-management by the staff and pathetic food,   The hotel is run by a man named Aziz, but the command  is in the hand of his dominating wife. On the whole they  shattered the image of hospitality, the Zanskaris are known for.  The next day we saw rooms of another near by hotel by the name GAKYI,  and were taken aback by the warmth offered by the owner. The rooms were amazing, I wish I did not waste time at Hotel Marq or Hotel Ibex, the hostile couple runs",Umangjeet,/Profile/Umangjeet,"New Delhi, India",10
ladakh,I had my worst stay in the room provided by this hotel. We visited in 1st week of sept. and were a group of 40. We had done a combined booking. The owner sensing the group size initially gave us a discount but later on when he realized the group size wanted to make more money out of us. He accepted all our booking (more than he can accommodate in his hotel) and then provided us a very shabby lounge instead(Ibex hotel) to us. Ibex hotel had be closed and all the rooms were infested with spiders. When were allotted the room there were spider webs all around. We asked them to clean it and why our room wasnt cleaned....they said they didnt have time as they have cleaned the garden and cleaned the corridor area (some reply)... so garden area and corridor area is more important to,TravellingVipin,/Profile/TravellingVipin,"New Delhi, India",10
ladakh,"Stayed for two nights in sept 15 , strongly advise to travellers not to try this property if you really looking for good service , don't expect to get water bottle even on payment , bathroom can be use but without hot water . Food quality is pathetic . ",Pawan K,/Profile/599pawank,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",10
ladakh,"We went there this month only. We were around 40 pax in total, so we booked it earlier via phone. The owner Aziz bhai quoted a huge price and blessed us with 40% discount being in a large group. That discounted price was 2600/- per night!!! No its not any metro city hotel rate, its a rate in remote village of Zanskar Padum. We spent two nights in this hotel. The behavior of the owners is horrible, they were behaving like they are providing us the room at free of cost. I better not talk about the facilities this hotel will provide you(if any). Food was equally horrible, rooms are stinky and full of spiders and many unknown insects. The only good part was the welcome tea we got there after a tiresome journey from Kargil to Padum. Rest of the experiences are horrible. You have to",gkaustav,/Profile/gkaustav,"Noida, India",10
ladakh,"4000 Rs. per night (we paid Rs.2500 per night) in Padum at this hotel is not all worth it. The room charges include MAP and the Veg dinner served is not up to the mark.  On one of the days, the team requested for non-veg. After finishing the meal, the team members were surprised to note the bill. Rs. 350 for 2 pieces of mutton and Rs.250 for 2 pieces of chicken. Rs. 175 for 1 small piece of mutton. Beware of what you order.  Recommendation: Just avoid the place. The owners are used to looting foreigners (as they get paid in Dollars/Euros)",TheWallStands,/Profile/TheWallStands,"Ithaca, New York",10
ladakh,We noticed a Marq Hotel of Good standard but we offered stay at Hotel Ibex & Restaurant claimed equivalent to Mark Hotel which is incorrect in reality. If you consider Hotel Marq Grade A then Hotel Ibex is eligible for Grade C or lower. We charged rate of Hotel Marq for Hotel Ibex and food was not up to the mark of quality it is my / our experience based on truth. No. of Spiders staying free of cost with you. No Lights in the night 10.00 pm to 7.00 AM,Ajay Bhimani,/Profile/Ajay12968,"Rajkot, India",10
ladakh,"We spent 4 nights at the Marq hotel in Padum, Zanskar  and really enjoyed our long stay. Much to our surprise and delight, Marq hotel is a cosy and comfortable base to explore Zankari villages and Tibetan gompas (monasteries) in the surrounding areas of Padum. We stayed in room#101 on the first floor. The room is spacious, clean and full of natural lights and has spectacular views of the Himalayan mountain peaks. The bathroom is very clean. Shower has good pressure with plenty of solar panel heated hot water. The quality of towels is excellent. Most remarkably this hotels has Wifi in-room and worked well. The room has plenty of modern electrical outlets to charge camera batteries and devices. If you are on any kind of meal plan, you take your meals in the nearby hotel restaurant",Caroline D,/Profile/i_friti,"San Diego, California",50
