ladakh,The place is situated away from market crowd making it an excellent place to have an overnight stay. Owners are friendly and their food is goooood tooooo.... Best place to stay if you are coming  from or going to Leh.,Sarvesh B,/Profile/sarveshb53,"Amritsar, India",50

ladakh,Hotel in budget and with friendly staff . Me and my friends stayed on the top floor that was a suite with two rooms and a common room  . The view is so sothing to the eyes and the sound of the river water at night is too musical .,Mahboob A,/Profile/mahbooba19,,50
ladakh,"We were here recently but unfortunately due to the curfew in Kashmir, their business was really bad. We stayed here several nights and the room was really comfortable, clean, with tv, hot water and free wifi. It's right by the riverside on a quiet street and you hear the river while sleeping which is really nice. The staff is friendly and the rates are reasonable. Ask for the room on the topmost floor and you get the terrace to yourself. 15 minute walk to the main bazaar and streets.",Karen D,/Profile/H9181POkarend,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"Hotel was full. The one that hits you on the right side while coming from Srinagar side.  Hotel looked nice, but was running full. Asking rate was pretty much the norm in the city. On the main highway, so can be a bit noisy though. ",BunnyPunia,/Profile/BunnyPunia,"New Delhi, India",40
