ladakh,I stayed in the same tent where Shahrukh stayed during #JabtakjainJaan shoot :)   This place has got best view of Pangong from tents..the staff is amazing and food is good. It is about 10 mins walk to the Pangong lake. The tents are comfortable and have a attached bathroom.

ladakh,We loved the view from our camp. Although it was very cold at night but the rooms are well equiped with blankets and clean beds.  The only reaaon i would reccomed the camp is for the mesmerizing view you get from it.  Location is very good.   Staff were very cooperative and always ready to help you.  We enjoyed a lot and will surely choose the camp again for our next stay .,monalisa d,/Profile/Seaside387947,,50
ladakh,This is one of the colorful camps located on Pangong lake bank ffering a clean and comfortable stay. The staffs are very helpful and the common dining tent offer homely good vegetarian food. The rooms have thick mattress and blankets to keep you warm. Toilets are clean but it is advisable not to try and take shower as hot water might not be available in abundance. All rooms offer good view of the lake. The rooms are not equipped with charging points so the phones and other gadgets needs to be taken care in the main dining hall for charging. There is no power supply from 11pm to 6 am in the morning and tents have battery operated lamps to help. Each tent is supplied with 2 hot water bags in the night after dinner to keep the beds warm through the night as this area the temp. can,Priyanka S,/Profile/Pri0103,"Bambolim, India",40

ladakh,"Camp Whispering Waves was one of the best decisions in our Ladakh tour. The location of the camp facilitates Pangong view from all the tents. In-spite of infrastructural & geographical challenges in Spangmik, the team made us feel very homely & comfortable. Especially the hot-water bag post dinner, to stand the severe cold, was the cherry on the cake! The tents have basic amenities - clean washrooms and fresh linen are assured. The food was good. The staff was helpful. Overall, a great experience!",Makarand_Karve,/Profile/Makarand_Karve,,50
ladakh,"This camp is one of the oldest at Pangong Lake. It is wisely located at a distance from the lake, so as not to affect the immediate environment of the lake (unlike other camps), but with a splendid view of the lake from many of the rooms. The staff are always ready to serve hot water, tea, hot water bags, and even customized breakfast and dinner. Pangong Lake needs to be freed of tourists staying overnight, so that the pristine environment is protected. If tourists must stay, Whispering Waves is one of the better choices, rather than the camps dotting the lakeside.",Joyoti B,/Profile/1712JB12,"Kolkata, India",40
ladakh,"The camps are basic but the lake views are stunning from the camps...wake u and watch the sunrise and sip your cuppa while looking at the lake...where when the sunlight falls, the water shimmers and just gazing at it makes your morning worth every bit. The service is absolutely excellent. Considering how cold it is at Pangong, the staff doesn't fail to amaze you with their courtesy to never say no for anything. Not that I asked for any favours but whatever little like hot tea or hot water bags for the night, hot water buckets in the morning and everything else was taken care of. The food is as one of my friend said is soul food. made with love and served with love.

ladakh,One of the oldest camp site in Pangong. Our stay in said camp was good and memorable. Food was good. Place was also good. Stay only in middle tents - from no 9 to 13. Other new good options are also available so check before booking. Visit Pangong in mid July till Mid August.,Harshu,/Profile/harshhrz,"Ahmedabad, India",40
ladakh,"Good place though little bit further from lake Great hospitality good food excellent staff, Point to note, there is no power in tents after 10 PM To beat the the cold hot water bags are provided Mobile charging facility only in Dinning Tent  Most important , it is better to visit the lake before in the afternoon as it gets quite chilly late evening",Rajsek,/Profile/Rajsek,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,Accomodation and amenities for stay in Pangong are very basic. So do not have high hopes when you read that Jab Tak Hai Jaan crew stayed in this camp.  The lake is 10min away from the camp and it gets really chilly in the evenings.  Be sure to carry lots of warm clothing as there are no options of heater etc while staying in camps.,tsk2011,/Profile/tsk2011,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"The tents are quite well made, nice and cozy from inside. Even when its cold and windy outside, you are warm inside the tents. However the heavy winds makes the tent flutter a lot. They have an attached bathroom and if not asking for too much they do not have hot water in the tap, but they do provide it in a bucket separately. The food and the service is simplistic yet amazing, kudos for that.  The tents are slightly faraway from the lake, almost a 10 min walk but still gives a good lake view.  Actually its quite amazing how in such a faraway place they have managed to provide even this level of service. Living in these tents is an experience by itself.",SheetalSoni,/Profile/SheetalSoni,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"I have visited this place last year, and it was an awesome stay in Camp Whispering Waves.  Probably the best camp in Pangong . Though it is located little bit far away from the lake, but the view is awesome. Tents are well maintained, comfortable and clean. There is attached bath with the provision of hot and cold water.  Foods are really good and served hot. Overall very nice experience.",somsen,/Profile/somsen,"Kolkata, India",50
ladakh,It was a good stay and perhaps the best tents in Pangong but its away from the lake. It takes about 10 mins to walk up to the water. This is not a bad think because you are outside the clutter and it doesn't get as cold as it gets inside the other tents nearer to the water. The place could have been maintained better for the price we paid but then again its hard to access and bring supplies to this place. Overall a good experience. ,aki076,/Profile/akshaygehi,"Mumbai, India",40

ladakh,The people in this camp are extremely warm and caring in their approach. I was amazed at the variety of food served in the buffet during dinner and finger licking food.  Stayed with another friend couple in tents 11 and 12 on 22nd June 2017.  The tents are cozy with attached toilets. The best part it is little away from the lake so the breeze is lesser.  The people go the distance to take care of everybody. There was a group that reached the camp at 12:30 am as they had got stuck and the camp people had kept hot food ready for them.  Wishing all the staff at Camp Whispering Waves all the best.,ARICHAK,/Profile/ARICHAK,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,"We were 8 people and hence had bookings in 2 properties 4-4. I stayed in this one and soon other 4 came crying & horrified, disappointed by their property. The property as other in that region have tents ( camping) only but the make of tent and it's service totally separates it from the others . Nice put up tents with toilets attached and outside sit out partially covered which was very essential due to heavy winds always blowing . Also due to the location of the property situated little up hill from the lake , it makes your stay more comfortable, as the ones near the lake are always facing too much winds. A very little compromise on the view but nothing bothered when you're comfortable. Food provided at that level above sea in a remote area with limited electricity was awesome.",vicrathod_4,/Profile/vicrathod_4,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,It's one of the most toughest place to live. The weather is a challenge in itself added to it chilly winds that can pierce your bones. The tent is basic but that is the maximum possible at such places. Camp site is at a very good location and gives good view of the lake and the sorrounding mountains.

ladakh,"We stayed for one night at the camp. It offers excellent panoramic view of the lake. The tents are really strong, has comfy beds and also has a good bathroom. The food is quite good. The nights are really cold, but inside the tent, you would not feel it that much. You can sit outside the tent and stare at the milky way at midnight when lights go off. Its a short walking distance from the lake shore. In fact that is great in a way that you can have a wide panoramic view of the lake. SRK, Anushka Sharma and co stayed during their shooting schedule of Jab Tak Hai Jaan. However they have highly increased their rates recently due to all this hype. This is probably one of the costliest tents in Pangong. Since it was just for a night, we took the experience.",debankar,/Profile/debankar,"Kolkata, India",40

ladakh,Went with friends in Sept 16. Awesome tents. Nice food and great service. Some of the things to remember - they serve only veg food and it's the same with other tents in that area. But the food was good. - nights are too cold...around 3 degree during my stay. - electricity is available only for limited hours. - no phones work here. There is a satellite pay phone available just opposite this resort. - carry your own booze.  ,Varun Wadhwa,,Delhi,50
ladakh,"There are alot of camps on the bank of the lake but this is not one of them.  They are about 500 feet away from the lake which is actually an excellent thing.  There have been incidents where the tents on the bank due to the extremely crazy strong winds at night have blown people's tents of.  We faced the similar winds but our tents stood extremely strong.  Very spacious, excellent washrooms,  great service and amazing food.  No complaints at all.  Not very difficult to spot this place and a beautiful view to the lake.  They brought hot water in buckets for us in the morning which was very kind despite the difficult water situations there.  Very Happy with the stay and would highly recommend it ",pabal,,"Toronto, Canada",50
ladakh,"Since this was towards the end of our trip, we had already been in a lot of camps by then. This was average for the price we had paid. There were a lot of other camps with much better proximity to the lake. We had got deals through goibibo. This is the camp where sharukh khan and anushka supposedly stayed during jab tak he jaan shooting but the camp facilities did not live up to the hype.  The breakfast was good. So I would suggest look out for other options if available.",Aparna R,,"Bengaluru, India",30
ladakh,"Welcomed by tea and biscuits and later by a delicious dinner, this group of tents served as my base for the recent Pangong Tso exploration. A dozen staff members oversee these tents with utmost attention to detail.  Electricity is available only between 7 and 10 p.m., but this works rather well. A hot water bag is provided after dinner. The tents withstood the merciless winds with ease. The bucket of hot water provided in the morning was adequate for a quick shower. Considering the remoteness of the area, this is as luxurious as it can get for the price tag.  A ten minute walk down the slope will take you to the edge of the lake. There's no point in staying by the edge as it does get very windy and noisy at night.",Morningsider,,"Brisbane, Australia",50
ladakh,It was the most memorable stay in Pangong with the beautiful view of Pangong Lake one side & back side were mountains with melting ice. And what a moment it was full moon day and I had shoot the time-lapse video of the full moon from the camp. Day were warm and nights were chilly cold an excellent weather.

They have around 10 tents which are quite luxurious.   The staff is over courteous and will go out of their way to fulfil your needs, the food they serve is mind blowing and they also provide hot water bags to beat the cold.  The only negative or positive I do not know was the property is quite far from the actual lake shore, which given the temperatures we had to bear in the night times was actually a boon rather a bane :)",SundeepClive,/Profile/SundeepClive,"Bengaluru, India",50

The tents are unable to provide much protection from the biting cold in the night. There is no bon-fire or any other entertainment and the food is pathetic. Absolutely useless.,Manish672014,/Profile/Manish672014,"Kanpur, India",10

ladakh,"Very Nice tent property off the Pangong lake.... You may read the fact that this is a little far from the lake... However, with the kind of terrain and place Pangong is, you would better be a 5 minute hike away from the lake than stay in anything short of the security and convenience this place provides. Lets get to the pros and cons -  Pros 1. Solid tents, quite spacious, good bathrooms, Hot water in the mornings (you cant expect 24hrs hours really in Pangong!) 2. Friendly staff 3. A nice sit-out along with the tents to watch the lake from 4. Quite good food given the place you are in!   Cons 1. Just the 5 minute hike to the lake.... it tested the fitness out of us bed and couch potatoes! 2. This is more of a problem with tents... the whole night huge winds blew and though the",ranaditya,/Profile/ranaditya,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"The first thing that came to our mind during our entry to the premise is...away from the lake. There was no other complain one can make. Of course the expectation should be that of a remote camp and not of some luxurious apartment hotel. Nevertheless, lake can be seen from premise and is just 6 - 7 minute walk / 2 – 3 minute drive. Whispering Waves has the most neat, clean and spacious tents amongst those present around Pangong Lake – the best available in the locality. Even the Jab Tak Hai Jaan crew including SRK and AS stayed in this premise supports my opinion. Food was good in context to the camping location. Tent staff is also friendly and helpful. Hot water, medicines, etc. were easily available. They even claim to have oxygen cylinders for emergency, but touch-wood we",kotharidhimant,/Profile/kotharidhimant,Mumbai,40

ladakh,"The first thing you will notice is these colorful tents in Spangmik, Pangong. A group of 12-15 tents situated side by side, with lake facing tents and the mountains behind makes a wonderful ambiance. The lake is just around 100 meters from the tents. However you can have a good view of the lake even from your tents.  After a long and tiring journey, the staff welcomed us with hot tea/coffee. Very well maintained tents. Rooms were clean and tidy with hot water in toilet. Food served was very tasty and the friendly nature of the staff made our stay more enjoyable.

This place offers a great location for taking time lapse photography with views of both lakes and mountains.

ladakh,"We visited this camp on 6th May. It was just the start of the season and the weather was very chilly and windy when we reached the camp after 5 hrs of long journey and a long wating time at Karu. Immediately after reaching they gave us hot Tea and Cofee withs lots of biscuits which warmed us up and we really felt charged up. The dinner and Breakfast, though limited in variety was tasty. The tents were clean and nice. Each tent has direct and clear view of the serene and beatiful Pangong Lake. The night stay and the long travel was worth the every bit of it.  Tips -  1. Many Tourist guides and Taxi drivers suggest to make a day trip to Pangong. But I would highly recommend to have atleast one night stay at Pangong  as that way you can enjoy the ever changing colors of Pangong",Bhavana A,/Profile/BhavanaMumbai,Mumbai,50

ladakh,We had a great camping experience at Whispering Waves. The tents are well appointed and offer great views of Pangong Tso. Food was good and the service too was in line with expectations. They provide hot water bags if its cold in the night. It is worth staying in this camp on a visit to Pangong. The nearest good point on the lake is about 2 kms away but the distance is same from all other camps so its not a minus for Whispering Waves.,Amit,/Profile/AmitLahoti,"Mumbai, India",50

However, it was at a good location along the banks of the lake (within 100m) on the top of a hill. The view was great from the camps. We witnesses moon rise as well as sun rise. Staff was courteous and helpful. Food was awesome. Heard that Jab Tak Hai Jaan actors (SRK and Anushka) stayed at this place. Highly recommended.

The tents are fairly well appointed and modern and provide reasonable protection from the winds and cold.  They certainly seemed more sturdy than some of the other camps in the region.  The staff at the camp is also very helpful and courteous; it is clear that they have been trained well to be responsive to customers. They were quite helpful when we asked for some rearrangements within the tent, and were also pleasant folk to talk to over a hot cup of tea.

In Spangmik village, Whispering Waves is a splash of colour against the barren and overpowering mountains. The camp has attractive and bright orange and blue coloured tents which were visible from a distance. It is a few kilometers away from Shooting Point and the other camps, dhabas and restaurants.

We can see the lake & its beauty from the camp site itself with mild whispers of the water from LAKE. Service is good & staff are very co-operative. Tents are spacious & clean. Food has a very limited option as all the supplies are dependent on LEH market & hence we have to eat what is available rather than of your choice.,AkkshayJain,/Profile/AkkshayJain,"Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,"Camp Whispering waves is undoubtedly best when it comes to staying in clean tents, with attached toilets, running water (hot on demand), hygeinic and very good food served in a dedicated dining area. It gives you a great view of lake from the tents. The only negative part is it takes a 10 minutes walk from the tents to reach the lake. There are other tents which are right on the bank of the lake. However I didn't find it negative looking at the condition of other tents ( hygiene and quality). During overnight stay in pangong, the wind blows fiercely during night and you would never want to stay in tents which are nearest to the lake but  no strong enough to take the blow of the wind.

However, the staff is a little stiff with a bit of attitude and need better customer communication training.

Since I did not stay there, I cannot state anything about the quality of tents/food etc.  In my opinion, one undertakes the 6-7 hour journey to visit Pangong Tso lake for experiencing the lake and the cool blue waters. This camp is the located farthest from the lake and the lake is not easily accessible for a leisurely evening walk. The camp itself looks colorful and pretty, but that's the least important reason for me.
