ladakh,"The guest house is very neat, clean, peaceful & lovely and is run by a Ladakhi couple. The owners are educated, very caring, cool, humble, friendly & helpful. This is a peaceful and tranquil abode best for small families and elderly couples or anyone who is looking for a break from the noisy world.  This is a very economical and decent place to stay. Someone is always there to tend to your needs and serve hot and fresh food, just like home. They offer a wide range of vegetable dishes. They provide comfortable neat beddings, very clean blankets and pillows. The view is very pleasant from the big windows of the guest rooms. Rubber slippers are provided by the guest house itself to wear inside the house. Parking space is there for guests. It felt like we were so many miles away",Indranil R,/Profile/iroyburman,"Noida, India",50
ladakh,"Quiet place not too far from the center, the family is lovely and always helpful, perfect hosts. I really enjoyed to stay with them. The room was nice and clean with a lovely balcony and great view. Dinner is always Indian food - if you need a change go for the restaurants in the city center! I really recommend to stay with that nice family!",Dagmar W,/Profile/579dagmarw,,50
ladakh,"Firstly,  when travelling to Leh,  don't book online. Its 200 to 500rs cheaper if u directly book with them. Rest as in official description,  its exactly the same.  The owner and staff are very helpful..",Mihirjs,/Profile/Mihirjs,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"When you first drive, you wonder whether this place is. You keep going and going.   Once you get there it gets amazing. First thing that U see - large parking space. Then the room - it is a bit underwhelming and needs refurbishing.   But everything else is fantastic. The dinner and breakfast are phenomenal. And the best thing of the place - the hosts. Dorjay and his family are phenomenal. They are so helpful - places to visit and what time to lean etc.   When our car broke down, his team got under the car and fixed it temporarily  We came back 3 times during our stay and if we are ever here, we'd love to be back.

ladakh,"I was looking for a welcoming and quiet place - an I got it at Lehling Guesthouse. My room was at the first floor with a great view and a balcony, just great. It was clean and spacious and at a reasonable price. The owners, Mr Dorjee and Mrs Kunzang, were lovely and helpful, perfect hosts. They provide food on demand and whenever I had it dinner was delicious. As for breakfast there was not much of a variety, so perhaps it's a good idea to order it beforehand or eat out.  I had a wonderful stay and I will definitely come back.",Dagmar W,/Profile/579dagmarw,,50
ladakh,"I ended up booking this place after a very good review from a friend. And after being here, I have already recommended this place to couple of groups. We visited this place (a group of friends, with 2 couples) in June end this year. The guest house is located a little far from market area, but that also makes it a quiet and pleasant place with beautiful view of mountains. And distance from market may not be a consideration factor in most cases, specifically if you would have vehicles booked for your entire period of stay. Mr. Tsewang, owner of the guest house was a phone call away to guide us to the place, once we entered Leh. The rooms were neatly maintained, washrooms were clean. The hotel staff cooked really delicious home food for us, that too served in a nice dining place. ",AbhayHora,/Profile/AbhayHora,"Hyderabad, India",40
ladakh,"After lot of research on the net we landed here. We stayed here for 5 days.   The rooms were huge with excellent mountain views. The owners Mr Dorjee and Mrs Kunzang were excellent hosts. We were there in early May and the Srinagar highway hadnt opened yet and hence supplies were limited. But they made sure we never had any issues with the food. They never refused anything.  They cooked delicious meals for us during our stay, guided us for local travel, even took one of our co travellers to the hospital in his own car at 1am as she sufferred from AMS.  If I ever revisit Ladakh i know where to stay.  The only drawback is the location. Its a little far off from the market, but the distance has its own advantage - you can almost here a pin drop at night.",avips_007,/Profile/avips_007,"Hyderabad, India",40
ladakh,"me and my friend wanted a really quiet place to stay in Leh. So we found LehLing guest house through the net. we did a rough check for the place from tripadvisor and also their website(do check their website it really nice). The owner is a really nice person and offered us double bedroom suite for a reasonable price. The view from our bedroom was awesome you could just see the lovely mountains when you are awake,i have uploaded the 2 photos check it out. The service is good and also the bathroom and toilet are clean. The food was good and different and served in the Wonderful living room. overall nice place to stay only little far from town but we liked it since it was quiet and pleasant. :)",Keshav M,/Profile/567keshavm,,40
ladakh,"It was a year long plan for us to visit Ladakh and we ensured that pre-booking is done for us for our rooms at Leh-Ling Guest House. Once we arrived at Leh Airport we hired a taxi which dropped us till the guest house. The hotel is located a little far from the market area which is very peaceful but not a walking distance. You have to ensure that you have proper to-fro transportation.  We were welcomed by the hosts, Mr. Dorji & Mrs. Kunzang who have us a warm smile and guided us to our rooms at the first floor. We made our room choices and ensured that things are at place. We were offered a welcome tea to acclimatize us with the sudden change in climate/temperature. We were extremely happy with the room conditions and since we were the only guests present, we had the liberty to",bongfooodie,/Profile/bongfooodie,"Kolkata, India",40
ladakh,"Our stay at Lehling was cosy and absolutely delightful. We really liked the owner, his family and especially their humble house keeper, Krishna. At our arrival, we were welcomed with a complementary  mint tea in the family living room/ common area. In the evenings, the family gathers here to have dinner and they welcome visitors to join them. We enjoyed the ladakhi style family atmosphere and having chats with the owner, Dorje. He was helpful and always cheerful.   Rooms are basic but very clean and most importantly the solar powered showers kept us warm in the autumn month. Good value for the off season discount price we got (700 idr) and definitely worth the small hike uphill from the main bit of town.  Wifi is accessible when there are no power shortages, but power cuts are",mojofriedrice,/Profile/mojofriedrice,,40
