ladakh,"When you go to a place like Ladakh (Leh), apart form Luxuries and comfort and good hotel- you also need something else called local feel, being able to enjoy the local fauna, air, view and local essence. From the moment you step into their Gate, the property is well laid out in the way that you experience something called- out of the world feeling.  Needless to repeat the service, food quality, hospitality, and standard of service which have been reiterated by almost every reviewers ...  I have seen most of the properties of all categories and this property is the best in it;s class and certainly more value than what you may be paying for...  It may be that staying for a longer duration may not be economically suitable for some, but I would recommend staying at-least a day here",Indiabyroad,/Profile/Indiabyroad,,50

On reaching the premises, I found the staff to be very polite and welcoming. The accessibility to the hotel is great as it is simply a short drive away from the market. The rooms were tidy and well maintained. It was hard to not be mesmerised by the picturesque location which provided amazing, scenic views of the majestic Himalayas.

ladakh,"This hotel is a perfect way to ruin your holiday for the price range it is in. If you're someone who lives in star hotels you will be shocked with how bad the service can get. To put things into perspective, if you ask them to clean the room, don't expect toiletries, towels to be changed. The food too is pathetic and breakfast is a sham. Finally, you would have to walk a kilometre to get to the hotel in a totally broken road.   Half the property is broken for renovation and it has no recreation facilities although their websites and listings don't reflect this.  The staff has no training and no idea of what hospitality is.

This place is well-located for people wanting to explore the rest of the city and do some shopping - all the marketplaces and nice resaurants are within easy reach. Interesting fact..it boasts of the world's highest swiming pool which is a feat in itself given the remotenesss of the city up in the himalayas.

Serious lack of communications between them and the driver  - Things in the room were broken and they just couldn’t fix it  - Extremely callous attitude of the management when these things were highlighted.

ladakh,"The hotel is relatively new and our first impressions were very good. We had booked through a travel agency: Overland express. we were to be provided with 2 premium rooms. On the first day we were given two cottages, these have very little privacy you cannot even open the windows and they do not have any fans!! The windows all open on to open corridors or lawns hence no privacy. the size of the room was good. The next time we checked in we were once again given 2 different cottages, in one cottage you had to use the EWC with an open umbrella as water was leaking profusely from the roof. Though they claimed it had been fixed the situation remained the same till we checked out the next day. On our third check in we were in for a surprise we were given room no. 201 & 202 and not",Shashank51,/Profile/Shashank51,"Noida, India",20

ladakh,"My husband and me visited leh few days back. We were booked by our travel agent into ""the Zen resorts"" in highest category. The hotel looked fine but very soon we realised the inefficiency of the staff and the poor service. However since we had prepaid for the trip and were determined not to spoil our trip we stayed on. We were promised a presidential suite for 30th for which we have a written confirmation. Suspecting a goof up on the part of staff when on 29th we left for  Nubra, I reminded them. When I reached on 30th I was shocked. Not only the room was given to someone else, they are abusive and rude. Mostly the top management was shouting and abusive. I will never ever recommend this place  ""the Zen resorts"" leh to anyone. They are a bunch of idiots.  And rudeness of",Goelcutis,/Profile/Goelcutis,Mumbai ,10

ladakh,"I stayed at the Zen in early May and I must say the staff there goes beyond the call of duty to make you comfortable. I suffered from high altitude sickness during my stay and had to be hospitalized. The staff not only came along with me to the hospital, but also provided food and made all arrangements for everything needed during the hospital stay. The hotel rooms are very spacious and elegant. Bathroom floor is heated, which is a nice feature. Food was excellent too. I cannot thank the staff enough for being so helpful. Would highly recommend this hotel.",Travel_Qu0tes,/Profile/Travel_Qu0tes,"Mumbai, India",50

ladakh,"We stayed here at this property from 15th-20th April and it was simply fantastic. Let me review each and every place of this hotel:  1) Bedroom: Super luxurious and triple the size of any normal room in Leh. Its heated (well thats called luxury in Leh). The floor is wooden. The view is of ice capped mountains. Simply superb!  2) Bathrooms: The floor is heated. We were so amazed to see that! Luxurious tub! Wow!  3) Restaurant: Warm, cozy and the best food in Leh. Try their Aaloo-Puri in breakfast and Kashmiri Dum-Aaloo in dinner. Simply amazing food. Indian and Chinese food is great! Every one visiting this place must have their food.  4) Swimming pool and Spa: The only hotel in Leh which has a swimming pool. We did not use the pool though but it looked superb with indoor",Linenwalas,/Profile/Linenwalas,"Jaipur, India",50

The staff starting from the booking/sales (Was booked directly), reception, room service, restaurant was very helpful and always greeting with a smile. The property is brand new, sprawling and with great views. I will definately love to come back some time again.",krish22,/Profile/krish22,"Kolkata, India",50
