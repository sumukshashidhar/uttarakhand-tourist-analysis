ladakh,"We came to Greenvilla on somebody's recommendation and loved every moment. It is a nice little cosy quaint guesthouse which exudes warm hospitality. It is a family run enterprise and one can feel the warmth of home.The rooms are of decent size and the view from the rooms are amazing. The rooms are simple, clean and with basic amenities. There is a lovely terrace where you can sit under the starlit night sky. The food is home cooked, fresh and delicious, the vegetables come straight from the garden. The hosts are very helpful, the communication was prompt and effective. They provided valuable tips to make our visit to Leh worthwhile. We highly recommend this place for a lovely stay in Leh.",jpgayan,/Profile/jpgayan,"Doha, Qatar",50
ladakh,"We stayed overall 8 nights at Green villa as part of a long Ladakh itinerary.  Green villa is located just 10 minutes walk from the main market - excellent location away from the noise and traffic, while easy to get to the town centre for shops and restaurants. Green villa is a small guesthouse (~10 rooms) surrounded by a lovely garden where they grow many vegetables and plenty of flowering plants too! The hosts are super friendly and helpful accommodating our various requests! The kitchen cum traditional dining room is lovely where delicious home cooked dinner is served with fresh garden vegetables, roti, dal and rice or ladakhi cuisine such as momo and skiu. The breakfast was composed of toasts, alu paratha and homemade apricot jam to die for, and some fruits. The rooms are on",Milou V,/Profile/TintinM_12,Singapore,50
ladakh,"We recently visited Leh and surrounding areas and chose to stay here . Initially stayed here for 2 days and then for one more additional day on our return journey. Rinchen was super accommodating esp considering the fact that our plan kept on changing and we checked in pretty late both times. The food here is Amazing!! were regret not eating here the first 2days . We were a total of 6 people including 2 teenagers.we felt safe and comfortable here:) Would I stay here again- at the drop of a hat!! highly recommended. The only issue we faced was the noise created by a few bikers who were staying on the same floor,which was also sorted once we requested them to lower their volume.

ladakh,"We were a group of three ladies from Thailand. We stayed in Green Villa Guest House in July,2018. The place, you feel home. It is small guest house but that is enough. The manager was very kind. We arrived late afternoon which is time to take a rest. We were hungry so he told the staffs to cook for us even it is not lunch or dinner time. The manger family were so friendly and helpful. The staffs were friendly and helpful too. We were happy in this place. The only problem is internet connection but I believe it is not the problem only in this place. I think it is all around Leh. Thank you from Thailand.

ladakh,"Our family with 2 teens stayed at Green Villa for 11 nights.  This was longer than expected as we experienced a health problem.   1- The food was fabulous - it was a shared communal dining experience eating the same food that the family ate later that night - using produce from their beautiful garden.   2 - The owners gave us great tips about what to do in the local and extended area. 3 - The rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable with lovely light and often views to their wonderful garden. 4 - Richen and the staff at Green Villa were incredibly generous and helpful to us during our extended stay. We played cricket with the kids in the yard, read our books in the garden and enjoyed the hospitality of the family.  The meals and accomodation was affordable and a great price.

ladakh,Superb experience staying with bunch of people who own this hotel. They give you homely treatment and ensure that you don't face any issue whatsoever.   We stayed three days in hotel / house and never bothered complaining about anything as everything was as per expectation.  It all started with warm welcome by the family. We were asked to have dinner in a common kitchen like dine in area with other travelers. That was the best time to spend with as we could interact with other travelers. Food provided was self made by hotel owner and awesome. The veggies used also were grown in the field of hotel owner.  It has everything a homestay needs to have.. Enjoy and Have fun :)  Dont forget to eat VEGGI MOMOs made by Rinchen!,Vinayak Manglurkar,/Profile/vinayakmanglurkar,"Pune, India",40
ladakh,"Yes, this is how exactly we felt during our stay at Green Villa ""Home away from Home"". The host and his family was so so accommodating, I dont think our trip would have gone so easy and smooth if we hadn't stayed at the Green Villa in Leh. We were a group of 10 people and had the most comfortable stay at this place. The home cooked meals, hot aromatic food along with beverages, they made sure we were spoilt and met all our expectations. One must definitely stay here to feel what we all felt at the same time. One of our most memorable stays till now. Also, in case you can, look out for a doll named Zumsal at this stay :)",jinal b,/Profile/jinalb8166,,50

ladakh,"I don't know where to begin from. At the Green Villa i met the nicest people ever. My trip to Leh was an eventful one. On the day I reached Leh I was struck by AMS. Things got quickly out of hand and before I could realize I was at the SNM Hospital. I had to spend 3 days there. During that time the owners of Green Villa quite literally took my the role of my guardians. From getting me home cooked food to taking care of my needs they did it all. Ammu ( owner), Dorji (the husband), Ammu's parents...they all took turns to take care of me. Back from the hospital,  the guest house gave me a warm feeling of being at home. All the rooms have huge beds, clean toilets, spacious cupboards and spectacular views. You get delicious food here as well.

When we returned to Leh from Nubra, we looked out for this place and even though none of us including the driver knew the location, luckily found it!   It's a lovely property with cozy rooms, surrounded by a vegetable farm. There's a bunch of big lillies, poppies, sunflowers in the garden, in case you like some floral camera shots.  The owner lady is very welcoming. Food is great, including breakfast. Sleep quality is good. They have help but I see all of the family members putting effort and interest in the convinience of the guests.   While leaving I forgot my phone back at the homestay.

Welcome was warm, food natural, all home grown and delicious.  The first few days we acclimatised to the altitude before going trekking and then came back again to rest before leaving. We felt like part of the family and were truly sad to leave. We will go back there if we get another chance to visit Leh.",me48,/Profile/me48,"Bali, Indonesia",50
