ladakh,"I was on my solo trip to Leh when I visited Raybo hostel. The staff were very friendly and their primary concern was comfort,they did not even care about payment as my net was not working good so they told me to get setteled first and then pay on next day. I even got two night free of cost stay on an offer. On my last night they organised a good party with bonfire and we enjoyed a lot. All the efforts were made by Samarika Issar, the caretaker of Raybo hostel. That was amazing experience over there. Thanks Raybo",Anoop Sinha,/Profile/anoopadvlover,,50
ladakh,I visited Leh in May 2018 along with 4 friends. There's plenty of parking space in front of the hostel. The services offered were really great. The owner Mr Eshay is professional and polite. The rooms and beds were more than comfortable. The hostel was almost fully occupied and there were plenty of foreigners staying there with us so we had great conversations. The food offered in the kitchen was also good and it was not expensive at all. Raybo Hostel is definitely better than Lavie Hostel. Highly recommended for travellers who don't want to stay in the rooms and just explore!,Eshaan S,/Profile/EshaanS3,,50

Carrot, broccoli and wheat farm in the vicinity makes it a perfect location to stay, all this cannot end without the touch of Shiva (do ask for him) honest man!

Raybo has a common room providing you the oppurtunity to interact rather sticking to ur room, share ur stories, learn theirs, play games, chill out with books and gaming as well.  A very warm staff not hesitating to help at anytime of the day. Clean linen beds and an awesome breakfast what else would u wish for a goodnight sleep.   I bet you wouldnt find any place with such a reasonable price to provide such a great experience in leh.  Cheers! ",Sharath Y,/Profile/sharathy2016,,50
ladakh,"If you are someone who like travelling and would want to stay at a place where you'll get to meet travelers from different parts of the world, have conversations with strangers who share same passion for travel as you do, sleep on bunk beds, play games, then this is for you. Raybo Hostel is the only one of its kind in Leh. Price per bed is very reasonable. Very tidy environment. Well designed aesthetics. Common area was huge for people to chill out with TV and some books to read. Excellent service. Breakfast was delicious on all the days ( we were 3 friends, stayed for 4 days). Overall it was a great experience. I would definitely recommend this place if you are visiting Leh.  Special mention - There is play station in the hostel with all the games loaded ( FIFA, COD, Hitman",Rahul R,/Profile/RahulR3110,,50
ladakh,I was fortunate enough to be the very first guest  at Raybo. It was a wonderful staying experience with the inmates there and the hospitality and friendly behaviour of Eshay and  raybo team will make you feel like you are at your friends place. I strongly suggest this place to people who are travelling solo or in group or couples.  Definitely the best hostel in Leh. The mos important you get good breakfast and WIFI here.  Cheers!! Enjoy travelling and exploring yourself.,prashant j,/Profile/prashantj426,,50
ladakh,"After a 20hr bus ride from Manali, we arrived at Raybo at midnight thanks to a kind couple who gave us a ride from the bus station. We were expecting our pre-booked private room and hot bath. When we arrived, the host, Rakesh (I believe) said the hostel was full and offered that we sleep in the common area between all the rooms, although he didn't have clean sheets to give us. He had given our booking to someone else.   Two guests noticed and offered to sleep there themselves and insisted we take their beds in the dorm room since they were leaving to the airport in a few hours. With much hesitation, we took them up on their offer. The next morning, the host didn't even offer free breakfast and wanted to charge us for the beds in the dorm. So he basically wanted to charge us AND",mariaclaraf2790,/Profile/mariaclaraf2790,,10
