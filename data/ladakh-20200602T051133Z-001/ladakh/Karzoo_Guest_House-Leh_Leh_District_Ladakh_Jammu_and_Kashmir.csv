ladakh,12日間滞在しました。シャワートイレは共用でしたが、安くてスタッフがフレンドリーだったので非常に良かったです。ゲートの近くの水場で洗濯をして、屋上に干したのも楽しい思い出です。,Tomkhuu,/Profile/Tomkhuu,"Ulaanbaatar, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",40
ladakh,"The rooms were too small and dingy and the bathrooms very average. They have two blocks, the new block, in which rooms have attached bathrooms and the old block, where there are rooms, with shared or common bathrooms. The attached-rooms were too small for two people and hardly any place to move around if you place your luggage. The old block rooms were spacious and bathroom fairly clean. However, the lighting is very poor. The attached rooms cost us 600/- and the common ones, 300/- a day. Don't expect advance reservation, rooms are subject to that day's availability. The person manning the hotel was very friendly and warm, and that was a pleasant experience.",Vinod,/Profile/ramansvinu,Bangalore,30
ladakh,"Reaching mulbeik at 9 pm, we were glad to find accommodation at Karzoo. We were pleasantly surprised with the warmth and the hospitality of the family. Room rates are extremely reasonable and the food is really nice. The guesthouse, rooms and wash rooms were very clean. The fact that they do not have rooms with attached washrooms could be a deterrent (but the room and the washroom was clean indeed).   This place is situated right near the entry of mulbeik (Mr. Dhadul Namgial 9419880463)  This place would be deal for budget travelers.",chintan24681,/Profile/chintan24681,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"Das Karzoo Guest House bietet sehr einfach eingerichtete, aber halbwegs saubere Zimmer. Die Preise für ein Doppelzimmer mit Gemeinschaftsbad, welches mehrfach täglich gereinigt wird, liegen so um die 400 INR. Zu erwähnen ist noch der nette Eigentümer/Angestellter, der immer für Fragen und Tipps zur Verfügung steht. Auch der kleine Garten im Innenhof, mit ein paar Tischen; macht einen netten Eindruck.",Nexus71,/Profile/Nexus71,"Osnabrück, Germany",30
