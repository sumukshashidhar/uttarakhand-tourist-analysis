ladakh,We were a group of 10 people who got this property through Yatra. The rooms are neat and property is good but there is no access road to this place. It's a mud trail where hardly a vehicle could go. We almost missed our flight as the cabs didn't know how to reach there. Even the staff was unaware about the nearby landmarks where cabs were waiting. We had to carry our luggage and walk all the way to the nearest accessible road.,Shivam Gupta,/Profile/shivamorai,,10
ladakh,"The rooms are clean and so are the bathrooms. But the approach roads are dug up, hence one has to walk for 4-5 minutes to reach the hotel. Hot water is available only in the bath taps and not in the basin tap. There is no room heater and we had to request our tour operator to lend us one. The cooks and staff are helpful and cooperative but better to ask for any extra charges upfront, since they asked us for extra money for the 5 or 6 cups of tea that we had consumed in the afternoons. Most important, the blankets is suspected of having nits- we had bites on our legs! Maybe the owner Mr Ashok should insist on keeping the blankets in the sunlight at the beginning of each season.",praveendiscovery29,/Profile/praveendiscovery29,"Mumbai, India",40

ladakh,"We stayed at this hotel in 2015 when this was relatively new. The staff was friendly, courteous and always ready to help. They are a part of the reason why the Ladakh trip became memorable with their welcoming and happy nature. The rooms and bathrooms are spacious and clean. The views from the room are beautiful. This is away from the hubub of the town but is at a walkable distance. Overall an enjoyable and pleasant stay.  Note : most of the hotels in Leh are average unless you opt to go for the super luxury places. Wifi is intermittent everywhere and this is a problem throughout and not confined to this hotel.",Neena P,/Profile/28neenap,Michigan,50
ladakh,"Travel with 3 family member 20-24 Sep 2017 Large courtyard with various flower bed combine with grand mountain making majestic scenery Room are clean, spacious and has classic feel The best thing here are service, staffs are enthustic, cab driver aviable to bring you to market (10-15 min), or accompany your walking (5-7 min) Original india food here is significant better than in the market. However, I am Thai, non-vegetarian who use to eat very strong taste and spicy food. I have a hard time with food in other place in Leh-Pangong Thank to chef in the hotel. They can make modified india food, europian food and also pack the food for you to bring elsewhere, without additional charge. Hot water in every hotel in Leh is available only for a short time. Staff also bring you large",Teerawat P,/Profile/TeerawatP43,,50

ladakh,"We were a group of 17 members who checked into Classic Ladakh on 13th Aug'17. The rooms are highly spacious, the Manager and members taking care of the hotel were extremely welcoming and became friends by the time we finished our stay.  We stayed there for 3 days and it was totally worth it. Upon special request we were served breakfast by early morning. If you are at Leh then definitely worth a stay. Highly recommended - Team Keep Trippin",Vikram Kasi,/Profile/KeepTrippin_in,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,"At Hotel Classic Ladakh you will find more than a hotel manager: you will find a friend. Mr. Ashok goes to great lengths to make your stay comfortable and pleasant, helped by a great team. Rooms are spacious, with a wonderful view on the mountains. The food served at the restaurant is also very tasty: we had some of the best momos in town!  We wish we could have stayed longer, and cannot thank Mr. Ashok enough for all the help he has given us. Wishing him all the best, Giuseppe",Serendipi T,/Profile/serendipit2017,,50
ladakh,"The Property is located at safe distance from Leh Market area, amid the beauty of Nature . The Hotel staff is hospitable although not much professional, but somehow they were ready to help you. Rooms  amenities are standard accompanied by cleanliness, complete with loads of Wooden Work that can gives you feel of Leh. Hotel is accompanied with lot of Open Space ideal for Panoramic view of the place with clear sight of Shanti Stupa, popular tourist place of Leh-Ladakh. The best part of our stay was delicious Home Cooked Food. Chef was prompt in making dishes according to the wish of the Guests.   This place is good to stay if you looking for Budget Hotel amid peace of nature.",Prateek R,/Profile/PrateekR113,"Cairo, Egypt",40

ladakh,"We five couples stayed at Hotel Classic Ladakh Leh for three days in July 2017. Mr Ashok welcomed us and we were given a welcome drink. Right from our arrival till our departure we were treated as royalty. All meals provided were just like our home cooked food. The cook and other staff would ask us before hand as to what we would like to have and they would prepare it and serve it. They have 10 rooms, very spacious. Very well maintained. The staff most cooperative. They would pack up food for us too for our onward journey  too. Really thankful to the entire staff for a most wonderful experience.

ladakh,This hotels service is very bad The manager is very unprofessional.had asked for an extra bed which was refused as we were late Has a curfew order that nobody can come after 11 pm Location is very far from main market The manger instead of resolving problems argues with you Overall a very bad experience ,Tourist154065,/Profile/Tourist154065,,10
ladakh,I stated here for 4 days and my experience was amazing. It's a beautiful boutique hotel. Rooms & bathrooms are quite spacious. They have a balcony attached to every room. All rooms have TV. Hot water is available only in the morning (but that's with all hotels in leh). Views from rooms are not that mind blowing on ground level as there is a lot of bare land & construction happening around but you can view mountains & shanti stupa from a few rooms but I won't give full marks to the views. The hotel staff is very friendly and will do their best for you. The market is around 15 mins drive but if you can walk then there's a short cut lane that goes from the hotel which does not take more than 5-7 mins and I must say that the walk is nice.  Now my biggest reason to rate them best is,Ruchhii2509,/Profile/Ruchhii2509,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"pros :-  Me and I my 2 friends had stayed in Hotel Classic Ladakh during 1 week of May.  It is an awesome place to stay. Mountains views, Shanti stupa view you will get from your room. Food is amazing, simply delicious.  Rooms and bathroom are very clean and perfect as expected The owner of  Hotel Classic Ladakh is very helpful. They have provided us extra privileges which we can't expect from any other hotel owner. The staff is also very friendly and helpful.  cons :- We have faced one issue with car in a first journey during leh to nubra which we have asked to change for our next trip (owner of this hotel has provided us another car for next trip ) The hotel has wifi but there is Lil issue with range in room sometimes.  If you sum up the stay in Hotel Classic Ladakh is worth",Shubham J,/Profile/ShubhamJ406,,50
