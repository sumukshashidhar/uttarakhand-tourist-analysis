ladakh,"Leh - heart warming place which has captured beauty in his arms. Nature Residency leh is a true gem which shares its part in the art of nature. Beautiful gardens, infrastructure, sitting arrangements front the rivers, Himalayas views all over surrounding and birds chirping all over. What a moment's I have captured here. Truely appreciated. I had taken the Family SUITE which where India River and Himalayas Facing. Big curtains, a cup of coffee with a view, wooden interiors, and the bathtub- Heaven there.",Heta Shah,/Profile/sweetu19,,50
ladakh,Can I rate it more than five? The wonder of the lake is the no. of colors that are possible to see in the water. It has different colors at different times of the day. To reach here you have to pass Changla pass ( third highest pass in the world) by driving 5-6 hours. You can stay in tents. The beauty you will feel is beyond words and description. All I would say are must-see places before you die.,Tejas Joshi,/Profile/Tejas3895,,50

Mr.Stanzin is incredibly helpful and generous with his time and advice throughout the stay. We were a group of 11 with constantly changing plans, they were very accommodative to our requests and made us feel at home.   The restaurant at the hotel was great.

You won't regret, just be there:)  Thanks for making our visit to Ladakh that much better.",Ajay,/Profile/anillusion_itis,,50
ladakh,"I stayed at this property for the last 2 days of my trip to leh-ladakh. I booked myself a superior deluxe room with river view and trust me it was no less than a blissful experience. Waking up to watching mighty himalayas and to sound of running Indus river was an experience in itself. Staff was very helpful in attending all my needs as I had lost my phone charger during the trip and they were able to lend me one. wifi was only available in common area (which is pretty much the same case with every property in leh-ladakh). Only disappointing factor is if you are travelling solo or as  a couple, you will be dependent on cab(which cost 650) for a trip to even leh market. All in all a fabulous stay.",snehadevadiga14,/Profile/snehadevadiga14,"Mumbai, India",40

ladakh,This hotel is quite good enough for their service and the way they behave with their customers. The one of the specialty of this hotel is well maintained structure and easy reach from airport.

ladakh,"When we were being transported to the hotel from the airport, we realised that the property is located quite out of the city. We had booked the package of 6 nights through a local travel agent & first three days were to be spent at this hotel property.One advantage of staying here was that the Pangong & Tsomoriri lake are closer to this hotel,cutting down travel time to these places by app. 30 minutes.The view of the surroundings hills from the hotel rooms/rooftop is quite good & different.The hotel is located on the bank of a small tributary of Indus River & they have provision of small boats also which the guests are allowed to use for some fun.  The hotel is reasonably clean with good infrastructure. Overall the staff was courteous & helpful. Food provided was basic & there",RAJIV1954,/Profile/RAJIV1954,"New Delhi, India",30
ladakh,"I traveled to Leh last week through Dpauls package who provided me stay at Nature Residency hotel. When I was travelling to the hotel for the first time, I did not have good impression about the hotel, however when I reached hotel, I quite liked it. Best part of the hotel was the lovely view of the Indus river and Stok-Kangri peaks. The hotel is situated right on the bank on the river Indus and sitting on the bank during morning and evening makes feel so good. t was so peaceful that I felt like spending my whole life there. The hotel people are so lovely and good that I made friends with them. They are quite helpful and always ready in our service. We were provided breakfast and dinner by the hotel. Food was good as well. I always used to stuff myself at the hotel whether it is",paritosh a,/Profile/Pari1905,"Chandigarh, India",40

Food and hotel staff is very cordial and good, but the internet wi-fi was not working in the hotel for some time now... The view from the rooms was very good... High on cleanliness....

ladakh,"Nature residency is a clean, basic place to settle down in Leh as you explore distant places and comeback periodically to catch your breath.  I stayed in the suite and was pretty happy with the comfort the place offered. The place is right next to a tributary of the Indus and has beautiful view of the surrounding hills. It is in Choglamsar on the outskirts of Leh. Yet it is easy to take a shuttle and visit Leh market.  The hotel room service is very efficient. What took me by surprise is the variety and quality of food they served in dinner. Local delicacy, continental, Chinese etc. I was always looking forward to the next dinner.  The Dalai Lama apparently stayed here during one of his visits. I liked the sit out outside the lunch room by the side of the Indus.  This is a nice",Bhubonpothik,/Profile/Bhubonpothik,"Thane, India",40
ladakh,"This hotel is very well located on the banks of the river though very far from the market. Need car to go to and fro from market. This is relatively newly made and they are still adding more rooms and I am sure they will get enough clients to fill up those rooms. The food that they served was also good. There were only a couple of other inmates, apart from us, before the hotel closes down in September. In spite of that, the service they gave was nice.  This was a base for us during our Ladakh trip. We had to go to Nubra valley for one night and Uley for one night. Since, they did not have any inmates expected for the room, they also allowed us to leave our excess luggage in the room without charging us anything extra, which was quite considerate.  Now, w.r.t. food, we are Jains",malaylakhani,/Profile/malaylakhani,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"I stayed here for 6 nights at the beginning of August and from the moment i walked in, to the moment I left, the staff at the Nature Residency made sure there was no stone unturned in terms of making my stay comfortable.  First I had second thoughts about the location, because the hotel is not in the centre of Leh. But after arriving there I noticed, it gives the hotel its particular charm. The location is beautiful, situated directly on the Indus river with a amazing view to the mountains. Reaching the centre of Leh is not a problem at all, using taxis or the shuttle service from the hotel makes it quite easy.  The rooms are quite big and nicely designed and every room has riverview. Travelling through India I would say, in matter of cleanliness this was one of the best hotels",ymerkt,/Profile/ymerkt,"Konstanz, Germany",50
ladakh,"Stayed here for a night.  The room was okay and functional, nothing extravagant. We were provided with extra blankets as it was quite cold - though the turnaround time was not great. The food in their restaurant was awful - too oily and spicy. The table cloths were dirty - hygiene was somewhat of an issue. The restaurant was again too noisy - couldn't really have my food in peace. The only positive about this place is its location - right on the banks of the Indus. We had our breakfast on the rive deck. Breakfast service was again quite slow, but was okay in taste and quality. Overall - must visit for the location, otherwise, avoid completely",RajeevM19,/Profile/RajeevM19,"Mumbai, India",20
ladakh,"Stayed at the Nature Residency from 28th July to 4th August. Had an excellent time. Wonderful memories of first visit to Ladakh. Even though the location may seem inconvenient for some being slightly away from main market area, the hotel provided us shuttle services to main town.  Wonderfully spacious rooms with views of the Indus river. Clean bathrooms with hot showers. Good variety of food at the restaurant as well.  The staff was very helpful when my mother faced some breathing problems on the first day. Happy with services thanks to the front desk manager Mr Narender. Thanks!!  My cousins 10yr old boy was given a kayak to pedal around in the calm and clean waters of the river and he thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel has a really nice deck facing the river which guests can use",IndraniOm,/Profile/IndraniOm,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"I have been in leh this year on May month for a week, and stayed at this hotel, the hotel manager and staff were very good in services, they are always ready to help us in anything, we get their car daily for the visit of Leh market, as they are a bit off from the main market, but it hardly matters, there is beautiful river flows next to hotel, i wish all the best to all of them for making my trip memorable, and for the next time i will go there for sure...",Shail0412,/Profile/Shail0412,"New Delhi, India",50
