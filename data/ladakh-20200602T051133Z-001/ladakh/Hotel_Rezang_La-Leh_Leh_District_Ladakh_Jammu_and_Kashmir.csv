ladakh,"This is a fairly recently opened hotel located on fort road and pretty much at a walking distance from the main market and very close to restaurants as well. The rooms are nice and spacious, super comfortable beds and the hotel is kept very very clean. What I loved even more is the large poplar trees surrounding the hotel which give it a lovely backdrop view. They have a lovely garden to sit out and where you can have your breakfast or evening tea and if needed (by prior arrangement) have a nice barbecue too.   The bestest part about this hotel is the food!! The cook Rinkuji is a brilliant cook and whips up amazing dishes whether it be Indian or Chinese food. We had a bbq dinner and the kebabs he made were truly outstanding.   Last but not the least, a big shoutout to the owners",travellertrail6,/Profile/travellertrail6,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",50
