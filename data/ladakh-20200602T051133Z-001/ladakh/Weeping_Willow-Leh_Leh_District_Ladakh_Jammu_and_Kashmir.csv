ladakh,"I stayed at the camp for two nights and those were truly the  best two nights in Ladakh. My experience in Leh City has not been very good and the journey across Khardungla was tough as we were stuck up there for hours due to bad weather. We reached the camp quite late in the evening and were really exhausted. The camp staff welcomed us so warmly and the soup they served us on arrival (they were kind enough to think we might be starved and exhausted) was outworldly. The location and the ambiance of the camp was so amazing. It was nestled right below the Ladakh range in an orchid of willows with fresh glacial stream running through the property.  The staff and the ambiance made us feel at home and we had two wonderful nights at the camp.  Special thanks to Mr Sangrup, the owner ",Richard,/Profile/Richardandworld,,50

ladakh,The camps in Nubra are very expensive and they are not worth it. Weeping Willow is affordable and easy to reach. The food is really amazing and the staffs are cooperative. There are some monuments around you can visit during the early morning walk,Arun Pal,/Profile/Arunpal233,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,No doubt this is the best camp in Nubra and in the entire Ladakh. The camp is affordable  for solo travellers. The food is amazing and the staffs are friendly. Beautiful location which connects you with the nature.,Lobsang W,/Profile/LobsangW3,"Noida, India",50
