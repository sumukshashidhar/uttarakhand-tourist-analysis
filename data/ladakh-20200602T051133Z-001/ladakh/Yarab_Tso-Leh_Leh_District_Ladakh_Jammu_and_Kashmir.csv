ladakh,Well to start with Leh was one in my dream destinations list and to top it all Yarab Tso is the Hotel to stay . It was recommended by one of my friend who had stayed there previously and I had no doubt on his choice but when I reached the hotel I was mesmerised by the view of the hotel . Everything was just perfect right from the food to the service and the overall ambience of the hotel . The scenic beauty is something to die for. Special thanks to Stanzin who is the charm of the hotel who is not only professional but treats you like family . I will definitely recommend this hotel and would have given even more ratings if possible,Praful S,/Profile/808prafuls,"Doha, Qatar",50

ladakh,"We had a lovely stay at Yarab Tso Hotel! Surrounded by mountains and countryside, it is guaranteed a beautiful sight to wake up to in the morning. The amiable and attentive staff took good care of us and we felt welcomed and very much at home. I have to add that the meals prepared were always scrumptious and the very thought of it makes me hungry!  The owner of the property and our guide, Stanzin, is knowledgeable and provides helpful assistance in organizing your stay around Ladakh. With safety in mind, he does his best in coming up with a good itinerary that allows you to maximize your stay and see the best places. We have most certainly found a new friend in him and his warm personality made it felt like we were visiting a long time buddy. -Thank you Stanzin!   It was always",Hui Ting C,/Profile/HuiTingC16,,50

ladakh,"Yarab Tso in Leh is just what you are looking for. It provides all necessary amenities without making it a commercial, touristy place. It has maintained a homely local vibe to it. And Stanzin, who is the owner as well, is just so hands on in making you feel comfortable and settled in. He also gave us amazing local recommendations for food, sight seeing and logistic support. They have a place in Nubra as well which is even prettier. Stanzin, take a bow! :)",Shruti C,/Profile/370shrutic,"New Delhi, India",40

Every single employee that I encountered at the hotel was as personable and helpful as any hotel I have ever stayed at. The whole stay was luxurious and outstanding.  It was pleasure to stay at yarab tso . Located near to the airport.  We were six friends  that stayed for about 8 days .

But after my memorable 08 days long stay (July 27 to Aug 03) in Leh I could not stopped myself to write review on Hotel Yarab Tso, Leh.  To start with, the hotel is 10 minutes drive from the airport and near the junction of Srinagar-Leh and Manali-Leh Highway. Hotel is new, neat & clean with large rooms and good facilities, dining are hygienic. . The rooms and washrooms are very very clean, we never ran short on water and have sufficient supplies of toiletries. It's a home away from home.

He will never let you feel bored especially if you are traveling alone.He is a great jolly person. Many congratulations to him and his team too Sher Singh , Dorjay , Ujwal and  Manish  who never left a chance to please me.  Not only being close to airport make this hotel special but it has  all  modern day facilities that will make you choose it over others especially people who are running the show.

Initially I was so confused with the various hotel options but after my trip ended I could go back n say that it was the best decision to stay here. Great hospitality, very warm and friendly staffs. Great location. Not too noisy. Easily accessible to Leh town. The rooms r spacious and clean.  The hotel has more of a boutique feel.

ladakh,We visited this hotel in June 2013 during our Leh trip. Its not at all a satisfying experience. I selected this hotel from TripAdvisor reviews only. Though the hotel has great location but the amenities are not that good. the wash rooms are not good. The entire atmosphere was very eerie with lots of odd sounds on roof top at night. There are other better options in Nubra than this.,subhayanc,/Profile/subhayanc,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",20
ladakh,"Dull and drab, the Yarab Tso could be so much better with a bit of TLC. The building is in a beautiful traditional Ladakhi style, surrounded by a pleasant apple and vegetable garden. The rooms have the bare necessities but nothing more; some things work, some don’t. The bathroom wasn’t very clean. The dinner was rice, dhal and cauliflower, take it or leave it. Tea and water were the only drinks available. The TV was left on blaring in the dining room. The staff had no records of bookings, requests (e.g. for 2 single beds), or deposits paid. They were pleasant enough but rather indifferent. All in all, the Yarab Tso is rather uninviting, and you would probably do better with one of the many small guest houses dotted throughout the villages of Nubra valley.",tnbms162016,/Profile/tnbms162016,"Tokyo, Japan",20
ladakh,"We were a group of 6 ladies travelling around Ladakh in early August.  In Nubra we stayed in a charming family run hotel - Yarab Tso.  The rooms were bright and overlooked the kitchen garden with apple, walnut and apricot trees.  Though basic, the rooms were comfortable with attached bathrooms with running hot water.  Regzin, the owner, turned out to be a great chef, proving that simple dishes cooked with the freshest ingredients sprinkled with love, can taste amazing! We got to meet his mother, pretty wife and 3 adorable children.  This hotel is the best in the area! Enjoyed our 2 day stay at Yarab Tso before departing for Pangong Lake.",vsmehta2011,/Profile/vsmehta2011,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,Hotel Yarab is right in the middle of a beautiful valley with serene surroundings. The property is big considering its remoteness. It is the private residence of the owner converted into a homestay.  We were 2 families with kids having booked 2 family rooms. Incidently we were the only guests that night. The menu is limited but the food was good. They allowed us inside the kitchen in the morning and we learnt how to make ladakhi bread.   All in all it was a good experience except that the staff was getting irritated at our enthusiasm quite often.,InstinctiveTraveller,/Profile/InstinctiveTraveller,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",40

The property itself is beautiful, the rooms are nice and clean with tonnes of sunlight, even a cute little roof window in the bathroom for times when there is no power. The garden is stunning, with apple, apricots and walnut trees.   The food is amazing, some of the best I ate in Ladakh, the veg momos are to die for, and the Ladakhi bread at breakfast was yummm. The staff is attentive and very welcoming. Yarab Tso was a gem of a find, and we loved every minute of our stay here. Highly recommended!",aparajita b,/Profile/AparaDelhi,Delhi,50

We were then served the most amazing lunch and you could tell it was made with love and care. Our rooms were large, clean and comfortable and served us well for a restful nights sleep after a long day on the road. Breakfast the next day was also just lovely.

This place kept my excitement on after crossing khardung la.  The care and attention offered by Rigzin for his guests made a huge impact on me. And the cherry on top of cream was the food an view which this place has to offer, the best part is to wake up in the morning  And watch the sunrise with the Salty tea in hand with the traditional bread. Relax Relax and Relax that’s what I can say and if there is some dare in you the best thing you can do is have a dip in the river, which will awaken your senses.

ladakh,"i zeroed in on Yarab Tso thanks to Tripadisor, and I was not disappointed . The place is beautiful, charming, nestled in a quite part of  Kygar in the Nubra valley. The trip to reach here was exhilarating and harrowing in parts.  Roads near Khardung La are bone jarring. The snowfall - unusual for this time of the year was pure bliss, but the huge delay when the pass was closed on the return journey made me uneasy. That said, the drivers on this side of the world are world are pure maniacs, and you can actually go off to sleep while they throw their vehicles round crazy steep bends near the pass.
