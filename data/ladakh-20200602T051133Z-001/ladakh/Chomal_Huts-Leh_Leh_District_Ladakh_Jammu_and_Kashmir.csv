ladakh,"Chomal Huts is a brand new property in Stok Village. The cottages have unbeatable views of Leh city in the front and Stok kangri peak in the back. The rooms are fitted with all the amenities you need to have a pleasant and luxurious stay. King sized beds with a fluffy duvet, satellite tv, 24-hour running water with solar panels for hot water, exquisite outdoor patio with picturesque views, and highly spacious living room to accommodate two other members of your family with extra beds. The place was sparkling clean when we reached there. The cottages have modern interiors with classical exteriors attuned to the spirit and culture of Leh, Ladakh.   The service at Chomal Huts was unbeatable. The staff was extremely courteous and respectful. They made sure we get everything we need",Amay K.,/Profile/eulphean,,50
