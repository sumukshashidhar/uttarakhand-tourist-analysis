ladakh,Great place with a cool setup. The food was good compared to the place and what we could have expected. The service is good too. The food is reasonably priced and worth the buck.  Definitely worth the try when you are in Nimoo.,janaknmistry,/Profile/janaknmistry,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"We stopped by at this wayside restaurant in Nimmoo, (the little village where most of the white water rafting activities on the Indus and Zanskar river occur) on two occasions as we traversed the Srinagar-Leh highway. It's a guesthouse with a garden restaurant, and the ginger honey tea we had here was really lovely.  They have good fast wifi as an added USP. Haven't stayed at their guesthouse, but only stopped by at the restaurant for refreshments. They have a clean toilet (with a view of the mountains lol), and i have seen many tourist groups stop here for buffet lunch (which i am sure is pre arranged by the tour operator).  My daughter accidentally spilt her tea and broke the glass, and the staff politely refused when i offered them reimbursement for the breakage.
