ladakh,"I was super impressed with this hotel. It was like love at first sight. The huge rooms with elegant decor was pleasing to the eyes. The bed was comfy and the washroom was clean. We had free breakfast included. The breakfast was limited to basic items like tea, coffee, toast, fruits etc. The tariff is superb compared to all the facilities provided here.

ladakh,"Stayed for a night here enroute to Leh from Srinagar. Was recommended this place by my driver. A fairly new property and just off the main market. Checked in by evening and were welcomed to beautiful snowcapped mountains with setting sun rays on its peaks. We were offered a good price including dinner and breakfast. As this was our first night in Ladakh region I asked the cook to treat us to some local delicacy and he recommended Thupka, the local noddles. It was yummy and especially enjoyed on a cold night. The staff thought just a few was extremely hospitable and friendly. They even made me a special salt tea on request as I like to eat and drink local when travelling. The rooms were comfortable with running hot water. A great place to stay for a night halt or even if you",GallivantingSoul,/Profile/GallivantingSoul,"Mumbai, India",50
