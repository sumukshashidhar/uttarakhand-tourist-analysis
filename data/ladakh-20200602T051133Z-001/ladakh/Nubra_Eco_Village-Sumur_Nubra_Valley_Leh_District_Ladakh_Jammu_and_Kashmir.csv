ladakh,"We are 2 families and booked 3 tents, traveled in jun 2019. All the tents having good king size bed ,mattress and quilt.Bath rooms need to be upgraded.Breakfast and dinner (both buffet) was included.The food quality is OK type. Power supply is from 7pm to 11pm only.So you must have extra batteries. The camp has lot of greenery and looks very nice. You can walk around the camp and outside to get good views of mountains. A beautiful river is flowing near by and u can take pictures there too. This place is far away from hunder camel riding ground.",manash sahoo,/Profile/manash1975,"Cuttack District, India",40
ladakh,we had one night stay at ecovillage. the stay was comfortable. camp was really pretty and location was picturisque. We had some great pictures. BUT FOOD WAS KILLING and behaviour of staff was not at all appreciable. So slow service. Two of my friends had cramps after having dinner at night. Luckily we were carrying medicines for common illnesses as we were aware that medical facilities would be a challenge in such locations. My advice to carry medicines and some dry snacks because food is going to get you trouble for sure.  ,Pallavi,/Profile/Pallavi_Delhi_Ncr,"Ghaziabad, India",30
ladakh,We stayed there for one night. Tent was comfortable but food was extremely poor. It's very very bad. I will not suggest Eco village to any person. They give light from 7 to 11 pm only. Rest everything is chargeable without quality.,erjoyghosh,/Profile/erjoyghosh,"Ghaziabad, India",30
ladakh,"We few families visited Leh-ladhak and stayed here in Nubra.  There are 2 types of tents ( Type A and Type B).  Type As are a slightly upscale, newer tents and other wise no difference.   We visited in May end and it was cold. The provided beds and quilts were good.   Like other camps they run gensets for electricity. So please check the time for electricity and hot water. The attached bathroom was fine. They have morning 8 to 10 warm water.   Food was average. Breakfast and dinner was included in the package.  Extra tea was expensive. They charged Rs 50 per cup.  The camp has lot of greenery and looks very nice. You can walk around inside the came and outside to get good views.  Over a nice stay.",Debasisb2002,/Profile/Debasisb2002,"Bangalore Rural District, India",40
ladakh,The Eco Village is set amidst the eye catching greens of Willows and Apricots and Safedis and against the backdrop of a gargling waterfall . We stayed in two well equpped Swiss Tents for two nights and it was an amazing stay. They serve some lip- smacking food made from the organic vegetables that are grown in their farms.The staff are very helpful and well behaved. The place quietens the soul.,Asmita M,/Profile/asmitaswarup,"Jalna, India",50
ladakh,"What a gem, beautiful garden and tent is absolutely wonderful. You do not need the internet and learn to enjoy the secluded and peaceful campsite. The food was great and we cancelled leh night and  extend one more night on extra cost as our package was only 1 night in nubra .  But the beauty was so good that we cannot move on . we wake up very late . river water sound are so melodious. like Mom Loorrrryyy......",eliza d,/Profile/elizadec7,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,Visited Nubra in Sepetember 2018 with family. The stay at Nubra Eco Village was very pleasant. They provide Swiss tents at lush green property with apple orchards and farms. The location of the property is very beautiful on the foothills with greenery. There is a small stream flowing through the property. Dinner and Lunch provided was average and had limited options. The place is near to the sand dunes of Nubra.  Now coming to negative side : In whole Nubra area power will be available only from 7 PM to 11 PM and after 11 PM there was no generators or emergency lights provided. No other lights will be available which makes it extremely dark. Service is average and no service provided at night after 11 PM if there is any emergency. ,Raghu,/Profile/Raghu_traveller01,"Bangalore District, India",40
ladakh,"These are very clean and beautiful tent stays amidst the nature. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The entire place has got wonderful surrounding with flowers, trees, water, hills everywhere. They also arrange for campfire on demand. The food is pure veg which is just ok in taste.",vipultmi,/Profile/vipultmi,"Pune, India",40
ladakh,"It was a Friends trip to Leh and one of our stop was Nubra. Reaching there was a mesmerizing experience. Nature's beauty at its best. It was a VOW moment seeing the camp. Surrounded by lush green cover and water flowing nearby. The staff was polite and helpful. We stay in super deluxe tents and it was great. It was very cold climate and food served was hot and tasty. On our demand, the staff arranged for bonfire (it was chargeable). it was a full moon night and the experience at night was memorable. At night we could hear the sound of water flowing loud and clear, it was heavenly feeling. Loved the place and the staff.",KalpeshkumarJ,/Profile/KalpeshkumarJ,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"We stayed here for a day on 16th October and really enjoyed staying here. So these are Swiss camps, a stream of river flows between the camps and one fast stream just outside it. Campus has beautiful flowers, hammocks, born fire place, luminescent lamps and overall its a very picturesque campus. Inside the tents we get decent bedding, clean bathrooms and electricity(only during the evening since everything is on generator)  Pros: 1) Awesome location of the entire campus,feels surreal 2) Proper warming options for night 3) Courteous and friendly staff  Cons: 1) Electricity only during evening 2) Hot water only during morning 3) Food was too spicy for my liking 4) I found the camps not very clean from inside like my pillow had hair on them.  Overall it is a decent place",gaurav_humble,/Profile/gaurav_humble,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"My husband and I visited Leh Ladakh from 17-23 aug through OYO travel packages. We were put up at Nubra Eco Village for our overnight stay at Nubra. The campsite was beautiful with a scenic view of the mountains in the background, colourful flowers all over the camp and a stream of glacial water running through! The sound of the stream was the most therapeutic thing to experience. We arrived in the afternoon and were welcomed by the manager Mr Sharma. Him and his staff were very helpful and courteous. The tents were basic but lovely and clean. We had booked a standard tent which was good enough for the two of us but we also took a look at the deluxe tents which were bigger with an additional sit out and changing room connected to the bathroom. We had a lovely experience chilling",Christine r,/Profile/Christiner3915,,50
ladakh,We stayed here for single night and experience was quite good. Food & Service was good. We asked for warm water they presented it. We were having free time & asked for anything to play and they gave us Badminton Rackets & shuttle to play. Even at a place where impossible to live. They are providing best services.,Tejas S,/Profile/779tejass,"Ahmedabad, India",50
