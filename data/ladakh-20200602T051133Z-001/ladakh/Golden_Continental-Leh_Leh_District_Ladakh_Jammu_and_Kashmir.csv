ladakh,"We went for a business meet, the hotel was a decent hotel with good food and clean room. The food was quite healthy compared to other hotels.The room was quite big for two people. They also provide us good warm blanket as it was quite cold. The location of the hotel was very comfortable",cherimoya j,/Profile/cherimoyaj,"Long Beach, California",40
ladakh,"The breathtaking Leh is full of surprises - such small little hotels will take your breath away with their home like hospitality and warmth. You will feel so warm and cozy inside this hotel that you won't ever feel like going out! On a serious note, the days we spent here were pretty great and the location is right on the street so you don't have to roam a lot in the cold for dinner.",Shreyasi J,/Profile/ShreyasiJ,Pune,30
