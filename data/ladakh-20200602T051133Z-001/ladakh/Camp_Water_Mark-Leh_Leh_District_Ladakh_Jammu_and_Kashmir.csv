ladakh,"Camp is right on the lake !!! One of the most beautiful camp sites in the world .  It's probably the closest camp from the pangong lake..you can simply seat infront of the tent and spend the full day looking at the mesmerizing beauty of the pangong tso lake   Tents are nice with a private bathroom in each camp. Hot water supply is given in the morning.   On request, they kept the generator running for extra time at night.   Great views of the lake is a boon but one has to be prepared to overcome windy and chilly challenges from nature. Nights can be freezing   At this location and With the limitations in place, I believe its the best a camp can provide.

ladakh,"The location is great at the edge of Pangong Lake. The property has to depend on far off Durbuk town or even beyond for any kind of supplies including fresh water. Power supply is restricted to three hours a day from 1930 hrs to 2230 hrs. With these limitations in place, they managed to really take care of our needs and wants without any issues. While they do have emergency lamps they provide the same only on request. Great views of the lake is a boon but one has to be prepared to overcome windy and chilly challenges from nature. Nights can be freezing and having the oxygen cylinder handy is advised. Excellent views of both sun set and sun rise add value.",Anand G,/Profile/50anandg,"Kochi (Cochin), India",40
ladakh,"After a month in India and wonderful accommodation everwhere from Delhi to Kashmir, I have to say this was by far the worst place we stayed in. The location close to the lake was the only thing going for it. We had to ask for the bedding to be changed when we got there. The tents and furnishings were tired and dirty and there was only a trickle of cold water from the taps.  Having said that I hasten to add that the staff (Behar boys a long way from home) were trying their best but with obviously little or no training. The food was OK but tablecloths like the bedding needed a good wash. Message to owner, wherever you are...this set up is not fair to either guests or inexperienced staff.",MimiNSW,/Profile/MimiNSW,NSW,10
ladakh,"Other than the fact that the camp is closer to the lake , all the other facilities are very bad , no hot water, no proper food , service is terrible and their accomodation rules are stupid , they are just in in for the money and are going to get shifted way back from the lake due to their excessive pollution.

ladakh,The plus point is that the camp is located very close to the lake. The tents are very flimsy and cannot offer any protection from the cold and the winds. We were a group of 6 girls who camped in Pangong and JUST couldn't sleep the entire night due to the excessive swaying of the tents due to harsh winds and biting cold. This property can be considered if you can withstand the cold and adjust to the flimsy tents. It was just a wrong choice of stay for us.

ladakh,"During our holidays in Ladakh, we had stayed in this camp for a single night. Main USP of this place is it's location which is on the banks of the mesmerizing Pangong lake. The white tents have a king size bed along with attached bath having all modern fittings. Hot water is only available in buckets in the morning and this place gets extremely chilly at night with strong cold wind coming from the lake. Also electricity was available for 3 hrs only from 7 to 10 pm though there was provision of one battery light per tent. Dinner and breakfast provided was hot & tasty and we all liked it.

Beautifully located, the nearest from the lake was an experience of its own kind. They are tents! So treat them as one. They have tried best to give within it- bed, hot water that's all u need. It's freezing cold at night but amazing experience. They also gave us a camp fire and we had enjoyable time at night singing songs and dancing.. breakfast and dinner were good.. It's difficult but do get out of bed at sunrise time mesmerising view and photography. The overall experience is just amazing and unexplainable..",vrushali e,/Profile/vrushalie,,40

We reached Pangong a day earlier than our booking date due to an unavoidable change in schedule. However, the camp officials were happy to adjust our change of date. We stayed in camp number 2. The tent was adequately comfortable from inside. There were 2 beds with blankets, a sofa, a big rack for placing bags and a washroom. Although the were not five star amenities, this was pretty decent for a night stay. They also provided 2 bedside night lamps. The electricity was sufficiently provided and exceeded my expectations.

ladakh,"We had booked Camp Watermark solely because of its proximity to the lake. Having said that, we were really not expecting such poor facilities and misbehaving people. We had stayed in Camp Himalayan Spirit in Jispa on the way to Leh, where we had a very amiable experience. But from the very first moment we were disappointed with camp watermark. Camps are dirty and poorly maintained. The light outside our camp as well as one of the lights inside camp was not working. Some of the camps have table and chair and some don't, hence keeping our belongings was very difficult. Bathroom was clean. However, they would provide you only 1bucket of hot water for the entire day, and that too only between 6-7am!! In such a cold place like Pangong its very difficult to use cold water all the day.",jazzsharmi,/Profile/jazzsharmi,"Calcutta, West Bengal, India",20
ladakh,"This camp is located close to the lake with an unobstructed view and that's about it. For everything else you'll have to rough it out. By the smell and color of the linen, I doubt they wash it after each use. So be sure to sleep in a full sleeve hoodie and tracks, which is also advisable since it gets really windy and the tents have several tears that leave you vulnerable to the elements.  Surely you wouldn't be dreaming about bathing, but if you'd like to wash yourself, you can get half a bucket of lukewarm water.  While they claim to have a generator that runs from 7pm to 10:30pm, we weren't lucky enough to have it in a working condition. So we ate in almost darkness (just a torch) which was probably good because given the taste of the food, I really didn't want to look at it.",asgerali,/Profile/asgerali,"Pune, India",20
ladakh,"Camp Watermark is advertised as a Deluxe Camp and so are the prices comparable to a decent hotel. The value for money is not that great though! Let's start with the positive side: Among all Camps, the location and thus the view is one of the best. However, that's it. The food is ok. Now the negative sideThe owner of the camp seems to give a s*** how the camp is run. This is reflected by various facts: first of all the staff is totally untrained to work in hotel business. Some of them are friendly, though clumsy, others are mainly doing their job in the most bored way possible. We learned that the personnel comes from the poorest places from India, which in turn means they are poorly paid at this remote place. The owner sits in Leh.

Either just outside your tent or walking few steps to the bank of the lake, would take you to different world & make you forget everything else. The weather had not been conducive, so would want to make it again..",AddictedtoLife,/Profile/AddictedtoLife,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,"This is a tented accommodation of about average quality. The location is fantastic being on the edge of the Pangong Tso and one could sit outside the tent enjoying the panorama of the hills and ever changing colour of the lake waters.  The Camp itself left much to be desired, even though it is in such a remote place. The pathway along the tents was very uneven and difficult to negotiate in the dark. The Plinth on which some of the tents were built were badly in need of repairs and most of us (there were 7 of us) had beds that sloped to one side and leaving a feeling that one could fall off the bed easily. Food was not exceptional and service was below average.  The staff were not particularly attentive. There was loud music coming from beyond the kitchen area and we had to get",M K S,/Profile/Mikeksan,,30
ladakh,We searched for Camp Watermark once we reached Spangmik as we have read many reviews in TA site and really those were not just the words.. This camp really lived upto the expectation. Tent is very much clean they have very neat cemented bathroom and towels were very clean. We just admired how come they are giving this clean linens even in this hostile condition. Wind were blowing to its potential but once we zipped in we didnt feel the wind.. but the upper portion of the camp fluttered a lot at night nothing much scarry. They provided tea and biscuit when we asked and there is no limit to that.. Dinner and Breakfast they have a decent spread and the staff's are very helpful.. If i come back to Spangmik then this is going to be my stay..  Its not so near to the lake and no camps,Chandrasekar,/Profile/srchandra,"Singapore, Singapore",50
ladakh,"We reached there from Leh after facing snowfall on the way. It was chilling cold (they said it was minus 10 - couldn't cross check personally). The heavy winds made us shiver - wondering if we would get thrown away to the faraway mountains on the Chinese side. But the Tent made us withstand all these. Fantastic bed with good linen, quilts and a hot water bag under each quilt. An hour after going to bed, we were fast asleep. We were also given enough hot water in the morning to freshen up. The food was much better than you would expect under such circumstances. Piping hot Soup and a vegetarian buffet spread was really appetizing and filling. Breakfast was equally good. The view of the Lake is fascinating. As the sun sets you get to see the colour changing in the distant mountains",Subhasish M,/Profile/15subhasishm,"Kolkata, India",50
ladakh,"Let me start by saying that, don't expect service like hotels, since this is a temporary camp, running only for 4-5 months.  Now, coming to location, this camp is right on the lake and food was excellent (only veg food though). These couple of things that should make up for anything else found wanting like tent size, temporary toilets (although attached).  When visiting here, please be mindful of the fact that you are going here to spend night of the shore of Panagong Lake, and anything else is a bonus. If some adventure is not your cup of tea, then just do a day visit to Lake and go back to hotel you are staying in.",VJ81,/Profile/VJ81,Gurgaon,40

No proper cutlery to have meals. No warm water to take bath. Toilets have just standing space. They are operating on lease model on a local's land and giving him peanuts. We did second day at Himalyan Retreat and they charges just Rs 300 for an hour of bonfire. Himalyan Retreat has proper printed towels, cutlery, good dining hall and excellent food.

This is the third time we stayed (earlier being June 2011, Aug 2012) here; and the management decided to have new tents, however, in doing so, reduced the bathing and toilet area, creating space constraints.

The facilities provided are basic but considering the remote location we thought it was a very good job done. We were provided with decent food and the service provided was good. Electricity is a problem at Pangong. They use generator which is switched off at 11 pm. It is very cold at Pangong and no power supply means you cannot use electric blankets which makes the night stay uncomfortable. But a one night stay is recommended considering the beauty of the place.",jmajumdar,/Profile/jmajumdar,"Kolkata, India",50

What does help is that though absolutely basic, the staff takes care to ensure that you are as comfortable as possible in such conditions. There are no electricity points anywhere, except the one CFL in the room and one in the attached bath. These too come on only between 7:30 pm and 10 pm, when the generator is run. So make sure your gadgets are fully charged before you arrive here.

There are a bout 5-6 good campsites at Pangong Lake, but we chose this simply because its the prettiest, closest to the lake, and is unbelievably clean (by Ladakh standards).  It's run by an ex-Army person, and his special touches show everywhere. We reached the place a lil late owning to the bad roads, but we were still welcomed by warm tea and lunch. They also made pipping hot pakoras for us (poppers) at our request.   The place has clean loos, although water could be a problem.

The camp location is superb and it appears that the camp is equipped with all the basic amenities that you would need for an overnight stay.  However, there were a few issues in the functionality of the amenities such as, the bed was extremely hard and all seven of us had a hard time sleeping on it, there was no water in the loo during our entire stay.   I would like to highlight that service was good. The staff helped us get water in the morning and the food they served in their dinner and breakfast was yummy.

We felt this is an advantage as not many day tourists come this far, however it does compromise on the views, there are much better places before this actual site, which has better views.  Like all the other camps in the site, there is a huge water problem. They do provide water once in 4/5 hours, where one needs to fill the buckets, however this is not guaranteed. The color of the water provided looks scary, and we had to use mineral water to brush our teeth. If the camps are full, there is usually no water in the morning, with everyone trying to use the restrooms, it becomes a pain without water.

Camp watermark is right next to the lake and its an amazing experience to be next to the lake when it is shining under the morning sun.    At Rs 4000/ night, this is one of the more expensive accommodations of our trip but the beauty of the place was worth it.  The tent was clean and had the basic amenities (cant ask for more at that altitude).   Food was nice as well.

The fabric walls rattle in the wind, but they feel secure and the tent appears surprisingly clean -- for a tent camp. A toilet is attached and separated from the sleeping part of the tent by a zippered flap. There is a patio outside the door of the tent where you can sit and watch the lake. The management is friendly and competent. The ubiquitous barking dogs are a pain but that will only be resolved with a few good recipes.  Camp Watermark is considered the best accommodation on the lake. The dining room tent is a short walk from the sleeping tents -- meals were substantial and delicious.

Then few locals came to our rescue and luckily there was a room available at a nearby guest house. We later realized that it was the Pangong resort. The staff at the Pangong resort was very helpful and made us very comfortable. They didnt take any money from us. On returning to Delhi, we demanded for a refund from 'Camps of Ladakh' office.
