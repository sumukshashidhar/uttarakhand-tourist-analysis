ladakh,"I went there to make enquiries and the fact that they have a lighted sign (which was on) gave me every reason to think that this place is still functioning as a hotel. However, when I asked one guy who was there in the dining room, he told me it's not a hotel! There is an office of the power company there, but I'm sure there must still be a hotel or they wouldn't have the sign on. There was no one else to ask and I didn't bother to call. There are lots of pluses that I could see. The place looks nice, and the view is quite a good one and it's on a quiet road.",Peregrineri,/Profile/Peregrineri,"New Delhi, India",20
ladakh,"The view from this hotel is ecstatic. We experienced some issues with the smelly washrooms and mattresses, as they dont seem to be well maintained as such may be because of the climate there but no issues otherwise.",Alfredo812,/Profile/Alfredo812,"Miami, Florida",30
ladakh,"I took services of this hotel located near Leh Bazaar on Karzoo Place or Road.  Please do not be confused with the ""Karzoo Guest House"" because that is another guest house/hotel on the same Karzoo Road. I stayed at this hotel on and off for about a week. I have enjoyed this hotel, to be honest. I find that the kitchen staff was extremely polite and offered excellent services to my family. The food was delicious, specially Papadum were really tasty. The view was amazing; I would wake up early morning to catch the beautiful view of the sun rising. The only thing made me sick was the smell in the washroom.  The hotel manager has to provide an air freshener or do something about managing the foul smell coming from the washroom. Overall, I would recommend people to take services of",hahk95,/Profile/hahk95,"Toronto, Canada",30
