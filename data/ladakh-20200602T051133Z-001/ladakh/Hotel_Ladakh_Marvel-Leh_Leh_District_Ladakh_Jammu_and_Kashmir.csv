ladakh,"The hotel was good stay was pleasant, food was good but the menu was repeated every day thus it makes difficult for u to eat food if you stay for more than a day everything else was good only thing is bad was it is in narrow roads which is far from market",Nishant s,/Profile/640nishants,"Baran, India",20
ladakh,"I have booked a family vacation thru Travel triangle tour company... they offered it as 3star hotel which is in high demand.  After reaching I understand that it is 15 room building, situated in very narrow street where normal driver canâ€™t park the car... Outside building at entrance ,you will find staking of bricks & old toilet seat  Out of 15 only 5 were occupied and almost all are duped by travel company. Also it has no ventilation even in toilet...  please be careful do your study before booking.",Rakesh Mohan M,/Profile/RakeshMohanM,"Greater Noida, India",20
