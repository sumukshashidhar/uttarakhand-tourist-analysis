Sonam was simply fantastic and his team led by Sachin went the extra mile to make us as comfortable as possible.

Apart from this and the wonderful view overlooking the balconies, the rooms, linen and bathrooms are really clean. Food is great too.   When I came to stay at Himalayan residency, I told Sonam, the owner of Himalayan residency I did not want to do the typical touristy tour, that I wanted to see the lives of Ladakhis and experience the rich culture of Ladakh and Sonam and Rigzin made exactly that possible. Sonam customises your tours according to your wish and budget and often goes out of his way to ensure that you make the best memories in Ladakh. I was fortunate enough to visit both their villages",Asma,/Profile/Safarnaamaa,"Pune, India",50

ladakh,I stayed there for almost 7 days from 29th August to 5th September 2017. This hotel is situated some 3 km away from leh market. So it's a bit difficult to go to the market every now and then. But believe me you will not feel the need to go to the market once you are in leh. The hotel is situated in a picturesque location surrounded by hills and snow capped mountains. Rooms are okay and with a fantastic balcony. If you have choice then try to take rooms at the reception floor.. 301..302.. etc. Staff behaviour is very humble. They will be always there to help you. The hotel manager is also a nice person. Food is quite okay. They have 5-6 course buffet dinner and breakfast. Lunch option is la karte.

When we did early checkout they packed us sandwiches to eat on the way. It was around 6 am or something. 3. Ground floor room has very nice balcony to it. However, i'd suggest go for 4th floor rooms. 4. They have pre decided menu printed in the dining area. So you won't get any surprises in the food.  Bad things :  1. They have fixed dinner timing i.e. 8:30 - 9:30. Which i feel should be extended at least till 10:30. 2. Far from market. So going and coming back from market if you don't have your own vehicle will cost you at least 200-300 rs. 3. No parking inside hotel. Just outside the road plenty of parking is available.

Sonam, the owner, and brothers Rikzin and Ishe went out of their way to be helpful, iron out glitches, and make me feel extra comfortable and at home! I had one unfortunate situation that happened, which the team helped find a solution to...which I've been really thankful for!   The hotel is clean, and the bathrooms, which I'm finicky about, are spotless! The service is cheerful, professional and prompt, which makes you forget that you're in the middle of a remote alpine desert!  The food is good...and the views are stunning!

ladakh,I stayed in this hotel Late June 2016.  Pros: 1. Amazing view form the room 2. Too good chef - equivalent to home made rotis and curries 3. Extremely helpful staff - Ready to go beyond their duties for your comfort 4. The owner Sonam Rinchen (Also a travel agent) - Well known to the place with great contacts - gave me excellent camps at Pangong and Tsomoriri and Sarchu. 5. The hotel is located .5- 1 km out of the main market area - very peaceful and scenic locale.  Cons: 1. A little small hotel but newly built. 2. Not walkable from Leh main market - need to take a cab ride.  Thats all I could summarize. All in all Very satisfying experience,rakesh s,/Profile/rakeshs2230,,50

ladakh,"The Himalayan Residency Ladakh gives you all you need for a wonderful stay on the top of the word! Service is great, rooms newly made, clean and comfy, the view is simply stunnig. The Hotel is well located but still you can have calamity and a peaceful hideaway. Most of all: the staff is caring, friendly and warmhearted. :) I can highly recommend it!",chu_li667,/Profile/chu_li667,"Graz, Austria",50
ladakh,"Hotel Himalayan Residency Ladakh is one of the best places in Leh for one simple reason. People are extremely warm, co-operative,picturesque views from the room and decent food. It is also very well located in the heart of Leh,not too far from the city yet not too close from the hussle of the market. for us this will be our home the next time we visit leh and hopefully that will be soon> cheers",sonam r,/Profile/sonamr_11,leh ladakh india,50
