ladakh,"I stayed at Overland Heights in November 2016 and then again at July 2017 and October 2017. Everytime I stayed at this panoramic place, was filled with peace and tranquility.  Thanks to excellent staff at Overland office who took care of me as they would do to their loved ones and not to miss the loving and kindness of proprietor of Overland Heights, Tundup Dorjey.  The food at Overland Heights is very good and rooms are very neat and tidy and the staff ensures that everything is spick and clean.  The fittings of bathroom, heating facility at room, sofa and mattresses fit the standards and the proprietor has ensured that the best is done for accommodation.  This has elevator and is one of a kind in that area and the place is just 5 minutes away from airport.  Best for people who",Vilas K,/Profile/613vilask,,50
