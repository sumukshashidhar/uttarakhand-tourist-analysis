ladakh,"I stayed at Lharimo north for the first time last year and since then iv gone back there twice..and each time they have surpassed all my expectations..be it food,service or in terms of the whole experience all together!! It just gets better everytime!!! Iv had the best time lazing in the hammocks in their garden with a book while listening to the ripe apricots fall from the trees and the sound of the stream navigating its way through the garden..not to forget stargazing in a sleeping bag from their tree house with a bottle of rum, sitting by the bonfire riverside and waking up in the morning with the view of the snow capped mountains right front of you ..it's just amazing!! It's very close to the panamik hot springs and prolly the nearest place to stay from there..The owners",Jade house ladakh,/Profile/jadehouseladakh,,50
ladakh,I and my parents stay for 1 night. I really love the staff there. They service us like 5 stars hotel. Always care and ask us if we want any more things.  The room was very clean and cozy with spacious bathroom. The hot water is available at ceiling shower. We really love the room.  Milky way and millions stars are in the sky in front of the bedroom.  The best point I love to sit there for relaxing ans rest is at the mountain front. They have a cozy living area with comfortable sofa so we can have some tea/coffee in front of the stunning mountain view.  Thanks all staff to take good care of us while we were at Lharimo North.,Bell L,/Profile/bellee09,"Bangkok, Thailand",50
ladakh,"We stayed at this hotel for three nights and thoroughly enjoyed our visit.  During our stay, there were only a very few others staying at the hotel so perhaps we were fortunate in getting so much personal attention by the owner and his family.  They were just wonderful and the rest of the staff was very accommodating and friendly as well.  The cottages are comfortable and clean.  Be aware electricity in this area only goes on for evening hours but hot water is available also in the morning for a few hours.  A TV and internet connection is available in the evening in a sitting room in the main building.  We were amazed at the food which was fresh (locally grown vegetables from their own farm), varied (each meal was different for our three days there), and extremely well prepared.",Stan B,/Profile/718stanb,Boulder,50
ladakh,"Very pretty lovely little cottages. Amidst of mountains and river next door. Electricity is only available for few hours in the evening. WIFI connection during power is available so an incentive for those who wish to connect with the world. PEACE, CALM and full of serenity.   The place is wonderfully managed by royal family. The cute little kid is best host you will find during your stay.  recommended!",Mo_trp,/Profile/Mo_trp,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"Well, from Lharimo in Leh this place is a 100 times better. They grow all food materials on-site, the wonderful owner's family lives right at the property; they were wonderful and very welcoming, the staff needs to learn to be more polite and service efficient but they are learning. If you walk towards the river side of the property they have a wonderful tree-house where we got a chance to have a small picnic and that was just amazing! Thank you Lharimo North for making it a memorable trip!",Travel_amazingly_007,/Profile/Travel_amazingly_007,Indiana,50
ladakh,"Lharimo North has a very pretty campus overlooking the snow peaked Himalayas. Small cottages amid lushes of green, and in the middle of nowhere. The beautiful setting is sure to provide complete relaxation. The cottages were small and quaint. Washroom was spotless. Hot water is available for 2 hours in the morning (6am - 8 am). Food was okay and the staff is very helpful. Electricity is available post evening. They also have a working wifi in their reception area with a decent speed. They also arrange camp fire for groups upon request (Not sure if it is chargeable). We wished we could have stayed here longer. Highly recommended.",junket15,/Profile/junket15,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
ladakh,The property  is located in midst of mountains.  A beautiful view to wake up too.  Electricity in this village available  from 7pm to 11pm.  The stars in the night are visible as if we are in the space.  Hot water available.  My issues were with the bugs especially  the one that goes in the ear and eat brain tissues.   We ensure none of bed edges touched the  wall. We stuffed cotton in our ears and slept off. But we must not forget that we are in forest so can't crib a lot.   Food was good.  Apricot  jam they make is yum.  They let us take fresh Apricot fruits from their trees.  Lovely walk till their tree house.   Overall a beautiful place. ,snehakolambkar,/Profile/snehakolambkar,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"Me and my wife stayed in this hotel for 1 night on Sept 15th 2015. Was pleasantly surprised to see good rooms with comfortable beds after a long tiring journey to Nubra Valley. The rooms are small and have basic facilities. The bathrooms are clean and have running hot water in the Morning & Evening. The power goes off after 11 pm 7 there is no internet. There is no light at all in the hotel post 11 and you have to manage with torches & candle lights. The good thing about no lights its that you can see a breathtaking view of the night sky with milky way in its full glory. The food is surprisingly good. The breakfast has options and is wholesome with eggs, fruits etc. Day view is good with mountains flanking the hotel from all sides.

ladakh,"Coming here after having spent three nights in Shyok River Lodge was a big climb down (see my review of SRL). It started with the utter indifference of the staff which met us. After a long tiring drive, we could have done with a bit of warmth and smile. All we got were glum faces, no clear sense of who is in charge, and indifferent service helping our baggage to the rooms.   The rooms, ah. Musty, smelly, the bathrooms totally wet, the floors not swept, the sheets stained, the towels dirty. Took a whole lot of effort to kick start the cleaning, and despite everything, our bathroon continued to leak for the two nights we stayed.   Power available only from 7:30 pm to 11 pm.   Food: the Indian food one night was excellent. The chinese on the other night, less said the better. The",Sanjay,/Profile/Sanjay44,"New Delhi, India",20
ladakh,We visited in august 2015. We stayed   for 1 night only. Rooms were good. Scenic view around  hotel is also good. Hospitality is very good.   Power is only available from 6 pm to 11 pm. I think this is a common problem at all hotels at nubra  welly. The WORST part was FOOD. no verity  in veg food available. Even in fact they were not able to serve lime water to us.   ,Bhavik  S,/Profile/bhavik88,"Mumbai, India",20

ladakh,Very beautiful property. Real value for money. Both the service and the food is excellent. Extremely helpful staff. Rooms are neat and hot water is available. You may explore the tree house although it is difficult to reach as you have to walk through the water to reach there ;) An evening bonfire with light music can be organized on request.

ladakh,"After a long day trip to the sand dunes of Hunder and the Diskit Monastery, driving through a sudden sandstorm we arrived at the Lharimo North camp in the Nubra Valley. This place was like an oasis in the desert. The cottages were comfortable, clean and just right for our (2 families of 3 each) single night stay at Nubra. The housekeeping staff were warm and helpful. The food served for dinner was basic home cooked vegetarian fare but was absolutely brilliant both in terms of quality and taste and oozed of the love that had gone into its making. We could not have asked for anything more, honestly, after a hard days drive and sightseeing. Given its remote location and harsh conditions (electricity is available for just 3 hours in the months of April, May and June here) this place",AshisBhattacharya,/Profile/AshisBhattacharya,"Thane, Maharashtra, India",40
ladakh,"After 5-6 drives from Leh, we reached Nubra Valley. This hotel is located 2-3 kilometers from Samer Sand Dunes.  It is a hotel and not camp. there is one place in the hotel compound where they have kept chairs etc, that place has great view of the valley.  rooms are clean. Electricity is available for 4-5 hours after sunset. Hot Water is available only in the morning for couple of hours.  Food is average but even the remote location one should not expect much.  Overall a fairly decent experience.",VforVinay,/Profile/VforVinay,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"After a long travel in the cold mountains of Ladakh. This place is situated in midst of trees , which was very refreshing and lungs inhaled oxygen . river flows nearby, although mostly dried up in June . Rooms are clean, Service is quick. Dinner was delicious .Electricity only is there for few hours in the evening.It is very simply constructed.The farm house ,but no maintenance on the farm. There is no intercom in the rooms. there is no heater in the room ,tho none required in the month of June.",AnkitSetya,/Profile/AnkitSetya,"New Delhi, India",30
ladakh,"We stayed here for a night when in ladakh. We stayed in the cottage and not in the tents .it was clean and tidy. The bathrooms are quite modern.Rooms are small but clean.its a resort kind of place . The view from the place is very good overlooking the mountains.The service provided is average. The food in the buffet dinner and breakfast was decent , tasty and hhot.but the packed lunch they gave us was not upto the mark .they provided us rotten apples etc.so check before you leave. Also electricity is a problem here ,they say electricity is only available for 3 to 4 hours a day in whole of the valley which meant that lights would work from evening 7 to 10.So please carry your torch if you use toilets at nights. All in all a good place with no complaints about the stay.",nemshef,/Profile/nemshef,"Mumbai, India",40

ladakh,"Lharimo North is close to Sumur Sand Dunes and offers a good place to stay at this destination. The hotel has kept the nature value intact with no in-room televisions and limited hours supply of electricity, no mobile phone connection is available as well(though this is not a hotel problem / issue).  Staff is courteous and helpful. One can consider staying in Hunder instead of Sumur(place where this hotel is located) to save time for the sight-seeing points in the area.",VIG001,/Profile/VIG001,Mumbai,40
ladakh,"Lharimo North is a little piece of heaven. It is incredibly calm and tranquil, the hospitality and food is divine and it is an idyllic place to just switch off. Equally it is a enjoyable place for bigger groups.   We were group of 11 pax and the place offered heartwarming time. Had fantastic welcome with the tastiest pakodas and masala tea. Food was absolutely excellent, not to be missed pakodas and upma in the breakfast. The property is a small walk (like nature trail) to river and the highlight was the tree house by the river. Rooms were simple and clean with nicely done up spacious bathrooms. Another not to be missed is bonfire post dinner if you are in a group or stargazing at night. Optimum conditions for stargazing..  Magnificent!!!",Darshan R,/Profile/748darshanr,,40
ladakh,"Well.. what a fantastic stay we had here.. This hotel was included in our travel package arranged by Cox n Kings. Nestled between snow peaked mountains and forest, this was a sanctuary at best meant truly for nature lovers ! Individual cottages, fruit trees in front of the cottages and couple of mins walk to a nearby tree house and beautiful river made this hotel a must stay place. Food was good with varied options. Its sad to make a note that, we had the pleasure of staying here for just a night. Wish we could stay longer in this heaven on earth place.  The rooms were comfortable and the blankets provided were very good. The shortcomings ? well its hard to comment something negative for the kind of place this was.. but we had issues with the power/electricity !

Set up in lush green surroundings with hills on all sides, this place completely serves the purpose of your visit to Ladakh. The rooms are basic, yet very clean and the bathrooms are tidy. Electricity and hot water are available only for specified hours in the evening/morning. Food in the dining hall is the most amazing home like north indian food that I have ever had in a hotel. The hotel staff also arranged a bonfire for us (at a small price) on a full moon night. I really fall short of words when defining the helpful nature of the staff here.

Location is amazing on the banks of river Shayok, and view of surrounding snow peak mountains was beautiful. As Nubra valley is a kind of isolated tourist attraction , one cant expect luxury stay here, there is no electricity supply from government here, so about 3 hours generators are run in night time.

The staff is also very helpful and they have very good manners and are very soft-spoken. The rooms are very cosy and well-maintained and bathroom was clean, spacious and hot water was also available. Also, the food although, it is very simple is very tasty and freshly made. An interesting fact is that the room, cabin, tree house, etc. are all made from eco-friendly goods and in the traditional style and even then it is very cosy and warm, even though the rooms are not luxurious they give you a feeling of your home.

Don't do anything, just relax, chill, talk, breathe, eat and enjoy!!  Trust me you will feel like not coming back from here. Electricity comes only in night but so what who care and why you need it.

Plus it has a huge glass window so you don't miss out on the outside. The cottages though could have been better. They are clean, but not very comfortable.
