ladakh,We stayed overnight in this delightful camp in Sumur on our way to Nubra valley  in small village  of Sumur. The tents were  clean and comfortable with attached toilets . It has a lovely garden with swings and out door seating.   A bon fire can be arranged for the evening at an additional cost.  Food was average but palatable.  Theres a wifi connection  available  at the restaurant whenever theres electricity. One thing that we missed out on was sand dunes at Sumur and the dune lake. ,somam,/Profile/somam,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40

ladakh,"I have visited Ladakh second time with my family. This time we have been to different places in Ladakh. And one was in Nubra valley. Sumoor is among a  beautiful place in Himalaya and we have to visit it at least one time in life. Our stay was in Saser Camp. Frankly speaking it was my first experience to stay in a camp. When I entered in Saser Camp area, felt  closer to the Nature.Mr. Stanzin offered us  best hospitality. We were interested in local food, Leh berry juice and he has arranged it from home. Rooms were nicely maintained .Best Service offered.",ameyapathare,/Profile/ameyapathare,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Stayed 1 night in tent #101. Reached here late afternoon after traveling from Leh via Diskit, Hunder, etc. It was freezing but no hot water was available for us to freshen up. Had to use the freezing cold water to get through the basics. Bathroom facilities could have been a little better. We had to ask for toilet paper. The flush worked but you didn't want to be standing within a feet of it as the water spurts out and that is pretty disgusting! Commode is in dire need of a jet spray or a hand shower.   Tent was nice enough. Bedding was comfortable and sufficient. Electricity was available from evening 7 (approx.) to 11 (approx.) at night. Emergency lights were provided in the tent. It's pitch dark once lights are out, quiet and otherwise exciting if you are on your honeymoon or",AnuradhaGhose,/Profile/AnuradhaGhose,"Calcutta, West Bengal, India",40
ladakh,"The property has tents with small garden/play area in middle. The tents are good/spacious , beds are comfy and washrooms are also nice. Food is good. Tea is great. Staff is attentive. But beware of insects. The tents get electricity from 7Pm to 11Pm. Nights can be lively if you arrange a bon-fire but otherwise its pretty dull. All tents get hot water in day time. Overall its good camp site but too far from Valley.",AJAIN_India,/Profile/AJAIN_India,"Greater Noida, India",40
ladakh,"Had stayed there for a day after visiting the Nubra Valley my only regret being we didn't stay longer. The region is beautiful. Coming to the camp site, it's a bit difficult to locate especially in dark tho the maps guide you well. Reached there late in the night and couldn't see much of the surroundings till the next day  And boy we were in for a surprise in the morning. The camps are nestled in the lap of nature. The early morning bed tea in the glorious sunshine with the sound of flowing water is one of my favorite memories of the trip.  The food options are limited but the food is delicious.  The camp were very well maintained and with a private bathroom. The power goes off at 11 and comes back next day at 7 in the evening so remember to charge your batteries before 11.",Vildgenius,/Profile/Vildgenius,,40

ladakh,We stayed at Saser Camp for 2 nights while visiting the Nubra Valley in Ladakh. Very nice tented camp. Clean beds and linen and the bathrooms are clean. Flush toilet available. Unfortunately no showers while we were there but the staff provided us with more than enough hot water in buckets to bath with. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The dining room is clean with lots of seats available and food were great. Great place to stay while visiting the Nubra Valley. Will definitely make use of this camp again in future.,DesJacobs,/Profile/DesJacobs,"Lydenburg, South Africa",40

ladakh,"2 couples stayed here for one night during our excursion to Nubra Valley from Leh on our 8-day sojourn to Ladakh. You won't be disappointed if you know what kind of a stay you get in a camp. Very comfortable tents with extremely friendly and homely owners. It's almost like a homestay. The views are superb. Electricity was there only in the evening but we don't go to camp sites for modern amenities do we! Enjoy the sound of nature and the wilderness. Listen to silence in the night. The food was home cooked, hot and very nice. The peace we experienced was almost surreal. The owner got us hot water in the morning for people wondering in that direction.",Pritam_Assrani,/Profile/Pritam_Assrani,"Mumbai, India",40
