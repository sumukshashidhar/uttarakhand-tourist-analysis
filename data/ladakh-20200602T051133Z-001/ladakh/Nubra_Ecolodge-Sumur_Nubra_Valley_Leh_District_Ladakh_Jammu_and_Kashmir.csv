ladakh,"Located in the tiny hamlet of Sumur, Nubra Eco lodge is an ideal destination to enjoy the much needed tranquillity. As the name suggests, the place boasts of adapting an eco friendly approach for boarding and lodging. When you enter through the gates, you will find small patches of land where they cultivate vegetables and fruits for their cooking purpose. Since it is located in a small village, electricity is always scarce, hence they rely mostly on solar energy for most of their work.  The rooms are simple and clean. Each room opens into a balcony where there are some chairs placed so that you can enjoy the gorgeous vista of the mountains while sipping hot tea. Eco friendly are tents also available for accommodation but sadly they were all booked when we visited. There is also",Manasa,/Profile/ManasaM,"Bengaluru, India",50

ladakh,Large property with big vegetable garden in Sumur.  Visit Yadav Tso lake and the Nivea river.  Or stop by on way from turtuk/Hundar to pangong.  The location is great with mountains and desserts .  One can also enjoy double hump camel safaris.  Once Siachen opens - this will be booming place  Owner mr Stanzin has a great sense of design and is redoing his property.  Hope to see what he replaces his tents with.    The food is great and menu prices are super economical.    I had forgotten my memory cards and property owner was generous to send it back once he found it.

ladakh,If u are in Nubra valley you need to be surrounded by pristine mountains on all 4 sides. Thats Nubra Ecolodge. When we entered the property we thought we had booked the wrong one as the reception area is too modest. But from the cottage it is only us and nature.

ladakh,Really surprised by how much I enjoyed the Nubra Ecolodge. The photos do not do it justice. Stayed in a cottage which had the most comfortable bed of the trip in. Hot water available. Sitting on the deck outside the cottage looking at the scenery was absolutely breathtaking and even better at night. Walks in the local area were all inspiring. The people running this place are really kind. We enjoyed sitting talking with the owner over dinner and learnt a lot about the Nubra valley and Ladakh. Just really nice people. The food (especially for a vegetarian) was all incredible - the best of 9 days in Ladakh. It‚Äôs always good to see the food growing in front of you.

Amazing part of this property is that you will feel as if u are living unrestrained in the middle of nature. Tenants and cottages are aesthetically done. View of mountains from the cottages is to be experienced. Staff at the Eco lodge were very friendly and took good care of us. Food served is organic and grown right on the property.

We had booked 2 rooms but one of the rooms developed leaks in the toilet (due to the extreme weather of the passed winter) the management promptly upgraded us to a cottage/villa. I will recommend the villa or one of the rooms with an attached Balcony as you do get the benefit of enjoying the view every morning.  Dinner was fixed menu and was included in the package, Dishes changed every evening. The chef who is from Uttarakhand is a magician!

Tents are comfortable but in early May, the chill could be felt as temperatures dropped at night. Since, it was windy and we were feeling very cold, we requested the owner  to let us sleep in a common room instead of the tents, as the resort was fully booked.

The dinner on first night was a 3-4 course meal with almost 7-8 dishes. That was the standard they had set. And next day, it came tumbling down to zero.  The rooms weren't cleaned, no water was replenished. The second night dinner was only 2 dishes, Chinese without even checking with the guests if they are fine with the cuisine. A couple next to us asked if there was a dessert too, to which the staff said no. And the very next minute they served a dessert to two other couples sitting across us.

We were warmly greeted by the staff (Stenzing and a couple of others) and he guided us to our room and offered us tea/refreshments. The room and bathroom was very clean and comfortable with basic amenities and 24 hours hot water (they have solar heaters). Late in the evening, we were offered dinner (as asked for) and I must say it was very delicious, freshly cooked and served hot. Almost all vegetables are sourced from their organic farm overlooking the rooms.  The lodge offers both tents and room options. Both are equally good.

ladakh,We stayed in Nubra ecolodge for one night in May last week and regret that we should have stayed for longer. The property is located in Sumur and is away from the crowded tourist accommodation places in Hunder. The views from the property are breathtaking. I have posted some of the pictures to give an idea. The owner and staff are very hospitable and we were served very good food for all our meals. This is a new property which just opened this year.,bansal0408,/Profile/bansal0408,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",50

ladakh,"Nubra Ecolodge is situated in Nubra valley of Ladakh. Set against a background of beautiful trees, it gives a splendid view of the desert dunes. One can see the emerald green waters of Nubra river, slowly coursing along. Mr. Stenzin, the owner is a warm friendly person, very hands-on kind of owner, who explained the workings of his residence to us. He has a very talented cook, who makes lip-smacking delicacies with the fresh output from their greenhouse. They have a solar energy based hot water delivery system, which supplies hot water at the turn of a tap. Very impressive.",Shayin C,/Profile/Shayin,Mumbai,50

ladakh,"Our stay at Nubra is easily summarized in 2 words, ""too short"". I can easily imagine spending a week there enjoying the rugged mountain ranges, wandering between the shadows, along a meandering river . We had lovely weather, and the hospitality and food were excellent. Perfectly idyllic location, leading to a perfect vacation. One lazy morning, we even saw a hare bound across our deck.",anilpr0,/Profile/anilpr0,"Chennai, India",50

ladakh,"I stayed in the main building. The outlook was quite authentic, but entering inside the door, it was a ensuite bedroom with modern interior. Although it was during the off season, all the amenities, services in the brochure were provided. Impressive Ladakhi cuisines were served. Since this property is located at the vast field in the middle of Nubra valley, I was able to observe numerous starlight at night, marvellous mountain scape after sunrise. The staffs were kind and service-oriented and paid attention to security before sleep.",Joonhwan Park,/Profile/Joonpark,"Seoul, South Korea",50

Rooms/tents (this is the kind of ""tent"" that is pitched on a platform with an attached bath) are clean and comfortable, although they got a little hot during the day.

ladakh,"I went to this place in the first week of September with my husband and stayed there for a night. It was raining in Nubra Valley during that time and we reached late in the evening from Leh after visiting Hunder and Diskit Monastry (around an hour drive from here).   We were warmly greeted by the staff (Stenzing and a couple of others) and he guided us to our room and offered us tea/refreshments. The room and bathroom was very clean and comfortable with basic amenities and 24 hours hot water (they have solar heaters). Though it very cloudy and overcast, we managed to get running warm water.  After a couple of hours, we were offered dinner and I must say it was very delicious, freshly cooked and served hot.

Well, what more can you ask for?  The location of the ecolodge is breath-taking. Rivers, mountains, snow. trees, sand-dunes - everything in nature seems present here.  An amazing place.
