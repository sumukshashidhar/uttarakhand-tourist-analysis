ladakh,"Its a family run property and thats what makes it special . Its the personal touch and care that Norboo and his family provides that makes one's trip very very comfortable .  We stayed with them for 4 nights , they helped us with further bookings , guidance and in every other way they could.  Planning to visit again this year...and will definitely stay with them once again",nitin sukhija,/Profile/nitineshwar,,50
ladakh,"I stayed at Riboke for 2 weeks in June of 2018. I could not have asked for better accommodations. Norbu and his family are lovely and attentive hosts at this beautiful and clean guesthouse. Spectacular views of the surrounding landscape, the budding garden in early June, the proximity to all of what Leh has to offer made this guesthouse ideal for me. I will definitely go back and stay here on my next visit and have already recommended Riboke to friends who are traveling in Ladakh.  Thank you Norbu and family!",DCCFoley,/Profile/DCCFoley,,50
ladakh,"I stayed at Ribokeguest house for a week. During the initial stay, i got high altitude sickness and fever and things get quite bad. Im thankful thank i was very well taken care by the family.  Riboke guesthouse is just 5-7mins from Shanti stupa and 15-20mins walk to town. I will highly recommend this place for stay.",pigcess,/Profile/pigcess,Singapore,50

ladakh,"Happy to recommend on Riboke guesthouse / hotel in Leh. I stayed there for 10 days during May 2018 and enjoyed every moment. The place is well maintained, the rooms are clean, spacious and very welcoming. You have exactly what you need – hot water, wifi connection, peace and quiet, fresh air and privacy. The place has great view from each corner to beautiful fields and mountains, it is located in walking distance from the city center – giving quiet and peaceful atmosphere and easy access to the market, sightseeing or any other tourist attractions in the area. And – the people that run the place – amazing family that hosted me with big smile, they made me feel like I am one of them, made my experience at Leh so special – I have only good words to say on them and on their place.",Amir M,/Profile/AmirM1595,,50
ladakh,My experience here was amazing and very comfortable. The cleanliness was top class. amazing view and the silent atmosphere is refreshing.  the garden place and the ginger lemon tea was the best combination to start a morning. the ambiance is best maintained.  the family is too kind and very helpful. The best place to stay in LEH town.,prashanth k,/Profile/prashanthk378,,50
ladakh,"I've stayed here many times over the years and keep coming back. They have added several new rooms with attached bath as well as a big kitchen/dining/common room done in traditional style. Sadly, they have put a TV in there which spoils the ambience, as it seems to be on much of the time. Guests don't hang out there much, at least in the summer. There are one or two tables with some chairs in the garden, which is a much more popular place to sit around. The new building takes up much of the space that used to be a garden. The garden is organic, but mostly flowers, though there are a few vegetables, too, as well as apple and apricot trees. The view of the mountains is unobstructed and one of the best in the valley. And the family is very kind.",Peregrineri,/Profile/Peregrineri,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"We've spent a week in this place (with a stop for trekking in the middle), the owner saved us a room and was so kind! The rooms are very clean and cosy, feels like home! Views from the rooms are amazing!",Gal L,/Profile/12gall,,50
ladakh,"A place of relaxation, tranquillity and regeneration. We stayed for three days, and this was the optimal place to spend the time to get used to the altitude. The room (in the new building) was spaceful, light and clean, with our own separate bathroom. We had a wonderful view on the mountains surrounding Leh. The garden is simply marvellous, very well maintained. The family running the hotel is great: helpful and genuinely friendly. Definitely a recommendation!",Michael M,/Profile/michaelmV9214GM,"Vienna, Austria",50
ladakh,"We stayed here for three days in august. The family is very nice and helpful. They have very well maintained garden with flowers, apple and Apricot trees! we were allowed eat it as many as we wanted! ;). On request they serve ladakhi food also. A must place to stay when in Leh",Sandy764,/Profile/Sandy764,"Pune, India",50
ladakh,"We stayed at Riboke for 10days. And when we left it felt as if we were leaving our family. The guesthouse itself is beautiful, comfortable, exceptionally clean, great attention to detail, and has the nicest view and gorgeous gardens. The beautiful people who run it took care of us as if we were their own. When my mom got sick, they tended to all her needs, bringing tea/food etc to the hospital at all hours of day and night. Can't thank them enough for their generosity and hospitality.  And I must thank Amu for all her wonderful cooking!  Whenever we would go back to Leh we will stay only with them. Sending then love and best wishes. Shrinkhla",nanshri,/Profile/nanshri,nanshri,50
ladakh,"היינו כמעט שבוע בריבוק ופשוט אין מילה רעה אחת להגיד על המקום. הגינה יפייפיה, הנוף עוצר נשימה, חדרים גדולים ומצוחצחים מרגיש ממש כמו מלון. המשפחה שמנהלת את המקום ידאגו לכל צורך שלכם יחייכו ויעשו הכל באהבה. במהלך השהות שלנו במקום נאצלנו להגיע לביה""ח והמשפחה התעקשה להסיע אותנו ללוות אותנו בתהליך ולהישאר עד סוף הטיפול גם באמצע הלילה. We stayed at Riboke guest house for almost one week and there is just nothing bad to say about the place. The garden is beautiful, the view is breath taking, the rooms are big and clean and really feels like a good hotel rather then a guest house. During our stay we had to go to the hospital and the AMAZING family that runs the place insisted on taking us there and making sure we are getting the best treatment they didn't agree to leave until we got",Roey R,/Profile/roeyr2015,,50

ladakh,"I stayed at Riboke for 2 weeks with my partner and it was a perfect back to explore Leh and the Ladakh region. The family were very hospitable and friendly and assisted us with our every need. The room was clean, spacious, very comfortable and had beautiful sweeping views. I would definately recommend to stay here, it was a perfect experience for us, try the home made Ladakhi bread for breakfast!",Kim H,/Profile/kimh131,"Alice Springs, Australia",50
ladakh,The Positive s of this guesthouse are  A)Lovely Location B) Wonderful helping and carrying Hosts ever smiling. C) Bang in the Middle of Changspa Market. D) Clean  E)Great Value for Money  Negatives Well I struggle to find one but the approach road of last 50mts is not well lit from main road but that's hardly a negative.  If I go back to Leh this is the place I would stay again and again.  Thanks Norbu .  ,Meher999,/Profile/Meher999,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"I stayed Riboke for over 3 days in 2015 August when I did my cycling expedition in the ladakh region.  This is one place I would seriously recommend for people who want to stay in the centre of Leh. The price for the infrastructure the hotel offered was a steal. The place has a clear mountain view as well as of the Shanti Stupa. The people running it are extremely hospitable, very loving and always wanting to help you. Do not get disappointed by short narrow pathway to the hotel, once you enter it you will love it.",aadilmerchant,/Profile/aadilmerchant,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,"This place has been my home for a month this summer, only leaving for short treks in the beautiful Himalayas. If you are looking for a guest house in Leh you have to make it Riboke Guest house!! The family is so lovely and helpful, the breakfast with home made apricot jam and toast or bread is the best, and the rooms are comfortable and clean (two options: hotel-like rooms in the new building with your own bathroom, or very nice rooms in the first building with shared bathroom. I stayed in the old building and was very comfortable there). On top of that you get an amazing mountain view. I for sure will come back here. Note: the place is sometimes written differently, e.g. Ribook Guest house. Don't get confused, there is just this one, regardless of the spelling :)",atkka,/Profile/atkka,"Vienna, Austria",50
ladakh,It's a guest house but some rooms are really hotel leveled. The family is so nice and helpful! They took me to the hospital when I was sick and made me food! The beds are the most comfortable you can find in the area (I checked) and the place is very clean and well maintained. The prices are fair. I really enjoyed my stay there. I give a warm reccomendation for everyone to come and enjoy also. ,Shiran C,/Profile/636shiranc,"Yehud, HaMerkaz, Israel",50
