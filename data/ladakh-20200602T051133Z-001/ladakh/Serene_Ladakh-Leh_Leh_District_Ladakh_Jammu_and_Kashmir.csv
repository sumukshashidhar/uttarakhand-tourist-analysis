ladakh,"A good place to stay if you have private vehicle at your disposal. Not very well connect but if you decided to stay then you won't regret. Nice clean rooms, good food and polite staff. You should ask for rooms at lower floors as there are no lift and climbing 2-3 floors daily is not a good option when you are on vocation in Leh.",Ankur K,/Profile/190ankurk,"Lucknow, India",50

ladakh,"The place seemed new...the day we reached there was no electricity till evening. WiFi doesn't work in rooms, it only works in the reception and restaurant...that too wasn't working on 3 out of 5 days. There was no heating, no oxygen cylinder or emergency medicines. It felt more like someone's home. Food tasted good but was of limited variety. On the plus side staff was polite and helpful. And yes hot water was available 24*7. Also it was situated off the road so difficult to find.",shalinipatodiya,/Profile/shalinipatodiya,,20
