ladakh,"Stayed in Snow view ladakh for three days.The hotel is located 20 mins drive from the Leh airport.We checked in early in the morning ,and the rooms were ready during our arrival.Very homely place with personalized services. Rooms were very spacious neat and clean.Hot water was available throughout the day.They advised us to stay and rest in the room for one day so that we can get used to the altitude. Mr.David the MD of the hotel had given medication to our friends who were sick due to the altitude sickness.A very helpful person and knowledgeable person about leh and its surroundings. Food was served in the restaurant.Cozy place with friendly service.Food taste was amazing.Hats off to the chef and the service staff who took very good care of us.

ladakh,"Snow View hideaway is probably one of the few unique places in Leh which give you the feeling of being cut off from the city and noisy traffic and yet remains 5-10 minutes walking distance from the main market and cafes.  Surrounded by poplar trees and fields, the sound of chirping birds and rustling leaves mask the city’s jarring noise.  Our hosts, David and Naomi, are well known and respected in Ladakh. You’ll always find them willing to share off beat information about Ladakh and tips on travel. They also have a fantastic and rare collection of literature and books on the history of Ladakh and Tibet.  They go out of their way to make their guests feel comfortable.  The rooms are nice and warm with a fantastic balcony view offering the treeline view of Leh and snow peak",Jaskirat,/Profile/JaskiratSB,"Noida, India",50
ladakh,"The view was beautiful from the balcony, the popular trees, the mountains, the open space was amazing. The hospitality was wonderful. We stayed there four nights but it seemed less. It felt home away from home. The personal touch of Naomi and David was very touching. A memorable holiday spent at snow view. Shall definitely stay here, whenever we visit leh.",Anupma,/Profile/Anupmac19,,50
ladakh,"I stayed at the Snow View for 11 nights while volunteering and being a tourist in Leh. David and his wife Naomi could not have been more gracious and thoughtful during our stay. The staff was incredible - attentive and kind. The food was also terrific, and the setting can not be beat. It’s a 15 minutes walk to the main bazaar, or a 10 minute walk to Changspa Road. The Shanti Stupa is only a 20 minute walk (once you’re acclimated). David can help set up excursions or give suggestions for restaurants and shopping. It was truly a home away from home!

ladakh,"We had to be moved from another hotel where the service was not at all superb. And what a difference the staff at Snow View made to our time in Leh.   Welcoming, friendly,  always making that extra effort to make their guests feel comfortable. Nothing was too much trouble. Plenty of hot water for showers (unlike the other hotel), clean rooms, bathrooms, sheets and towels (unlike the other hotel). And Dilip's cooking is to die for especially his fried chicken.  There are not many places people stay where the guests learn the names of the staff, so it is a great big thank you to Dilip, James, Dorje, Naomi and Vilayat.  This is the best hotel we have stayed in, in Ladakh we can highly recommend it to all travellers in this part of the world. We met guests who have returned here",Giovanni-MacCormack,/Profile/Giovanni-MacCormack,United Kingdom,50
ladakh,"The way to the hotel was a great disaster but the hotel itself was a great living experience for me. We stayed there for 4 nights. Rooms are quite simple but for me, the view from the window was most important. The dining area, the chef, their staff members and the owner all were very nice people. (Specially Vilayat Khan). The food they served was very tasty. Overall my living experience in the hotel was amazing and whenever I go again Leh I would love to stay there only. :)",Dipti Goyal,/Profile/diptigoyal16,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
ladakh,"It's a really nice cosy and quite place, not too far from main market and not too close to be loud and crowdy. Rooms are good and airy thanks to big windows.  Food is awesome, during our stay we ate most of the time at hotel. Staff is also very polite and humble people. There's an alley at Hotel's back side which will lead you straight to Changspa Road just 5 mins walk and there's a river stream as well on the way where you can sit and relax. Garden ares is also quite good as well with lot's of Apple trees. Wifi works around reception and garden area only.

I enjoyed superb service, very clean and cosy rooms in a homely atmosphere and - great view into the Stok mountains is included. Food is excellent and if you are interested in wildlife David the owner is always at hand with helpful tips and interesting stories.

Surrounded by lovely flowers and apple trees, its the perfect place to collect your breath.

ladakh,"Kudos to Naomi & David Sonam, who have made their hotel into a large home. When one reaches Leh by flight from Delhi, at 10,500 ft, one feels uncomfortable shortly after. It is in this hotel people are taken care of very well. Both Naomi & David, along with their manager and staff of the hotel starts telling guests of precautions they need to follow. If there is a kid in the group, he/ she is engaged in indoor games to ensure that the kid doesn't feel bored, nor does the kid over exert himself/ herself and then get hit by AMS (Acute Mountain Sickness), a common phenomenon among visitors in Leh.

David and Naomi were simply wonderful hosts who gave us some very helpful tips on things to do in Ladakh including acclimatisation, riding routes and other places to visit.

The hotel is well located, and restaurants, shops, markets etc are a short walk away.

The food is excellent, many fresh vegetables coming from their large garden daily tended by David's 83 year old mother.  The flowers are lovely.   I have stayed at the Snow View 3 times over the past 5 years and look forward to another visit.  It is comfortable in every way.  As a solo traveler, I feel very welcome and safe there.

Very nicely maintained, spacious rooms (new hotels doesn't provide you spacious rooms), balconie view,  tasty food (they also provide Jain food).

The food is delicious with great authentic cuisines being served, and one can even ask for special orders from the restaurant.  The rooms are great and if you travel solo and want to save money, you can even get the cheaper ones, although I liked the one with the balcony more.",Arnav G,,,50

The service and food is wonderful - and David is a fount of knowledge about everything Ladakhi.  One time my son had a head injury while biking down from Khardungla, and it was first David, then Naomi and the staff who personally helped us through the ordeal of the hospital and then care at 'home'.  Simple, gentle, generous people run Snow View. This is the ONLY place to stay. Go on, try it, and then tell me I was right !",WhiteTiger2010,,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50

I had talked to my friends regarding the place best to stay at Ladakh and most of them suggested David Sonam. The set up from my side was done few months back and my realisation came true when I first met him. David Sonam, owner of Snow View hotel, really a humble guy, a nature lover, a trekker!! what else I don't know. Yes another thing, he who has no affinity to money. I am an avid birder, so I approached to him to have few pointers on birding hotspots in the region. As per his suggestion we achieved a bag full within 4 days of our stay.

Now for the details:  We did not book this place by ourselves. Our travel agent had done the booking for us.

But when you spend a few more days in Leh you realise that its a very cheap city to holiday and for 1/3 the price you get much better Guest Houses/ Hotels.   Snow View charged a bomb for the food which was truly pathetic and the service was bad (We had to ask for water 5 times) you will get much better food in most other Ladakhi GH / Home stays/ B&Bs.

Everything about it is welcoming, friendly, attentive, relaxed and peaceful. This is all down the owners and staff – hailing variously from Ladakh, Kashmir and Rajasthan – who are attentive yet unobtrusive. Nothing seems too much trouble and the absence of ‘rules’ (‘dinner at 8pm’, ‘checkout time: noon’, ‘no handwashing’ etc) make for a wonderfully relaxing stay.  On arrival we were met by the charming co-owner, Naomi, and sitting in the flowery garden, under umbrellas, we began to sense the hotel’s uniqueness.
