ladakh,These wooden cottages are one of the best non-tended accommodation available for stay in Pangong. It was recommended to me by our taxi driver (Konchuk - 9622981126) who was very helpful during my complete trip. Food was especially good and warm water was available on request. Adequate blankets were also provided as it gets quite cold in night. Would recommend this for stay in pangong.,Ritish Singla,/Profile/ritishs,,50

ladakh,"Staying in the Himalayan Wooden Huts has been one of the best experiences in a remote place like Pangong. First of all, the entire staff was very humble, courteous and friendly. Secondly, the rooms are very clean, cosy and had all the basic amenities.The huts are located just  adjacent to the mighty Pangong Lake and therefore the view from the large glass windows is superb and amazing be it morning, afternoon or  evening.They provided home like food and never refused tea, hot water etc.We loved the location of this Property and would stay here whenever we plan to re-visit Pangong Lake.",s_Worldtraveller,/Profile/s_Worldtraveller,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"Visited this hell hole, PROVIDED BY OYO  on 10th july 2018, beds were smelly , towel had  stains on it, as there was no water some previous traveller has used it is as toilet paper, Bath room has only one soiled bucket which one has to use for all bodily functions as well as bathing. AVOID ANY PACKAGE BY OYO . WHENEVER YOU BOOK A PACKAGE THROUGH OYO ALWAYS SEE ACTUAL UTUBE VIDEOS TO KNOW THE FRAUD COMPANY VERY WELL",dinesh s,/Profile/dineshs1808,,10

ladakh,These are wooden cottages much better than camps. Very clean rooms and bathrooms with modern fittings. We did not expect this at this location. People are very humble. Then came the surprise when we sat for dinner. It was proper 3 course meal with delicious dishes. Beyond our expectations. Highly recommended. ,AlkaAmit,/Profile/AlkaAmit,"Faridabad, India",50
ladakh,Had visited pangong in last week of May  This is a very comfortable place to stay. Avoid staying in camps. Its intolerable due to subzero temperatures and gushing winds. Also still if you booking camp 10 times more option available as compared to what seen on MMT or Goibibo. So directly book there  Hotel is clean. Hot water available. It was far more than expected. Clean rooms. Dinner and Breakfast unlimited buffet.   How to book : No net in pangong so this cottage was not available on Make my trip or any app as cottage doesn't get information because of no internet. Instead you have to contact Mrs Sonam who mostly take calls between 7 am to 9 am as no network rest of day usually(contact no 09469534870) and transfer minimum amount as requested to bank. ,Chandresh K,/Profile/chandreshk2016,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"The rooms are small ply-wood cabins, so we found it quite the task to stay warm in -10 weather. There was electricity only for a couple of hours a day, so we had to warm up and charge our phones quite fast. The night though was bitter cold (so cold that the bucket of water and the towel had frozen solid)  On a brighter note, it's quite close to the lake and the food at this hotel was delicious! The staff were also very hard working and helpful and provided buckets of hot water. Make sure you check on the weather before booking.",HanimA A,/Profile/hanimaa,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",20
ladakh,The rooms are made of plywood and hence the name. The property is situated a bit far from the lake (10-15 mins walk) but still you can have a clear view of the lake from the cottages. The staff is helpful and courteous. The food also did justice. The bathrooms are a bit small and hot water is available only in buckets the taps run dry in morning due to the extreme cold weather at night. However they will provide you with adequate blankets but as an improvement they should make arrangements for keeping the rooms warmer.  This property is average so I would suggest you to look out for some better options around the vicinity. ,Akash_Topdar,/Profile/Akash_Topdar,"New Delhi, India",30
ladakh,Arrived here late by accident without booking and was welcomed by very friendly and helpful staff. Food was excellent and a lot of it. Views of the lake are exceptional. Enough warm duvets and blankets provided. Room and bathroom were very clean. Definitely recommended. ,laura l,/Profile/M2004OVlaural,"Lyon, France",50
ladakh,We reached around 1:00 am but staff was very helpful. They arranged hot food and tea at such late hours. Food was also very good as compared to other places we have tried in Leh. It has very nice lake view as well.,Mansi A,/Profile/612mansia,"Pune, India",40
ladakh,Place is near to panagong lake.2 mins away..They serve good food.Blankets are enough to beat the chilling cold. Camp fire is made available on request. staff is friendly and helpful..bathrooms are neat and clean and properly equipped.,saurabh gupts,/Profile/saurabhg807,,40
ladakh,"Dreamland wooden cottage was one of the remotest places we stayed in throughout our Leh bike trip. To this property's credit, it was the best food we had during the 14 days we were on the road. The cottage is basic with a bed and some lights (which are turned on after 7 pm in the evening centrally).  We reached in the evening and took the breakfast and dinner included option. It was the best spread we had seen in a long time with the cook (Pappu from Nainital) preparing some amazingly cooked dishes. Got soup and dessert in the dinner which was not expected. The coffee tasted brilliant. Good food always lifts our spirits and this is what we needed after driving in snowfall for most part of the day. Will stay here again the next time I am at Pangong. ",warrioraks,/Profile/warrioraks,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,Location is very good. Food was good too. Staff is courteous and they help in all possible ways.   There was problem with hot running water so they provided it separately in a bucket. Signal was very weak. The host gave his mobile to call at home.   This place is recommended to stay. ,Prateek Jalan,/Profile/JalanPrateek,"Kolkata, India",40
ladakh,"Mainly known by the name Dream Land Wodden Cottage. Preferring cottages in comparison to tents at pangong is a good idea as in night the weather can be too cold and also the clean cottages with attached washroom is advantage. Food provided in this cottage was too good. Didn't except this kind of delicious food in this area. Got the best in my overall Ladakh trip. Hotel staff was friendly, polite and always willing to assist.  Hot water is supplied in buckets but they provide as many buckets as you want. Normal water is always running in taps.  They also provided 2 hot water bags and hot water to drink as and when required.",Varun B,/Profile/bhatia_varun,"Allentown, Pennsylvania",50
ladakh,"We stayed at this place in April during our visit to Hanging lake. The beauty of the lake is such that you tend to give little importance to anything else. The moment you reach there the different shades of blue mesmerizes you. However, don't get mistaken by the name. These cottages are regular plywood cottages and in the freezing weather around the lake, the nights can get very uncomfortable. The rooms are cosy and good enough to accommodate at best a couple. Anything more than that would be a crowd. The conditions are very tough as in the morning the water was frozen and not flowing in the taps. The dinner spread was decent and so was the taste. The breakfast also was above average. An extra star for the location.",kartik N,/Profile/514kartikn,"Bangalore District, India",40
ladakh,"Small wooden camp with neat cozy room and bathroom. The location is good, the best part is, given it is May, and given it is windy, the cottages offer good resistance. A lot of folks who stayed in tents moved to the place within few hours due to the weather. The folks who run the place are friendly, they offered extra blankets and hot packs, their restaurant had a heater, and they served good buffet food. I would recommend this place to folks planning to stay at Spangmik. There are a couple concrete buildings that may offer better resistance, but this place was actually pretty balanced to give you a feeling of different accommodation and at the same time not too windy and cold inside.",Arun DK,/Profile/dkarun,Hyderabad,50
ladakh,"We visited Pangong in Sep, hence it was not very crowded. We reached Spangmik by evening and managed to get a cabin at Himalayan. The price was reasonable and lesser than some other cabins and tented accommodations nearby. As others have stated it is a bit away from the lake, around 3-4 mins by walk. But most other properties also are not exactly by the lake, so it was not an issue. The wooden cottage keeps the cold away a little better than the tents, so we didn't mind that at all. The cabin was smallish like most are but sufficient. The bathroom however was too small and any water spilt on the bathroom floor would flow into the bed area. The host was very friendly and took good care. Food options were quite decent. I particularly liked the hot soup during dinner, feels good in",Praks_blr,/Profile/Praks_blr,Bangalore,30
ladakh,"Stayed in Sept 2016 for 1 Night. The place is in Spangmik village 6KM Ahead of the 3 Idiots shooting spot. The Cottages are ~200Mts from the Lake. You can see the lake from all the cottages.Nights are very cold in Pangong and it really helped us from cold. Food was very tasty. Power is available for 4Hrs during night 6-10PM(same with all the camps in pangong) They have a emergency Lamp which helps duing night. Hot water would be provided in Buckets on request. Overall very happy with the service and would love to stay back. Pros: Being wodden cottage helps against cold. cons: a little far from lake ~200-250mt from Lake, the Tents are very close to lake ~50mt, but may not help you fight the cold in sept-oct months",Girish N,/Profile/girish_nandibasappa,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,This is a nice place to stay if you want to avoid the tent and stay in wodden cottage. It's not exactly on the lake but a bit away on height. So one has to take a 10-15 minute walk to reach to lake. The best part was their food which I loved.,ImDrMD,/Profile/ImDrMD,India,40
ladakh,"Name of cottage : Himalayan Wooden Cottage , Panggong lake  Highly Recommended. Should appreciate these guys for maintaining this kind of cottage in the remote location.

ladakh,"With an ultimate view of pangong lake, this cottage provided us very comfortable stay. Camps were about to set up because season dint started yet. So we chosen to stay in himalayan wooden cottages. Owner lady provided us hot water immediately along with hot tea/coffee. We booked 4 cottages. It was super chilling, approx -6 deg C. but because of nice blankets we were able to stand in that cold night. Food was basic but tasty and nice. Thanks for those hot soup. Morning view was just great. Best place to stay in pangong. Definitely a must try.",Lalbahadur,/Profile/Lalbahadur,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"We have stayed at Himalayan Wooden Cottages as Camps are withdrawn due to cold winds. Hospitality, food and service are quite good. Hot water is provided in sub zero temperature. Hot water bags gives protection from cold above benefit of wooden walls against chilled winds. Pangong Tso is just in front of door and windows. Sunrise is great to watch.",Chirayu3,/Profile/Chirayu3,"Vadodara, India",50
