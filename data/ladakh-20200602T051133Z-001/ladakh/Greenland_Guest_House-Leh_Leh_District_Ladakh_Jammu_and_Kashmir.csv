ladakh,"I stayed in Leh for a month, going on various trips, but always back to this guesthouse when in Leh. It was clean, nicely run, the lady owner always trying her best to keep everyone satisfied and in general just a quiet place to relax. Will definitely come back here and recommend it hightly to everyone. ",sschmidiger,/Profile/ssmile2019,"Lucerne, Switzerland",50
ladakh,"We stayed here on our way through from Srinigar heading to Leh.  It is such a beautiful and relaxed building, with a great roof.  It has a real feel of remoteness to it and is quite literally in the shadow of the monastery, whilst being no more than a 10 minute walk from the outstanding moon crater mountains.   There is an incredibly relaxed atmosphere at the Greenland Guest House.  The value for money was just incredible, the evening meal we had was one of the best we had during our trip - and so much of it. The food didn't stop coming!  Definitely a great place to stay!",Will S,/Profile/willsK4971MN,,50
ladakh,"We stayed here more than half a month, the lady is very nice, she also cooked breakfast and dinner for us,and helped us to decide where we should go. We like Leh and the people here, it's not like India. ",Yan Yan C,/Profile/847yanyanc,,50
ladakh,"We stayed at Greenland this June 2017.  Yangchen and her son are very warm and  hospitable . The place is a traditional Ladakhi home and absolutely clean..  We had endless chats and cups of tea with the owner in her kitchen whilst she prepared wholesome breakfast with the local handmade khambir bread.  We met guests here who have been staying at Greenland every time they visit Leh.On our last day there Yanchen went out of her way to make us some fresh salad from her garden, even though it was raining and she was ill.  That was so very special and kind of her.  Thankyou Yangchen and Stanzen.",Jane F,/Profile/JaneF2510,,50
ladakh,"It was many years ago that I stayed at Greenland Guest House, back before there was a TripAdvisor ‚Äì or, indeed, an Internet. But this home made such an impression on me that I have thought of my two-month stay here many times over the years. Back in the autumn of 1992, you could arrive in Leh, walk through the neighboring village of Changspa, and take your pick from among the homes with a ‚Äúroom for rent‚Äù sign in the window. When I knocked on the door of Greenland Guest House, it was Yangchan who greeted me, and she kindly showed me to a beautiful, sunny corner room on what was then the top floor (I see they have since added another level to the house). From that moment, I was treated more like a family member than a customer. I dined most nights with Yangchan, her husband",MarkHawthorne,/Profile/MarkHawthorne,"Rohnert Park, California",50
ladakh,"Now that I have stayed at Greenland I could never stay anywhere else in Leh, and I would not wish to.   Yangchen, Yangchen and Stanzin are wonderful, caring, and considerate proprietors who do whatever they can to make the stay comfortable. When I first visited them, Stanzin was a funny and amusing little boy - and his father Norbu was still alive; Norbu was one of the great unsung heroes of Ladakh and India.   Writing this review brings tears to my eyes because I love them so much and Ladakh is so far away, and I have rabbits to look after so it is much harder to travel for me.  Every morning Yangchen makes a simple but delicious breakfast, freshly made roti with omelette, or with home-made apricot jam and locally sourced butter.  Nearly every evening, there is a simple",Ben G,/Profile/bengZ7629UQ,,50
ladakh,Yangchen aunty is a caring and knowledgeable owner who makes all her guests feel at home. She even arranged for a taxi for our tour in Leh. The room we stayed in had an amazing view and was quite warm and comfy. The tea room is a great place to meet fellow travelers and share stories. Her mint tea and apricot jam is to die for. ,Bhaswati B,/Profile/bhaswatibora,"Guwahati, India",40
ladakh,"I stayed there two months ago. we have booked 3 rooms on phone call. mr. stanzin settled the amount with me two months ago from the date of booking. he told me that he is the owner  & he didn't want any advance amount & your booking is confirmed. since then i had 3-4 conversation with him ,every time he replied me sir, your booking is confirmed when we reached this guest house we met mrs. yangchen, mother of mr. stanzin .she told me that she is the actual owner of the guest house & mr.stanzin is nothing & rate settled with him is not correct, she was asking us for double the amount as settled with stanzin after a huge bargaining we paid her the total amount as per her choice as we didn't have any other option because of peak season. .

ladakh,"The Ladhaki owner of this guest house makes all the difference. She is thoughtful, knowledgeable and caring. Makes all the difference! Her ""tea room"" is a great place to socialize. The rooms have a feel of sufficient comfort and economy. ",xvivek,/Profile/xvivek,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,We stayed there for 2 days. We felt like at being home. The lady owner is very friendly and helpful. The location is very well connected to Leh market and there are very good restaurants and cafe near by. The only downside is that they have shared bathrooms.,Viral,/Profile/808virals,,50

ladakh,"Greenland is a large traditional Ladakhi guesthouse up the popular Chungspa road. The rooms are simple but clean, very homely and bathed in natural light. The proprietress is very friendly, welcoming and speaks very good English. The house is surrounded in garden and provides lovely shaded seating to relax in. It's only a short walk down Chungspa road to where all the cafes, shops and travel agents. We would highly recommend it.",Che H,/Profile/998cheh,,50
ladakh,we have stayed here for six days. One of the best Guest house of Leh and that too on main Changspa road very near to shanti stupa and many restaurants.Rooms are clean with beautiful views. Our room was really big. Clean water to fill up. Madam Yangchan is very kind woman always guide us for the best places to visit and to eat in whole ladakh. we surely miss Mint tea and ladakhi roti with appricot jam from her kitchen. I have booked this guest house on phone  after reading reviews on tripadviser and we are glad that we did also there is no online booking option available.Highly recommended.,Mayuri123_nit,/Profile/Mayuri123_nit,"Hyderabad, India",50
ladakh,"This was the best guest house that I think I have ever stayed in (yes, that's quite a statement).   The rooms are clean and comfy, as are the bathrooms living space downstairs. I'm pretty sure that all of the rooms have great views. And as a single traveller it was really super having the single room - yes it's quite small but it had a beautiful view of the gompa across the mountain and it was the cosiest, comfiest. The double rooms are really big.  Anyway, the best part of the whole guest house is Yunchen and her family. It really is like a home away from home. Do ask for dinner and breakfast (sometimes pancakes, sometimes traditional ladakhi bread with *homemade* apricot jam and omelet, dinner is always great too). I don't think that there is anywhere nicer for a meal in town.",Nettlekm,/Profile/Nettlekm,,50

ladakh,"My husband, my son and I stayed in this hostel in August 2015. I'm glad that TripAdvisor has included it, because it is a very special place. I recommend it to people who want to learn more about the ladakhi people people because the owner, Madam Yangchen is a strong and wise ladakh woman who gave us good advice for travel around the region and see beautiful places, and she also makes an excellent apricot jam. The place is simple but clean. Walking in 15 minutes you get to the center of Leh. In front of the hostel there are restaurants where you can have breakfast or lunch. We want to come back to this place, we miss Madam Yangchen. Another thing, if you are wanting to withdraw from the world and write a book, this is the best place to do it.",jordana652,/Profile/jordana652,"Vilnius, Lithuania",50
ladakh,"I stayed there in August 2015 and had a wonderful time.  Clean place, lovely landlady, good breakfast and dinner on request. The prices are very fair and the concept of the place being a green and ecological place makes it a good address in Leh.",Dominik B,/Profile/dominikb451,,50
ladakh,"I m so glad to see Tripadvisor finally accepted an entry for Greenland. I stayed here in August 2014, after a friend recommended the place. Nice and clean rooms and shared bathrooms, great fresh local food, water refill, wifi, very welcoming and sociable atmosphere - since everyone has dinner together. I was here both solo and with friends, definitely recommended for solo travellers. Also met some very inspiring long term Himalaya-travellers who had been coming here for years. The lovely Yanchen is the most wonderful host you can imagine. On top of all that, you're spending your money with a local Ladakhi ( as opposed to many new entrants setting up business here). Highly recommended!",Sigrid L,/Profile/siel,"Brussels, Belgium",50
ladakh,"Greenland homestay is located in lower changspa, 3 to 4 mins walk from Shanti Stupa opposite to Cafe d Leh. Budget homestay, highly recommended for backpackers and solo travelers. The lady owner is a wonderful lady, one of the most humble, caring and loving people i met during my trip to leh in September 2015. i stayed at her place for 12 days. She makes the most amazing breakfast and sipping the tea in the garden infront of the house is indeed a beautiful experience. She helped me plan my trip and introduced me to other travelers staying there.. The rooms are very spacious and clean. Property is well maintained and free wifi is also available. I would recommend Greenland homestay to all the fellow travelers looking for a budget accommodation and trust me you will not regret it.",Gunjita B,/Profile/gunjitab,,50
ladakh,"I visited leh in July 2015 for my bike ride in laddakh. This is a budget homestay. The lady owner of the guest house is very humble and honest.  Rooms - Clean, comfortable, spacious, clean and warm quilts. Very well maintained property. We all git a very peaceful sleep here. Food - Nice tea/breakfast.  Hospitality - The lady owner is very good person. She helped us with tips to get acclimatized with high altitudes. She suggested us for good food places, bike hiring spots and recommendations. And all of this was honest with no commercial aspect associated with it. She even gave us 6 Jerry cans for petrol for our 5 day ride.  Definitely recommended for budget accommodation.",Dipesh B,/Profile/dipeshb2013,Pune,40
ladakh,"- Visited last year. - It's run by a hard working lovely hosbitable woman called Yangchen. - Awesome room, superawesome hospitability. - Neat and clean toilets. - She makes non spicy food for foreigners and foreigners from other guest houses also come to have dinner at this place. - Slow Wifi. - Beautiful view and is located close to Leh market in Changspa. - Most of the time the places is fully occupied. - Once I came back from a two day trip and it was my last night in Leh. Unfortunately, she had no place and she offered me to sleep in the hall. Next day she was not accepting any money from me for the same night. It wasn't surprising because she treated everyone as her family at her place. In the end I bought enough cookies for his son. - I highly recommend this place to",Anupamghildiyal85,/Profile/Anupamghildiyal85,"New Delhi, India",50
