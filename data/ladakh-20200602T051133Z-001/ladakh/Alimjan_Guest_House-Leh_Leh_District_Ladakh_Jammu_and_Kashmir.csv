ladakh,"We were 2 couples travelling. We were taken to this place by our local friend. The initial meeting itself was very warm with Mr Bashir-the owner. What followed was a comfortable and enjoyable stay over the 5 nights that we spent there. Its located in a tiny by-lane on the Fort Road along with a cluster of several guesthouses opposite Hotel Mandala. Its close to the bustling market and yet away from the noise. The rooms and bathrooms are basic yet clean with hot running water. They offer simple complimentary breakfast and lunch or dinner on prior request. They were very accommodating to give us packed breakfast early morning on days that we were scheduled to leave for long distance trips. They offered us an excellent off-season rate suitable to our budget. Ali, is the go-to man",poojamunshi00,/Profile/poojamunshi00,"Mumbai, India",40
