ladakh,"I wouldn’t recommend staying here - due to the manager who doens’t understand how to set customer expectations, and meet these. The staff however were great.  -The rooms and amenities- The rooms are comfortable, clean. Toilets are Western and clean.  Hot water is unpredictable - although we asked twice whether there was hot water (and we were told there was a geyser and solar heating), we didn’t receive hot water during our stay until the last day, after raising this a number of times. There was no apology from the manager Rajat. He said we should tell him when to switch the geyser on - something he never mentioned to us before (and given we’re not mind readers, we should be told upfront).  We also had problems accessing wifi - in that it wasn’t working. Rajat kindly let us",Neha D,/Profile/nehad852,,20

ladakh,the owner of the hotel was very rude. They charged 500 rs extra and upon asking the same confronted upon it. They donot know how to talk to customers as the owner herself rudely asked us to leave the hotel upon small altercation over the bill which they agreed at last.,Sanjay J,/Profile/SanjayJ710,,10
