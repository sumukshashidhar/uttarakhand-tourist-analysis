ladakh,"we stayed in this guest house in merak village  on the day we visited pangong tso. The guest house is simple, very clean and affordable. There are some rooms with attached bath and some with common bath. We stayed in a double bed room with attached bath. The bathroom is clean with modern facilities. Hot water for drinking and bath is available separately as and when you require. Extra blankets are available upon request. The guest house lady is very helpful. The best part of the guest house is the dinning area where ladakhi style small wooden tables coloured in red and blue are kept and the floor is carpeted. You can get the real feel of ladakh while you sip the hot butter tea .The dinning hall has big class windows from where you can view the snowclad mountains.We saw the lady",jdgupta,/Profile/insearchofmyself,"Kolkata, India",40
ladakh,"The guest house is exactly as shown in the pics. The care taker lady was very courteous & provided prompt service. She served tea, as soon as we checked-in. Dinner & breakfast was included in our booking. Dinner had salad, roti, Kaali daal & phool gobi aloo curry. It was very tasty & homely. Breakfast had bread toast, omelette & chai. There was one room with shared bathroom & 2 rooms with attached bathroom. Our room had attached bathroom. The last provided hot water whenever we asked for. Very memorable stay at this quaint village!",Sunita,/Profile/SunitaMandal,"Hyderabad, India",40

ladakh,"We still talk about our memorable stay in remote Merek at this homely guesthouse. The hospitality was amazing, the food hearty and simple. I still remember sitting in the cosy kitchen with the stove alight, digging into that delicious dinner. And if u are into star gazing this is just the perfect place for that. Although the amenities were basic it added to the charm of the remote n the rustic. I look forward to returning to this place again sometime soon.",RoopJee,/Profile/RoopJee,"Hyderabad, India",50
ladakh,We were six people(2 couples)who stayed at this beautiful place of Merak and were surprised to see the hospitality given to us. Hot water was available and good homemade food made our day.

ladakh,"Good stay in lap of mother nature. Village Merak is on banks of Pangong Tso. and almost 11 kms away from crowded villages spangmik & man. Roads are somewhat tough but when you reach there, It's worth it. The owner Mr. Dorjay is a very gentle and friendly person.",Nahush B,/Profile/716nahushb,"Ahmedabad, India",50
ladakh,"A family run guest house situated in village Merak on the edge of Pangon Tso. Approximate 20 KM from the starting point of the lake and you will drive next to the edge of pangon almost all thru the way till you reach Merak.  Now comes the place, its a guest house with 3 or 4 well maintained rooms with all basic amenities. You will get the good home cooked food. The place is powered with solar energy. We booked a one night stay there but later realize that it was too short to enjoy the place at its best. The full moon view of the place and surrounding mountains were breath taking and instead of subzero temp. we were out and capturing those moments in our camera. As they say.. its all about journey and not destination, but here the destination was equally beautiful and scenic. I",Crzy_Couple_on_D_Go,/Profile/Crzy_Couple_on_D_Go,,50
