ladakh,"I don't know whether there are rooms with attached bathrooms. For me, I was using the common toilet. The tiny room was convenient enough for a single person, and above all, neat and tidy.  Ideal for the budget solo backpacker who wants a single room for his own,",RamTham,/Profile/RamTham,"Trivandrum, India",30
ladakh,"The male receptionist in this small hotel was terribly inhuman. While booking, he started demanding my aadhar card. I gave him my voter id as I didn't have aadhar and all hotels in Leh ask for Voter id. He started crying saying that voter ids have been declared as useless so only aadhar works. Also, while we were checking in, he in a warning and insulting tone said, do not stay even one minute extra in the hotel after 12 noon (check out time), else u will pay for it. Our Leh to Srinagar bus was at 2 PM. We did check out at 12 noon next day, and we had to sit on the stairs outside the hotel. He again came out crying and wailing that please go somewhere, visit something, but don't stay anywhere near to his sad hotel. He clearly suffered from some severe mental agony.
