ladakh,This review is for 3rd week of November stay.  We did on the spot booking for one double bed and one twin rooms with double bed for 8 adults. The kitchen was closed. Property is neat and clean. Heater for whole night and 24 hrs hot water was a lottery. We had traveled from Leh to Kargil War Memorial and wanted to stay for a night and then return to Leh. So for a night stop hotel is okay. Considering most of the hotels in town are closed we got overpriced deal.  Hotel is in main market. Few restaurants are at walking distance. No specific view from the rooms. But roof top gives a good mountain view.,Rajanish T,/Profile/JajaborRaj,"Pune District, India",30
ladakh,"The location is good and the building is new from the outer appearance. When we firstly took a look of the room, the sheet on the bed was not clean and it seems that it had been a long time without visitors. (Maybe because of off-season) After our complaint, the staff changed another room for us. The room rate was 3000 for 4 people in one room. Hot shower was available but my friend who bathed late at night without hot shower. The WiFi is not workable in the room, but only work at the first floor. The breakfast is 200RS per person while tea, toasts and egg only. It is expensive to have such food in India. ",michelleinthejourney,/Profile/michelleinthejourney,"Tainan, Taiwan",20
ladakh,"We were here on a biking expedition this June and had an overnight stopover. The hotel is placed in the center of the this bustling town. Not much really around to choose in terms of location. Decent parking space. The rooms really need attention of the owners, as they are damp and smelly. The linen wasn't washed and the staff is arrogant if you request them to change. The food and service staff was quite though.",TeamAspen,/Profile/TeamAspen,Rishikesh,20
ladakh,"Location : Bang on the Srinagar-Leh highway in the middle in Kargil Market. One can find lots of shops including daily needs and medical stores around.  Rooms: Deluxe Rooms were not so spacious but were clean with clean bathrooms as well. Clean towels were provided. Being on the highway, one can constantly hear little noises of horns and engines of trucks and vehicles moving through the highway. Tata Sky was not working and some problem in the bathroom as well but Mr.Musa Ali at the front desk addressed the issues promptly.  WiFi was working but was quite slow.  Food & Service: A bit oily but food was good to taste, and proper attention was provided for the needs. During the breakfast though the waiter offered us a very limited breakfast options to which we called the Kitchen",ARPIT S,/Profile/ArpitSeth,"New Delhi, India",30

ladakh,"We stayed one night, on way to Ladakh. The property is nice, rooms are new and they have nice roof top sitting area. Royal rooms, staff is helpful.Food is good. Restaurant is nice, with a funny washroom :-D. Wifi was not working, as the ISP link was down and it doesnt work in the rooms.  Only one negative - No Intercom. If you need room service, u gotta call out for the help.  Otherwise nice stay.",Vivek G,/Profile/549vivekg,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"One night stay on the way to Leh From Sonmarg. A group of Five persons booked two rooms. Mr. Ali the manager there is very accommodating, as we were on amarnath  yatra and not sure about the dates.  The property is is in the center of town. Next day being Eid whole of the town was closed.  The rooms were nice. The bathroom which did not have any ventilation  had a peculiar odor of dampness. one of the bathroom was nice as it was well ventilated.",spaciba75,/Profile/spaciba75,"Ludhiana, India",40
ladakh,"Its among the best hotels in kargil. Though still not upto the mark. But there is no other option.  Food is very good. Staff is very nice. Rooms are clean and small. Bed is not very comfortable. Bathrooms are ok, not really clean. ",vabygroup,/Profile/vabygroup,"Noida, India",30
ladakh,"Hotel was good for overnight stay. Food was just ok. No room service phone made things a bit difficult. Since kargil is at height of around 12000 ft, need to take care for health due to less oxygen. Hotel is near to market. Hence you can replenish your neccessities.",rajesh0204,/Profile/rajesh0204,"Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia",40
ladakh,"If you are going to leh by road via srinagar then you have to halt at Kargil. And you can not have a better place for a night halt. It is definitely the best in town. Considering Kargil a small town, PC Palace is amazingly well built and kept. It is really clean and hygienic and the food is good too.",tarun2112,/Profile/tarun2112,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"New Hotel small Rooms very small washroom. Rooms on 2 floor are big but very expensive, the staff is new or maybe first time in the hospitality job didn't know how to look and talk to customers feels bit Uncomfortable when u are with family , bedding was clean. They disturbed me twice in night, once to get my car park outside as they have new guest in 2 cars who are not ready to park there car outside and hotel have parking for 2cars only, and secondly after half an hour for menu card as they have only one card.  As there were not many guests in the hotel we didn't had do dinner so can't say about food  Try other options there are many nearby",shuja khan,/Profile/shujakhan365,"Meerut, India",20
