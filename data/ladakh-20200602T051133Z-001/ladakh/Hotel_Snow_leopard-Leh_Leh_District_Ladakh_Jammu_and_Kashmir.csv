ladakh,"The entire place is basically falling apart. When we reached the hotel a sand storm just started so we could not go out. Instead we (my husband and myself) sat at the end of the dining room staring at the outside view. The whole floor lamination started flopping around with the wind. The construction quality was poor even for India. The manager Mithun started bringing a thermos full of something for some guests for room service. When he entered the dining room from the kitchen, the bottom of the thermos fell off. It is really a wonderful metaphor for the hotel. That evening and next morning with horror we watched the total lack of sanitation in the dining room. The sugar that was spilled on the DIRTY, SANDY serving area was swept back in the server, the dirty cloth started",Purobi,/Profile/Purobi,San Francisco,10

The rooms were spacious  and comfortable  . Best part was continuous supply of hot water which is luxury in Ladakh.

The uncle who looked after the garden was very friendly. He always came to greet us and even gave us apples from the garden to try. I forgot my bag and wallet inside in the dinning room for 1 hour.

ladakh,"We visited Nubera in early May 2019 and we were a group of 4 friends. We stayed for a night in this Hotel and here is my opinion :   Pros :   1. Location of the hotel is really great. Its located centrally and surrounded by great views of the mountain.  2. Staff is helpful and hospitality is good.  3. A lot of space for parking & drivers are logged without any cost 4. Hotel compound is awesome with a lot of trees.  5. Rooms are spacious and we were provided a corner room which had a great balcony and view from 2 sides.  6. Biggest Advantage:- If you are lucky to get clear sky at night, you can observe the breathtaking view of Milky Way and do some Astrophotography but watch out for temperature.

Snow Leopard is one of the better options as there is room for bargain and you may land a good deal as I did.   Its a budget hotel in every sense.

Mattresses are hard, insufficient lighting, discoloured buckets. The hotel and the rooms are clean though. Food is really average with limited choices.

I do not have anything to compain about this hotel. The room was adequately big with clean washroom and a lovely balcony. The dinner as well as breakfast was ample in quantity and tasty.

The rooms do get cold which could be especially unhealthy for young kids accustomed to warmer weather and with their naturally,SridharCanada,/Profile/SridharCanada,"Toronto, Canada",20
ladakh,"We reached the guest house just before dinner time. We were quickly shown to our rooms, thanks to our well-planned trip. For eight of us, we got four double rooms on the ground floor. The rooms were comfortable with a double bed, & with attached bathroom. The guest house was economical, more so because we stayed only one night. The rooms were clean but we had a little bit of struggle with hot water in the morning. A few of us ended up bathing with cold water. The dinner was a vegetarian buffet spread. It tasted like home food. The guest house is well-maintained with a beautiful garden. The flowers were in full bloom giving the impression it was spring in August. There were also trees of various fruits- apples, apricots, peaches & plums. In the morning, the breakfast was a simple",Let's Go Sightseeing,/Profile/LetsGoSightseeing,"Noida, India",40
ladakh,"We opted for the rooms in the older building as they were cheaper and we wanted to stay only for a night. The rooms are clean and there is a 24 supply of hot water which in itself is a bliss in Ladakh. The food was way too expensive and not worth the money paid. Charging 500 for 2 for dinner comprising dal, rice, roti and one sabzi felt exorbitant. The rotis were cold and when we asked for hot ones, they reheated the same ones making them dry and not eatable.  The property is well maintained. Has a beautiful garden and apple trees. When we were there, the apples were towards ripening. It was a sight to see those juicy apples, especially for people like us coming from cities where apples are super expensive and not fresh. We wanted to pluck one from the tree and try it. When we",meenakshi v,/Profile/meenakshiv2017,India,30
ladakh,"While our stay in Leh , we stayed for a night in Snow Leopard Guest house. Though we could not get a room in the new building , we got a good deal for the guest house rooms. The rooms were basic and enough for a night stay. But the garden view and feel of being around the mountains was amazing. The pictures will say for itself.  Though the geyser was not working for our room initially but then the manager got the wiring changed and it worked. All in all the stay was comfortable.  I think one thing which we found for most of our Leh trip was food , the food was average and variety was basic for the buffet. But as we were so mesmerized with the place around that we could manage with the food.  The hotel is really near to the sand dunes which makes it an option  to stay.

ladakh,"We stayed here on 12th Aug'13. The rooms were spacious, clean and comfy. The same goes for the attached bathrooms. The surrounding is serene owing to its location. Plus you can find so many different types of fruits like apples,apricots etc. But, what was not at all up to the mark was its food. It was just tasteless. One suggestion is do not expect non veg food here. For eggs also, you will have to tell the Hotel staff beforehand. Overall, a nice place to stay.",SAM_CS,/Profile/SAM_CS,"Bangalore District, India",40
ladakh,"Hunder itself being located at one of the extremes of Nubra Valley, the location of the guest house is mesmerizing. Nature is at her abundance around the building. The rooms are fantastic and the service is warming. The garden is a nice place for a stroll early in the morning. The food might be a concern out there owing to its lack of taste, but that's manageable. The interesting part is the food prepared is grown by the owner himself.",Bunku,/Profile/Bunku,"Kolkata, India",40

ladakh,We were on a roadtrip and without any bookings we landed up at Hunder. there are lots...and lots of guesthouses in Hunder. we checked out a few guesthouses when we reached Hunder and mostly they were clean and run by families. the reason we liked Snow Leopard was ...the bedding looked very clean and the garden was so beautiful with wonderful sit outs. the place is family run and they have such cute kids....my daughter was so happy playing with their child and both of them ran around the garden in joy. i requested them to make fresh Ladakhi bread for breakfast and they very happily served it for breakfast. we enjoyed chatting and interacting with one of their family members..Motup. food is simple and homey. this is a family run place and has a warmth in the service. they are,sailor04,/Profile/sailor04,india,50

They have three buildings one where the family stays, the old part has less number of rooms and the new building that is almost ready has the new rooms which are very good.

However some of the rooms have blankets and curtains which are very bright in color to the extent that they hurt your eyes! Also, there is construction going on so some parts of the hotel become very dusty. everything else is good. There is 24 hour running hot water and television in the rooms.

ladakh,"When you have an overnight stay in Nubra valley, you would first have to make the choice between Diskit and Hunder (the top two options). I'd vote for Hunder if you want to have a quiet, peaceful time.  In Hunder, would happily recommend Snow Leopard Guest House. The setting is really amazing. Lovely mountain views, a charming garden et al.  The owner, Mr. Dawa Norbu, is very friendly, polite, and hospitable. Other reviewers have put down the contact numbers, rates, and type of rooms. I'd like to add that I stayed in the old block, and those rooms are clean as well (well maintained too).  I'd read some negative reviews about food, and not just on Tripadvisor. However, my wife and I loved the food there. The veggies are plucked straight from their garden. We loved all the dishes,",Vivek R,/Profile/VivekR386,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"On my visit to Hunder, we chose to stay at the Snow Leapord home stay.  Run by a ladakhi family, they have two options on old block and new block. The rooms are smaller in old blocks but cheaper, new block rooms are equipped with television and other luxuries. The rooms are clean with hot water throughout. They have a beautiful garden with a view over the valley. The rooms are priced between Rs. 600 and 1000 depending on the block and facilities. They charged Rs. 200 for dinner and Rs. 100 for breakfast both vegetarian. The food preparation needs improvement, but was clean and fresh. It is a good experience to walk in the early hours at Hunder village, one can see the slow village life.
