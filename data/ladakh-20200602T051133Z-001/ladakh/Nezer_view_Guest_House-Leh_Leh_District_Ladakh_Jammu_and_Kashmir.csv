Some of the hotels I had browsed through at the airport didn't match up to the expectations.    I walked in to Nezer Holiday Inn, not sure of what to expect. I was warmly greeted by the owner on my arrival, and shown the room. The room was on the third floor with a delightful little balcony .The room along with the bathroom was quiet spacious and clean, The staff was very helpful, climbing up and down promptly at every call.

ladakh,"The reason to write this review is to share so-called ‘Wonderful and Memorable Experience’. I have had a chance to stay at Nezer View Guest House during my recent trip to Leh for the famous winter Chadar Trek on 1st week of February. During winters, most of (~95%) the hotels at Leh doesn’t work due to extreme cold climate -15 to -25⁰C temperature and scarcity of necessary items like water, vegetables, electricity etc. However, Nezer was like a paradise for us on the bone-chilling land of Leh.   Our room had wooden interior and fitted with a radiator heating system which made it cozy. Hotel is situated adjacent to the main market of Leh ~100m distance which makes it comfortable for quick shopping and open-up a lot of options of enjoying food at various nearby restaurants.

ladakh,It is located at 5 -7 minute walk to main market. The rooms are cozy and well lit. There is 24 hour running hot water as well as central heating. These two factors are crucial in making your stay comfortable specially in the months of november and december. Breakfast is provided on pay. There were limited items. Also there should have been some provision for dinner as well. Because market closes pretty early in leh in winters. So it becomes difficult to find any option outside for dinner. The staff is cooperative and attentive. They provide hot drinking water whenever asked. The owner also arranges taxi for local sightseeing as well as nubra and pangong tours. I would definitely recommend this hotel. ,Tanvi G,/Profile/310tanvig,,40
