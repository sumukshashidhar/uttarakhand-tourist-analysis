ladakh,"We've got reference of this hotel from a guy named Tenzing that 've met us over Jaspa. The hotel gives you value of money , really spacious room and most important comes really cost effective. They've charged us 5k for 3 big size rooms ( we were 10 guys ).Just for the comparison, others were charging 12-15k ( tourist season). STRONGLY RECOMMENDED...",Raghuwan,/Profile/Raghuwan23007,,50

ladakh,"Good rooms, you get wifi at reception, location is also good nxt to market, best thing here is tyson( labrador) very cute. Breakfast is also good here. They have their separate garage if you have your own bike you can park it.",Abhishek-Pawaskar,/Profile/Abhishek-Pawaskar,"Mangalore, India",40
ladakh,"The rooms are good to the price but the reason why you should pick this hotel over so many others is the location and the staff. The receptionist, Prakash, made the experience really special for us and we promised ourselves that when we came home we would write him a good review (and he didn't even ask us to, which many people in the tourist industry do). He is so friendly and helpful and will help you with everything you could possibly need. The second reason is the location; if you don't feel that you are part of the ""authentic"" backpacker segment in India (with loose pants, dradlocks and aum symbols all over) you really want to stay out of the Changspa area in Leh! This hotel has the same prices with good rooms but is in another area closer to the center of Leh which is more",Christine P,/Profile/christinep558,"Frederiksberg, Denmark",50
ladakh,"The hotel is in a very good location, rooms are spacious, ""good-ok"" view from the room. Hotel staffs are nice and helpful. No internet/wifi connection what-so-ever, but I guess this is a problem for the whole connection in Leh. Love the roses in front of the Hotel...We would love to stay in this hotel if we visit Leh again!!",sukrita_kaimook,/Profile/sukrita_kaimook,"Bangkok, Thailand",40
ladakh,"Rooms and bathrooms were quite big, clean and bright especially the ones in the second floor. View around was okay, not that great. Hot water was by and large available 24 hours and the LCD TV showed most channels   Bed linen, towels were clean and blankets provided were adequate for the nights. Breakfast and dinner were included in our package and consisted of  limited items but served hot and  quite tasty. The hotel is just a few minutes walk from the main market and taxi stand  and several good restaurants like Lamayaru, Gesmo  etc are nearby. The manager, Mr Prakash is quite helpful and can arrange tours to Nubra, Pangong etc if required.  WiFi is available but only in the ground floor and reception area. Overall it's a decent budget hotel in Leh which can be made a base ",D S,/Profile/DS944,"Kolkata, India",40
ladakh,+The Dog: Tyson!! + The rooms were big enough + Hot water bags are provided upon request (for cold nights) + The manager is always around near the reception + Rooftop view - WIFI signal was weak - Location was rather far from the restaurants/convenient stores and too far from main bazaar - price: let's just say I've found cheaper and better place to stay in,Kaneth25341,/Profile/Kaneth25341,"Bangkok, Thailand",30
ladakh,"Very clean hotel. Rooms are spacious and regular cleaning done. The staffs are friendly. Great sunny and clear view. Also having a good restaurant. Very peaceful, although just 5 minutes' walking distance away from the bustling market area. And very very pocket-friendly",Doc_Subhajit17,/Profile/Doc_Subhajit17,"Kolkata, India",40
