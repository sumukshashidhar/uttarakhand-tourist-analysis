ladakh,"I stayed at Karma Guest House with the family of Mr. Nawang and Mrs. Phunchok Dolma.  They were an extremely warm and happy Ladakhi family who treated me like family during my stay.  I loved the food they served, and they helped warm me up using their electric heater because I felt extremely cold during my stay.  The rooms and bathrooms were also clean! Highly recommended! :)",Christine Asuncion,,"Singapore, Singapore",50
ladakh,"Karma Guest house is truly a home away from home. Run by warm and very hospitable hosts, it is located in the walking distance from the city, Shanti Stupa,Namgay Tsemo and Leh Palace.  You have company of the lovely children while their mom and grandma prepares you organic food from their own kitchen garden.  They also organize adventure tours and homestay in rural Ladakh, apart from arranging transportation.  The family tie and respect they share, along with the optimum utilization of every resource/energy is very inspirational.  I brought back a lot of lovely memories, I can say I found a family there, not a hotel.",Tsering,,"Thimphu, Bhutan",50
ladakh,"I had not planned/ booked to stay here but they all good things are discovered. I will always cherish the happy memories of this place during my ladakh trip. And of course Jigmet, their 2 year old cute daughter.   It is set up in a beautiful idyllic location bit away from hustle bustle of the city but still close proximity to the city. The family running this is absolutely gem of person. In short for me it was like a homestay. They have earmarked few rooms for guests.  The place is very close to the Stupa and few rooms have excellent views.  I landed at this place with a couple and a friend who I was travelling places in Ladakh. I booked a single room which not only costed nominal compared to hotels but was also spacious, clean and well maintained.  They have a reasonably big",TarunandRajul,,"Bengaluru, India",50
