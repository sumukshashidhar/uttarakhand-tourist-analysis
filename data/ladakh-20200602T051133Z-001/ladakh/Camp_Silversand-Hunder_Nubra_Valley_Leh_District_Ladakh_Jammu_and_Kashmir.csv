ladakh,The property actually is very nice but the maintenance is very poor with wild growths around. The free area could easily be converted in to a lawn/flower garden etc.with good taste. The service is not very good either. The reception cum restaurant cum office is a good one but the food is prepared with little care. Not the best option in Hunder.,Anand G,/Profile/50anandg,"Kochi (Cochin), India",30
ladakh,We had stayed in Camp Silver Sand for 1 night during our trip to Nubra Valley as part of our Ladakh vacation. The hospitality provided by the staff here was home like. This place has 15 odd tents in the lap of nature - lots of trees and a mountain stream flowing through. The tent had comfortable bed and attached bathroom with all modern amenities. We enjoyed peaceful sleep at night and food was home like both for dinner & breakfast.,Kaushik G,/Profile/340kaushikg,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"Beautiful place and a very comfortable camp site with all facilities. Classic Camping in a place like Hunder where a very less proportion of Tourists visit compared to Leh. Service is great at this place, camps are very much comfortable, food is also delicious. Best part of this campsite is the views from this place and the Garden view at this place.",SahilChrungu,/Profile/SahilChrungu,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"Beautiful place and a very comfortable camp site with all facilities. The kitchen garden has fresh veggies that they serve you for meals. Very co operative staff and hot water in a camp! What else can you ask for. The placing is also such that its mountains all over with small streams flowing through the camp-site, the subtle noise of running streams is the perfect set up for a relaxing night at nubra. Apricots trees and a lovely camp! I highly recommend itüëçüèºüëçüèº",Rivoli Sinha,/Profile/rivolis,"Mumbai, India",50
