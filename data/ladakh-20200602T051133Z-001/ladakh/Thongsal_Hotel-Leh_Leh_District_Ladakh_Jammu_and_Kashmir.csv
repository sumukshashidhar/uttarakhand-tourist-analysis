ladakh,"We used this hotel as our base in Leh while travelling in the Ladakh region for 9 days. The staff in this hotel is extremely helpful and pleasant. They welcomed us with complimentary Kawah, very yum. My grandma was travelling with me, and the guys at the reception were so kind when she needed anything. Rooms and bathrooms are comfortable and clean. They have really common nice seating areas on the ground and first floor, and these are lovely sun traps to sit in on cold days. The breakfast and dinner are good. Wifi is iffy - excellent connectivity on some days and none on other days - but that is the situation all over Ladakh. Take your books with you, or just sit and stare about - the common area offers views of Shanti Stupa and Leh Palace!",SupriyaM110,/Profile/SupriyaM110,"Mumbai, India",40

ladakh,Thongsal is located very close to the Shanti Stupa making it a very peaceful abode during one's stay in Leh. Being away from the market ensures you aren't bothered by the noise and vehicular traffic.  The amenities are basic but provided with much care.

Thats the reason I selected this hotel the service provided was great and prompt. Amenities were all there. Food was yummy and all sorts of cuisines present. I could have so much fun and enjoy all this only because of great management of the Road Less Travelled team who had planned my trip.

However the food was worst than in any roadside dhaba. The Chef is fit to be a barber cause he makes omlettes with haldi. The daily breakfast and dinner were the worst food I have had ever in any hotel of some repute.I seriously feel that if you dont want to spoil your visit to this wonderful place dont make the mistake of staying in Thongsal cause you will detest the food. Added problem is that its 5 kms away from main market and hence one cant even go out to eat. The rooms and other facilities are so so. There is hardly any reception area.

No reception to help with luggage when arriving late at night, tired and in the dark. It took 30 minutes plus for a drink to arrive and I had to pressure the various staff members to deliver it! Tapped hot water was not available during times stated, a bucket was however delivered to the room.  Food at buffet was average, the only common area bathroom was a disgrace with no running water and no soap, and this just off the dining area.

Unbearably cold, snowing in the mountains, roads in the process of getting cleared up, 80% of the markets still closed & coupled up with the micro climatic changes & altitude, its not a very friendly time for tourism. But the most amazing thing about visiting in this season is the snow & the challenging climatic conditions which makes the destination a heaven.",monica j,/Profile/realmonu,mumbai,40
ladakh,I lives here on 12th April 2013 only single day and-after a day I changed the hotel because their staff is not giving attention on mature persons.They wants only drinker customer.When I demand menu or their tariff they refused.And on intercom services they replied when people come from Jammu than it will start.WI FY services was not available after force from my self I checked own bank on their lap top.No doubt location is very good break fast is also good but their behavior was very bad.The manager I don't know where he was.,yash545,/Profile/yash545,"New Delhi, India",20
ladakh,"I stayed in Thongsal multiple times. One thing that truly makes it different from any other hotel in Leh is location. It got most amazing location with breath taking view, also  its away from city crowd but still close to everything. On one side you can see ""Shanti Stupa"" while other side you can see Himalayan peaks. Perfect for vacation when all you want is quite and tranquil environment. Leh city market and all restaurant is in 5-10 minutes (either drive or walk).  Rooms are clean and bed is very comfortable , you surely need it after good day of sight seeing and trekking. Staff is very helpful and all needs were catered with great satisfaction. Restaurant has quite good option and off the menu items were also served when asked.   Hotel reception could arrange very good tours",abhijs,/Profile/abhijs,"Limassol City, Cyprus",50
ladakh,"Low season in Leh, a few guests -and a few staff, reasonable rate. We used the hotel as a base for our daily journeys in Ladakh, so, we did not use at all the hotel facilities. The hotel is located on the hills north of Leh, not that close to the city, but this makes it very quite. In the night you can enjoy a starring sky from the garden. The room was confortable and warm. The staff is very kind and helpful. Breakfast on average. The management should find a way to provide the rooms with hot water without waiting too long while running freezing cold water: it's a waste of a precious resource.",lungoilcammino,/Profile/lungoilcammino,"Brescia, Italy",30
ladakh,"I have visited Ladakh on numerous occassions and stayed in many hotels. Last year, a friend of mine told me about a new hotel called Thongsal. At first, I was a bit apprehensive as it was a new property and had no reviews available anywhere on the net. But based on my friends reccommendation I decided to stay at Thongsal.  As I entered the hotel area, I was pleasantly surprised firstly by the location. it is a stones throw away from Shanti Stupa, one of the most popular spots in Leh. A small river gently flows behind the hotel and you can hear the sound of the water while sipping a drink in the back garden.   The rooms are very nicely done up with wooden frames to give a 'Ladakhi' feel and I found that very welcoming because it makes u feel that you're in Ladakh which a regular",reply2tushar,/Profile/reply2tushar,London,50

ladakh,"If you are visiting Leh I would definitely recommend Thongsal for your stay. After a week of riding from Delhi to Leh we needed a good stay with all facilities and also be affordable. Thongsal managed to take care of all of it. This place is not far away from the main market but is peaceful from the maddening & chaotic traffic and crowd. The staff and room service is commendable, they were available 24/7 and ensured all our needs were taken care. The rooms were clean and very well maintained. The resort also offers some traditional programs as entertainment during the evenings. This place is also Biker friendly with good parking space. We enjoyed our stay here and would definitely recommend this to bikers or any others visiting Leh.",Arun A,/Profile/ArunA60,"Bengaluru, India",50

The rooms are very well furnished with LED TV, neat and clean bed sheets, hygienic toilet and 24hrs hot water. The staff is very prompt and courteous.  Their restaurant has a good variety of food on their menu both for vegetarians and non vegetarians. Also it has a very well stocked out door bar.. The tariff is quite reasonable for the kind of services being offered.  The location of the hotel is apt as it is just a few minutes away from the main market. We can go to the local market for shopping after sight seeing in the evening . The view of Shanti Stoopa from the hotel is very picturesque.

ladakh,"We chose the hotel after reading the reviews here. We loved the property, with its lovely views and spacious rooms. But that's where the honeymoon pretty much ended. The staff is courteous but super inefficient. Their wi-fi never works (they keep blaming the great flood of two years back for everything that does not function). Hot water is a big problem. On our last day we had to wait for more than an hour before one of the taps started functioning. One night our TV conked off and they could not fix it for the next few days. We stayed here in two spells. First time our room was next to the generator. Thanks to Leh's power situation, it pretty much ruined our sleep. Second spell we were promised upgrades - a room (no 107) with a better view, massive creaking bed, sliding bathroom",mindwithoutfear,/Profile/mindwithoutfear,"Mumbai, India",20
ladakh,"Ladakh! Its truly the most mesmerizing land in India and Thongsal is definitely the best resort in Ladakh. We stayed here for 4 nights and were thrilled to be here from the word GO... Thongsal offer truly exceptional levels of service, excellent & well appointed rooms. The bathrooms are very good and the mattress is the room is superb. The eye for detail is simply amazing with aromatic candles and oil infusers creating a mesmerizing effect. All rooms had 32inch Sony LCD's with dish TV which really helps on the first day to acclimatize in Leh. Tea coffee makers added the comfort of brewing a nice cup every now and then, although the cappuccino in the O2 cafe was much better.

The best part of my stay was the enchanting view out of the window and the picturesque beauty. The warm ambience here made my stay a memorable one. The exotic cuisine that was a part of Thongsalâ€™s fabulous menu was amazing. The staff is friendly and adds to the festive mood here.
