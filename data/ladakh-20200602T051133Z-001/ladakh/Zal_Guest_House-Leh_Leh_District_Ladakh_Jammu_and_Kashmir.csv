ladakh,"I love the time I stayed there and still miss it. The place is clean with a beautiful garden. It is not at the main bazaar, but just 10 mins walk distance. I   felt like home everyday I was there. I stayed there in May, the owner'family statred plating vegetables in their garden. Those who visit this place in summer would love the nice view of the garden and enjoy dishes from their farm made. ðŸ˜Š",nawkonak r,/Profile/nawkonakr,,50
ladakh,"We fell in love with this place the moment we laid our eyes on it. They have a beautiful garden and house which looked very welcoming. We stayed here the longest through our entire course of the trip and we are so glad we did! The owners of this house are very warm and friendly. They made us feel one with their family. The food they cooked for us was very healthy and delicious at the same time. All of the vegetables we ate came from their very own kitchen garden and needless to say this added to the taste of the meals.  Never once did they say no to any of our requests during our stay. We were looked after by the owner lady like family where she would provide us with tea, warm drinking water after our return from sightseeing at any time of the day.   This place gives us a",pawan r,/Profile/pawanr213,,50
ladakh,"My wife and I spent several weeks at the lovely Zal Guest House at different times during a two month trip in Ladakh. The guest house is about a 10 minute walk from the Main Bazaar on the newly paved Upper Tukcha road. It is a verdant oasis of tranquility and friendly hospitality where you can leave behind the noise and squalor of the market. It has a large, abundant and well-tended garden including all manner of flowers and vegetables (from which the meals are prepared) and has a nice little patch of lawn replete with picnic tables and even a hammock (that proved ideal for recovering from jet lag) set amidst fruit trees and towering poplars. It has several rooms with large windows looking out on the trees and garden. There is a large, clean shared bathroom on the upper floor",David H,/Profile/T1527YUdavidh,,50
ladakh,"Thanks to the Tripadvisor reviews, we insisted for Zal Guest house over Hotel Lumbini (Rated at the bottom 10 of 75 hotels in Leh) with Amish Shah. Later found out this one man show company from Pune, Footloose Gypsy is all for money and conveniently forgets most of the  promises made at the time of booking so that he can make money in the process, be it asking you to compromise on quality of hotel accommodation or safe transportation or providing a tour guide.  Me and my wife from Bangalore visited Leh-Hunder-Turtuk-Nubra valley-Langdong lake in July-2017. Initially we had to negotiate hard for Zal Guest house as Amish was very keen to put us in Hotel Lumbini (Shady place and cheap). Zal is run by a nice Ladakhi family, smiling and pleasing, They grow their own vegetables in",Suraj_D_K,/Profile/Suraj_D_K,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,"stayed there for 8 days in our long Ley trip.  Amazing people.  Personal touch.  Super breakfast and dinner.  Homely food.  value for money.   will go there again and again.

ladakh,The guest house is beautiful with clean rooms and attached washroom. It is at a 10 mins walking distance to Leh main market. The surroundings of the guest house are very peaceful.  The family which runs the guest house are very helpful and cooks delicious food. Great value for money!  One drawback: Wi-Fi doesn't work most of the time and connection is dead slow!,Nakul Kedia,/Profile/NakulK91,,40
ladakh,"Me and my husband stayed at the zal guest house during our 9 day trip to leh ladakh. Our stay during this time was really comfortable and the family which runs this business were really great at hospitality. The rooms were well maintained and had basic amenities like cot. Attached bathroom with 24/7 hot water supply. In a place like ladakh where we spend most of time traveling or outside the guest house, spending money lavishly on five star resorts is a waste. Zal guest house provided all the basic amenities like comfortable bed, great food and a peaceful ambience that any traveler would ask for. People there took our preference into consideration for cooking breakfast lunch and dinner. They made us some great ladakhi dishes as well. When one of us feel ill, they took great care",NRP12,/Profile/NRP12,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,"We found  Zal Guest House through recommendations. We called to reserve rooms and they were immediately helpful. We reach the homestay in the evening and they welcomed us with a hot tea, with herbs freshly prepared, and dinner coked with the vegetables from the garden. Delicious food! The breakfast in the morning is very rich and traditional: bread is amazing! The house is very nice and very well maintained. The garden full of colorful flowers is a treat to the eye! They are very very gentle, sweet and available. They helped us to arrange our trip to Pangong Lake and anything we need.  Good service/price proportion! Definitely recommended for an authentic experience in  a Ladakhi family! You will surely feel at home!",Elisa D,/Profile/elisad131,"Monopoli, Italy",50
ladakh,"* House is located very close to the Leh Market and 15 mins drive from Airport. * Rooms are very clean, spacious and comfortable.  * Hospitality and service is very good. * You get food if pre-ordered  * Good view of Shanthi Stupa through the windows. * Wonderful family(host) to spend time with. We still miss them a lot!  * You get free apples from their own Garden during early morning talks/discussions :) * Highly recommend this place instead of staying at some hotels, as you get to know    how good and kind are people in Leh.",Gowtham_Kamaraj,/Profile/Gowtham_Kamaraj,"Chennai, India",50
ladakh,Zal Guest House located at Upper Tukcha Road is one of the best Guest houses in Leh. The host Mr. Hishey along with his wife & 2 daughters Angmo & Nilza ensure best service to the guest at all times. Their garden has some of the best flowers one can see in Leh. One can even have typical Ladakhi breakfast comprising of Khambeer (Ladakhi bread) with apricot Jam with the chirping of Magpies in the neighborhood.   Also the proximity of the guest to the Main Market is just 10 minutes by foot. This makes it an ideal place to stay in Leh.,Amish S,/Profile/AmishS,"Pune, Maharashtra, India",50

ladakh,"We stayed here for a week during September 2014. This guest house is awesome. Nice built house with beautiful garden.   The hall and rooms are very clean, spacious with a fantastic balcony. This comes at a budget price as well. The place is close to Leh center market place and Leh airport as well.   The family who runs has mother, father and daughter. All of them were of immense help to us. They took care of us very much with food, references for bike rentals, car rentals and everything possible.   Overall, this place made us feel so much home during our Leh trip. I absolutely recommend this for both Indians/Foreigners.",Adithyan_TR,/Profile/Adithyan_TR,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",50
ladakh,"I visited Leh ladakh in August with my husband and friends and stayed at Zal for 5 days. The owners are absolutely hospitable and very warm. Rooms were decent & neat and tidy. What i loved the most was the conversation we used to have with him over dinner / breakfast. He is truly humorous and helpful. Food is too amazing to miss. it was like ""maa ke hath ka khana"". The place is just 10 mins away from the main market. All in all an ideal place to stay. i look forward to staying with them whenever i go there again :)",Rashmi S,/Profile/191rashmis,,50

The food is assume with both local LEH food and traditional Indian and continental food   They have a very good connective system with wi fi system   Siting in the balcony enjoying the white caped Himalayan ranges and the shanti stupa just seen from the guest house and the lovely gardening by the owner inspiring all of us   Miss the place   Regards  Vinodmoorthy  Pune  ",vinod,/Profile/vinodmoorthy,"Pune, India",50
ladakh,"We used the Zal Guesthouse as our base as we explored Nubra valley, Pangong and Leh.  We checked in and out several times during our tour.  The rooms are modern clean with a great outlook over the mountains and Chanthi Stupa.  The family who run it were very helpful, made us feel at home and made really great Ladakhi meals (make sure you eat at Zal at least once. The morning after a long day of riding, they bought Chai to our room, perfect.   It is very close to Central Leh so a short walk if you want to eat out or shop.  We will absolutely stay at Zal again.",Alan J,/Profile/597alanj,"Melbourne, Australia",50
