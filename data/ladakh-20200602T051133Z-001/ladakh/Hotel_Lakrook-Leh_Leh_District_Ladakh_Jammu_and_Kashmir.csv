ladakh,"Owner welcomed us upon arrival.  Staff is exceptionally attentive.  Food was very good.  Location is within walking to shops and markets.  Very clean.  Bathrooms were recently re-modeled.  Price is very reasonable.  If you are in the area, this is a great option.    Wifi is spotty, but it is spotty everywhere in Leh.  Common areas have strongest wi-fi.  Third floor is warmest (no a/c) and wi-fi isn't strong.    There are stairs to the roof from the third floor to dry things and see the city, if wanted.",C L,/Profile/c0rbynl,"Temecula, California",40
