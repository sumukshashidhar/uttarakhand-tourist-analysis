ladakh,a quiet and peaceful place with a very personal touch. comfortable and clean rooms with running hot water in the mornings. the gazebo is a wonderful place to sit for either morning meditation daytime views and evening drink. tsewang the owner is a warm and cheerful person who is very hospitable.,Arun771512,/Profile/Arun771512,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"This was a stop over from Srinagar to Leh. We had to skip the stay and loose the nights accommodation as I was disappointed with the entire place. Right from the way guests are welcomed to the rooms, bathroom , dining room ,food and even the sulky manager/ owner who didn't care to greet or meet the guests. I'll never recommend this hotel to anyone ",Ashitha B,/Profile/Ashitha,"Durban, South Africa",10
ladakh,"The resort is no doubt beautiful but it is very poorly maintained and the staff is here is disgusting & ill-mannered. Very very pissed off & furious with the resort manager here who is from Ranchi. Neither they have any good food items nor they have hot water to provide. Whatever we asked for his reply was ""Nahi hoga"" (can't do). Will not recommend people to stay here at all. ",Pratiti,/Profile/pratiti,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",10
ladakh,"Very friendly staff, but be prepared for comfortable, but basic accommodations. I first had room 105, but the bathroom window would not close.  I moved to room 121. Both the front door and its lock  stick and it was very hard to open/close the front door.    I enjoyed the room for these reasons: there is good lighting - even for reading in bed The TATA cable service carried CNN  (channel 631) and BBC (channel 633) as well as other English language news it is one of the rooms closest to the lobby and restaurant  There is electricity and hot water only at certain times of the day. I was with a group and the guide arranged for extended hours for both.  Wi-fi is available in the lobby and the hotel restaurant.  It was stable.  The hotel is walking distance from temples at Alchi,",Esther P,/Profile/EstherP1882,"Chicago, Illinois",30
ladakh,"I've been travelling in the Indian Himalayas for more than 12 years, sleeping in tents, homestays, guesthouses, monasteries, and hotels. The Alchi Resort was the worst experience ever. Overpriced rooms, outdated facilities, lazy management, and aggressive owner.",Yannick L,/Profile/yannickl62,"Lausanne, Switzerland",10
ladakh,"So, we kept this as a stop-off option while travelling from Kargil to Leh and we regretted this decision. This one is a peaceful and very quiet resort and has a very classical setup. The rooms are big and clean. The staff is very helpful and attentive. If you are looking for a good stay with good food and happy memories, this is a wonderful place.   What we loved? - the feel - old fashioned and very peaceful. - the staff - very attentive - the rooms - they are big - the food - very good food  What could have been better? - network coverage is a big problem here - wifi could have been provided considering network issues - all rooms have twin beds, they should have some with king size bed  We loved our stay here and surely recommend the same to anyone who's planning to visit this",vishal_negandhi,/Profile/vishal_negandhi,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,We stayed here in May 2016. The food quality was good. The cook was prompt in taking care of small requests.The rooms are small but the greenery maintained by the resort is amazing. Overall a good stay.,KP2001,/Profile/KP2001,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,Alchi resort is good resort keeping in view the remoteness of the village.   We arrived in Alchi on 11th September 2015 from Kargil. The journey was comfortable with beautiful sceneries along the way with many apricot trees.   During season tourists can find women selling fresh & dry local apricots which are a treat. On the way we stopped for lunch in Khalsi village at the Sun & moon garden restaurant. The lunch & the restaurant garden are relaxing. The restaurant has a lot of variety in both veg & non veg.   Alchi resort is located just at the entrance of the village. The hotel is peaceful & quiet like the village. The resort has an impressive garden with colorful variety of flowers all over. The weather was sunny & relaxing. As soon as we arrived the owner Mrs. Dolma greeted,Kanupriya_1981,/Profile/Kanupriya_1981,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,Our Ladakh trip was great beyond expectations. After our Kargil stay we check in at Alchi Resort. Amazing place and hotel was the best choice. Which was booked by our Local Agent.  We were very impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. The hotel was clean. The owner Mr.Namgyal  were very accommodating to our requests and went out of their way to meet our needs.  We will surely visit again  in future.,lorin97,/Profile/lorin97,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"We we're booked here by our agents for an overnight stay at Alchi. Located very close to the famous Alchi monastery, the property at first sight seems picturesque with small cottages with cozy rooms surrounded by gardens. It is only when you wake up in the morning that you find that you've been bitten by the million bugs that are present on your beds. This is expected only of absolutely cheap non-maintained options. Dinner and breakfast options in the buffet are non-existent to say the least. Will not recommend staying here unless absolutely necessary.",Jatin A,/Profile/Jatin1410,Nagpur,20
ladakh,"A very good place , situated at Ulektopo , very good location , comfortable and cozy rooms , very helpful staff and some very delicious food . We were the only people occupying rooms for our specific dates in spite of that the chef made a lot of variety of food just for our group",Guruwinder R,/Profile/GuruwinderR,,50
ladakh,Location - Alchi is not a big place but the location of hotel was good with a small market just outside Room - Wonderfull! nice ambiance with table and proper bed. Surprisingly the TV also works in a place where we dont get any mobile network. Bathrooms had hot water supply but it was not 24hrs. You have to inform the staff and they arrange for water immediately Food - Nice tasty food with a good variety. They had free Wifi service in the reception area.,Swapnil J,/Profile/swapnilkjain,"Hyderabad, India",50
ladakh,We traveled in June of 2015 to this place and stayed to this hotel. It was very cozy atmosphere in this hotel. Hotel owner himself took care of us. Hotel staff is very helpful and food was delicious. I would rate this hotel 5 out of 5. Everyone should stay here.,Kaushik R,/Profile/260kaushikr,,50
ladakh,"When you enter the resort, it certainly looks nice. The garden is well kept with many flowers and the bungalow style rooms are situated in a pleasant setting. Once inside the oom is a different story. Very basic rooms, very hard beds (feels like sleeping on concrete). Half the lights were not working. We therefore got a different room. This time a third of the lights were not working. Staff was friendly, wifi was not working and the food was ok. On our departure the packed lunch had been forgotten, though.",Ruud51,/Profile/Ruud51,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",30
ladakh,"The Alchi Resort is conveniently located in the village within walking distance to the monastery. It has bungalow style rooms scattered around a lovely garden with beautiful flowers and vegetables. The room is clean with simple and rustic furnishing. The beds are firm and hard and could be quite uncomfortable to people who are used to soft mattresses. The bathroom is basic and reasonably clean. Hot water is limited and shower in poor condition. Staff service was non-existent at the reception- either no one was at the reception or all of them were busy watching TV. Restaurant serves buffet only Indian vegetable dishes. Wifi is available at the lobby, but was not working during our stay.

ladakh,"Spent the third night of our 13 night trip to ladakh.. after a tiring journey when we saw the entrance to the resort, we were disappointed.. but when we entered it we were pleasantly surprised.. it was beautiful and peaceful.. the staff was very helpful.. the rooms and bathrooms were simple and clean.. we spent a memorable night here under a sky full of stars with the sound of the Indus flowing nearby.. was an amazing experience...",labdhi3,/Profile/labdhi3,"Mumbai, India",40

The architecture and decor are traditional and excursions to other monasteries can be organised.",emanurag,/Profile/emanurag,"Bengaluru, India",30

ladakh,"I have stayed in many fancy, spa resorts with fabulous service but this place is something else. This place is plain, basic and almost minimal but the untouched beauty of the surrounding mountains, the beautiful plants, love little birds , fresh apples and the smell of the village lift your soul in a way no fancy place can. The owner of the place along with the staff make your stay so homely and comfortable, you may be saddened when you leave. The rooms are clean with a basic clean loo.   The resort is down a narrow path once you enter Alchi so dont get purtubed if you riding. Carry your own alcohol if you want to drink.   It can get chilly at night so be prepared. The place shut by Mid September so please plan accordingly. Dont miss the monastery in Alchi, it is a world",nanC29,/Profile/nanC29,"Bengaluru, India",50

Toilet didn't work, shower was useless, beds were like concrete, the food was shocking and gave my wive tummy poisoning - she was very sick for 2 days - I didn't eat the food - it just didn't look right, so I kept well. Breakfast was horrific. Location handy enough - in the village, nice flower gardens - but do not even think of staying here - be warned!",Bob M,/Profile/KIWIBOB,Wellington,10

ladakh,We stayed here for a night enroute Leh on the basis of a recommendation by somebody who should have known better. Reason for choosing this property was basically its proximity to the monastery unlike the Uley Resort which in retrospect seemed a much better option. The location is decent but they have not maintained the property and seem to be only interested in cutting costs as much as possible. Everything looks run-down and dusty; the room was not pleasant to be in; food was average; had to struggle to get them to operate the boiler for hot water. The lady in charge had a very brusque manner and at one point while discussing breakfast menu was horrified that somebody wanted to have a paratha as well as ladakhi bread. Would not stay here again.

ladakh,"We chose to stay at Alchi Resort for 1 night when driving between Kargil and Leh because it is very close to Alchi monastery. While the location of the hotel is good, the property is not very well maintained. The rooms  were poky and smelly. The common areas had not been cleaned in some days. Food was strictly average and the manager of the hotel seemed overly keen on cutting costs. TVs were installed in the rooms but the cable connection had been disconnected. The hotel also had to be begged to switch on their boilers for hot water - they didn't want to because of insufficient room occupancy. In retrospect, I would have either chosen to stay outside Alchi (eg at Uley Ethnic Resort which seems to have a lovely location at the river) or at another Alchi hotel (eg Zimskhang, which",Smallgoat,/Profile/Smallgoat,"New Delhi, India",20
ladakh,"I stayed there with my group. As an Hotelier myself I see things better than normal tourist. I was sharing a room with my foreigner friend so first thing I did was to check the bathroom. Loo was dirty, there were long black hairs on bathroom floor, number of Bindi's on mirror, used soap was left behind means before handing over us this room was never cleaned. TV didn't work. Food was simple. Electricity is a pain in whole of Ladakh region. Most of the places gets only 3-4 hours power in evening. It was same in Alchi. Best thing about this place was its Garden. Staff was not at all co-operative. I wont go there again but dont see any good alternate either. I will suggest a good survey on net and choose any other place for a night. Alchi doesn't offer much sightseeing.",Satyendra T,/Profile/Satyendratiwari,"Bandhavgarh National Park, India",20
ladakh,"On the basis of information available on the net and on the mistaken notion that its high tariff would translate to acceptable quality, we had opted to stay here based on its proximity to Alchi monastery to have an early start and avoid the rush of tourists from Leh later in the morning.   Electricity was available for only three hours in the evening. Because of ""very low occupancy"" the generator was not switched on. A solar lantern was provided which did not function. There was no running hot water. There was only Chinese dishes for dinner (again because of low occupancy). Our room had a non-functional TV which could not be rectified.. The staff were uncooperative and surly, and the manager kept making excuses for non-performance. .",raydebdutta,/Profile/raydebdutta,India,20
