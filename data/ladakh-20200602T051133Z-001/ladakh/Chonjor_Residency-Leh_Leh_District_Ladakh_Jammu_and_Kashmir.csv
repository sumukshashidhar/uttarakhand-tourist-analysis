ladakh,"This is a pretty average hotel, situated on a dusty old road. The only thing going for it is the proximity to the main market. The rooms are smallish, and even two persons will feel a little cramped. We were allocated three different rooms during our overall stay here. The room on the terrace floor has a little view of the hills when you step out to the faux lawn. How long this will last depends on the construction of the hotels coming up on the side and in front of this property.  The problem here was that given the hot weather in Leh when we visited, the room was unbearably uncomfortable even in the nights. On the next return stay, I asked for a room on the first floor - and that was a disaster. This room (209) overlooked the road, and we were kept awake all night with the",Sunder S,/Profile/SUNDER1508,"Secunderabad, India",30

Best thing about staying here is the amazing hospitality they provide, right from the entry to exit. They even provided us free pick and drop to airport. Rooms were very comfortable, with nice views. Roof top of the hotel is well maintained and provides amazing views. The tours and travel desk guy - Akbar is way too good. He just made our travel to Nubra and pangong so comfortable. Very courteous person. I would highly recommend. Food is mind blowing, buffet specially in the dinner is delicious with enough options for both Non-Vegetarians and Vegetarians.

We had a wonderful experience as this hotel is only 20 minutes away from the airport, 10 minute walk to the main leh market and is also located on the quiet old Leh road which is peaceful and less noisy compared to living in the main market area. So everything was very easily accessible. The staff was very courteous and the food was good. They had a good spread for breakfast and lunch/dinner and were also accommodating with customising food on special requests. We had indian, chinese and south indian and it all tasted very good. This hotel also has good speed Wifi which is a privilege to find in Leh. I would highly recommend this hotel as it's relatively new and hence very clean and well kept.",Sonika M,/Profile/sonikam700,"Mumbai, India",40
