ladakh,"We had a wonderful stay last month at the Radhu’s Boutique Inn.  The hotel was exemplary, from the excellent hospitality to the comfortable rooms. I have nothing but the highest praise for this hotel and its team. This was a very memorable trip, thanks to the gracious hospitality and outstanding service at the Radhu's Boutique Inn.  The location of this place is simply fantastic as the market is conveniently located nearby (approximately 10/15 minutes walk). When you’re hungry, you can also try their delicious food, especially the local cuisine! We thoroughly enjoyed interacting with the hotel staff, particularly the owner, Ajaz; they went out of their way to accommodate our tastes and needs. We will definitely return to the Radhu's boutique inn.",Laila N,/Profile/717lailan,,50

ladakh,"If you want to choose a stay without any bad surprise, here it is!  Ajaz and his staff are amazing person who will help you for any queries. The guesthouse is like 10-15min walking from the market (but souvenirs shops, restaurants and coffees start right outside the guesthouse and continue till the market center) which is very nice because it’s more quite and peaceful.  The house and rooms are very cute, super clean with all the facilities and you will be amazed by the view of the mountains and trees from the rooftop and the windows in the rooms.  The cooker makes very nice Indian food and will be more that happy to adapt the dishes if needed. The little garden is peaceful, with apricots trees - great place to read a book borrowed from the library upstairs. Wifi is available, it",Brunomumbai,/Profile/Brunomumbai,,50
