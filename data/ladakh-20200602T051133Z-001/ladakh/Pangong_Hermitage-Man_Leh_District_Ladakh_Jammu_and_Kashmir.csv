ladakh,"This place is bang on pangong lake, away from all the crowded places around Pangong. Stay here provides you your own piece of pangong quite literally. Absolutely serene Pangong lake is visible right from your bed and a beautiful snow capped mountain backdrop adorns on the other side. All rooms are heated including heated washrooms and electricity and heating is supplied all through the night. Pangong is obviously the biggest attraction of this place but one thing that equally stands out is the staff of this hotel - absolutely amazing guys who do all that is in their capacity and muchs more to make ur stay memorable. Special mention to the 5 star quality food served, which for this location is absolutely un-imaginable. Awesome, Fantastic, Fabulous, Serene, Heaven on Earth is the",Smita G,/Profile/SKAGARWAL22,,50
