ladakh,Best budgeted guest house if you are travelling to Leh. 10 mins travel from Leh Airport. Best thing about this place is freshly cooked food. Ask anything from Dal Rice to traditional Thupa. Wifi facility is also available. Rooms are very neat & clean.I really enjoyed my stay at Khangsar. My host Damdul was very cooperative.,Re.Shar,/Profile/VidhiRe,"New Delhi, India",50
