ladakh,"The worst hotel. Room services are poor. Telephone was not working. Basic amenities are not provided in the room. On complaint, manager answers rudely and threateningly. Totally uncomfortable and avoidable.",Sanjay B,/Profile/681sanjayb,"Jaipur, India",10
ladakh,"Right along side main market in Leh this hotel is a must option if you want to spend relax time after all those hilly travel all the day. Best food, amazing chicken preparations, fantastic staff and hospitality. Cosy rooms with all day hot water. Clean bathrooms and they provide additional linens in cupboards. Enough parking space with all dailyneed items shop just outside the hotel entrance makes it more comfortable for families travelling with kids. Over all a fivestar place.",Aakkash S,/Profile/AakkashS,"Pune, Maharashtra, India",50
ladakh,"Hotel is very close to Leh market and some of the best restaurants here in leh. Gesmo, Sumner Harvest and Tibetan Kitchen are merely two mins walk from here. Many good shops are also available around the hotel.  Rooms are good, staff and food is also good here.",Harshal A,/Profile/harshal88ajmera,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"The hotel is very near to main market. The hotel staff is very very cooperative. It has all the amenities you need. Their manager Deepak is very friendly and arranges anything you need. The staff provide breakfast even at 6 AM in morning which I have rarely seen.  The hotel decor, is good but its staff is excellent.  Most of the hotels don't have lift so you may prefer ground floor if you have problem climbing stairs. But if you have habit of getting up late, prefer ist or second floor as many people go for sightseeing in morning at 5 0r 6 and they will create noise",rajeshceeri,/Profile/rajeshceeri,"New Delhi, India",40

It is centrally located at the market on one side and the most beautiful mountains and valley on the other side.  While you are there, make sure you go up the terrace as you get the most amazing view. In the evening they even have a cultural dance in the hotel, which is fun to watch. The rooms are decent.

ladakh,Hotel is neat and clean and the location is good. Stok kangri range is particularly visible from the roof. Food is good. Hotel service is good too no complaints. Only food if you have to purchase is expensive. It is 300 per person. ,Uday S,/Profile/715udays,"Kolkata, India",40
ladakh,Stayed for 3 nights in the suite room. The rooms are spacious and clean with good views of the mountains. Staff are polite and manager was very helpful. We stayed for 2 nights initially and then moved onto Nubra valley and Pangong lake where we spent a night each. As we were on a long trip with lots of luggage we didn't want to tag it along everywhere. The manager was kind enough to let us leave part of our luggage in the hotel for 2 nights. On our return we spent another night here. The hotel offers a good package including breakfast and dinner which we opted for. The food was decent and had a good spread. The hotel exterior has typical Ladakhi architecture with nice wood carvings. The main shopping and eating areas are just round the corner so it's a nice place where,GallivantingSoul,/Profile/GallivantingSoul,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"Very close to Leh market, main bazaar and chankzpa bazaar. Managers are very cooperative and staff are friendly and helpful. It's decent hotel with all necessary equipment. Rooms are quite clean. Room service is also very good and apt.

ladakh,Pros: I got an awesome deal on a online with great discount.  I should say the value for money was great as compare to actual hotel rates.  Nice and clean room space  wi-fi connectivity but very low speed and most of the time its not available Average breakfast and dinner Near to main market so its good for the shopping,sushil j,/Profile/891sushilj,"New Delhi, India",30
ladakh,"We stayed here for 1 night only and it was a good experience.  Located about 10 minutes walking from the main market, the location of the hotel is central.  The staff service is good. The WiFi is slow and unreliable like in most places at Leh.  The rooms however were pretty large and spacious. There's no fans or heater in the room, but we were able to sleep comfortably. On the flipside, due to the open design of the hotel, noise on the ground floor can easily be heard on the higher floors. Hot water is available all day.  Overall, we had a pleasant experience staying here briefly for 1 night and would recommend this hotel for those seeking comfortable large rooms, near the market area.",Rahul Ajmera,/Profile/rahulajmera,"Pune, India",40

ladakh,"The location is excellent and the staff is quite nice. This is where it ends. The mattresses are very hard, and the location is noisy at night (rooms 306 and 307 especially). Every day there was an issue with the room set-up, as it seemed impossible for my friends and I to get consistent towels, toilet paper, soap and sheets. One morning, we asked for an early breakfast at 6:30 and were told that was fine. At 6:55, as we were leaving, the attendant said we could wait five more minutes, but our taxi was there, so we left without eating. On my last morning, I asked for a 6:00 am wake-up call and 6:15 am taxi. I got a pounding on the door at 5:50 am, with a man saying my taxi was there, so I hurried quickly, only to wait for 30 minutes in reception. My friends were told that 9:00",Elizabeth W,/Profile/909elizabethw,"Laguna Vista, Texas",20
ladakh,"We had a good experience staying at the Grand Willow. The rooms were clean, spacious and well ventilated. When one is in a new place it is important to have proper guidance and the staff was really helpful with the information.  Some points to keep a note of:  1) Food was good. We usually had breakfast and dinner. 2) Hot water supply through the day. 3) Room service was adequate. 4) Laundry Service available. 5) Lighting in the rooms was a little dim. 6) View from the terrace was also good.",Sumit S,/Profile/SumitS2147,,50
ladakh,"Cozy hotel at the heart of Leh market place. All amazing restaurants and just arround. The lawn is flooded with flowers. Big and clean  rooms and bathrooms. Food is good enough. Hotel looks preety good and you can see Stok kangri range right from the balconys. Go to the roof and Leh palace is visible. Stuffs are helpful, friendly and well behaved. Can't expect any better from the hotel.",neogidip,/Profile/neogidip,"Chennai, India",40
ladakh,"We traveled from Srinagar to Leh in last week of July. We'd booked the hotel in advance and the check in process was smooth. Staff was helpful and courteous.  Rooms were pretty basic but decent enough as most of the time was to be spent travelling in and around leh. Couple of things about the rooms though  1) Lighting was very dim 2) Bathrooms were not up to the mark (no Jets ;). Although hot water was present all the time.   Wifi is free but not very fast though it is more than adequate coz on a vacation you should not be needing it much. Food was OK. The breakfast buffet did not have much options and dinner buffet was adequate of both veg and non-veg varieties.  Though in the evenings, the options for snacking were limited. They only prepare veg sandwich and pakoda it seems in",priyeshk686,/Profile/priyeshk686,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
ladakh,"Me and two other friends were in a motorcycle trip and chose this place just while driving around. While we planned to stay only one night, we ended up staying 5 nights because we couldnt get out of Leh due to landslides or one reason or the other. Originally, the 'negotiated price' was Rs 3500 with an extra bed but later he agreed for Rs 3000.   The good -  1. Walkable distance to ATM, Restaurants and main Leh Market. 2. Nice little garden, where you can relax and have a beer when sun is out. 3. 24 hour hot water (hot means hot!) 4. Tea  The bad - 1. Restaurant is very average and bit pricey. 2. Laundry is quite expensive (Rs 700 for like 5 shirts,2  jeans and 2 pants). But then again, at least they provide the service!  The ugly - 1. Lazy housekeeping - The sheets in our room",PKukreti,/Profile/PKukreti,"Noida, India",40
ladakh,Well placed in the city. Rooms were good. Food quality was also good. Best part was the hospitality which was excellent. Each and every staff were eager to go one extra step to ensure that guests were happy. The youngest member of our group fell sick due to high altitude and hotel authority provided superb support in calling doctor and arranging for oxygen cylinder very late evening. We were touched.,Subhendu Sen Sarma,/Profile/681subhendus,,40
ladakh,"Stayed here in july 2015, this place is located near leh market and that's why we had selected this place but hotel staff is terrible with behaviour linked to tips. Food was terrible and rooms lacked basic amenities like water camper or thermos for storing water in night, smelly bed sheets and pillows and staff refused to change it also. .. refused to wash car etc etc",ashun r,/Profile/ashunr,,20
ladakh,"Cox & Kings tours arranged our accommodation here.  It was bit let down, since the place was average, rooms were very ordinary.  We stayed in new building, which is definitely better compared to nearby old building.  This hotel is nearer to market and general shops.  Hotel staff were very friendly, courteous and helpful; served us to best of their abilities with available resources.  This gesture made us to forget other shortcomings and enjoy the stay there.  Food was good; the kitchen staff use to come to us to check our preferences, before preparing the food.",Shankaraprasad,/Profile/Shankaraprasad,"Bengaluru, India",30
ladakh,"This Hotel is now looking a bit tired. The phone was dead, Electricity very iffy, Bathroom quite shoddy and room about ok. The shower literally had 3 small spouts coming from it and was cold. I ended up turning the tap on instead, which was warmer, but came out of the wall at about belly button height which made it awkward to wash. The report in my Lonely Planet book was ok for this Hotel, but that was in 2009!! The Hotel is in a very good position and the staff are friendly. As Indian Hotels go it's not too bad, the food was average, although I only had breakfasts.",jools011,/Profile/jools011,"Pulborough, United Kingdom",30
ladakh,Visited on August 2013. It is very near to the main market. Cosy ambience - helpful staffs. Management will also arrange your permits in advance with transport. This is a budget hotel with a small garden infront of the dining hall & reception on the ground floor.   A new block of Deluxe Rooms are still on process just beside. Most of the city hotels do not have landscape views but the hotel offers clean rooms with hot food. Nice behavior. You can try for it.,nilanjanbasu,/Profile/nilanjanbasu,"Kolkata, India",40
