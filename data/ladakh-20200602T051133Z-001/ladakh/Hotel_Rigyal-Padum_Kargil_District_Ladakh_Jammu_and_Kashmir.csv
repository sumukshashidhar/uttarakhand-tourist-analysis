ladakh,"This was amazing place as of the minute we entered - a young boy not properly speaking English showed us our room, very clean, bathroom smelling nicely, white tales still white that you are not afraid to step in barefoot...  Hotel restaurant is a perfect choice as they cook as spicy and hot as you wish and you get enough not to feel hungry...  Walk in price is 1000 INR per room which considering very small up charge vs Ibex (at different review) is worth the quality and hospitality of the crew. The meal is paid on top  of the room rate.  Perfect choice which I'd repeat when in Padum. ",Marek T,/Profile/779marekt,"Paris, France",50
