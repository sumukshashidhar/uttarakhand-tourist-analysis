There was a perfect view over kargil which means it is located above kargil in a peacefully environment, but still near to all important facilities like thr bus stand or even hospital. What made our stay so memorably was, that everything was working. We had a warm shower, fast wifi in our room, a working tv etc. and very friendly staff who was helping with every problem we had.

Hot water shower was wonderfully hot due to solar heating. Room and bathroom were clean and large. Dinner was GREAT. We do not eat meat and they accommodated our request for less salt, less oil, and less hot spice. Next morning we had to leave early. Our breakfast was fruit, yogurt, Potato Paratha, juice, and coffee. More importantly, it was ready at 5 AM!  Yes we will be back next year in this family owned and operated hotel.

Due to the high costs of a room here and some favorable reviews I had anticipated a place where I could chill out. I had been traveling 45 days and this hotel definitely was the worse of my trip. My past reviews will demonstrate that I usually give favorable evaluations at my lodging places. The only ammenities were 2 tiny bars of soap. There was no drinking water except an empty pitcher.

Caravanserai actually serves the purpose- at 2000 INR i thought the rooms was overpriced but it had hot water (a Deluxe room).   What i liked about the hotel is the setting- great view and a relaxing balcony/terrace to sit out.  During the day there is nobody there- staff and management are only there in the morning and later afternoon/evening as few guests spend a day here.   The staff is a bit unprofessional- they don't quite get that people come to a hotel and may actually want to sleep. Staff was shouting and yelling to each other at midnight as well as at 6 am.
