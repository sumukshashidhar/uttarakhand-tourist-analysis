ladakh,"Booked their for night for my family ,  situated in Spangmik Village it had by far one of the best if not best tents in the vicinity   1. Accommodation is provided in big tents , which had surprisingly amazing Very good Hygenie standards in such a remote area   2. Beds are comfortable and they provide enough Quilts and blankets to overcome chill of that attitude   3. Power is provided through backup for limited hours during night and they have limited duration for supply of hot water as well in that remoteness   4. Tents have inbuilt clean toilet and bathroom as well   5. They have centralised area for Food where they provide good buffet options for food  6. And last not least situated just 30 metres from pangong lake giving awesome views   All in all well equipped for a short",Nikhil,/Profile/Nik_Travel_007,"Ghaziabad, India",40
ladakh,What a place to stay - tent-age accommodation overlooking the Lake - one could easily walk to lake shore. Clear sky during the night. One could see milky way and all kinds of stars. Staff of the Resort was amazing and they made every effort to make our stay comfortable. We were given Hot water bags to warm our beds. Generators were kept on till late mid night and hot water was available in the morning. Food had limited choice but it was good.,Dalbir_S_Virdi,/Profile/Dalbir_S_Virdi,"Navi Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Highly recommended camp for its setting by the lake, its very comfortable tents, good food but most of all by its extremely friendly staff and owner Ghaphel, who I would like to thank once more for his generosity and friendliness. Thanks to him and his staff, the nightmare of the 9 hours bus ride and heavy shower became a beautiful human experience around the Pangong lake! Daphne",Daphne H,/Profile/daphneh,,50
ladakh,"two thumbs up. I got good quality bed, great view, clean toilet, yummy food and nice chit chat with the hotel manager. They also provided free oxygen for those who experienced AMS. Oh ya, there was a tea break too in the afternoon. ",citrasiagian,/Profile/citrasiagian,,50

ladakh,Very nice quiet tents by the lake side. Minutely thought of ideas and well organised tents with very superior wash rooms along with netted protection to the entry of tents with a nice sitting out area in front. Walk to lake is 100 Mtrs and early Morning view of lake is mercerising. Decent on pocket but may be a bit over priced. Food is decent and could be better but love football matches were fun to watch in evenings. All in all a good place to stay. ,Prem Singh,/Profile/840prems,"Chandigarh, India",40
ladakh,"Located only 150 metres or so from the edge of the lake. Probably the nearest one to the lake in Spangmik. Comfortable for one night stay. The staff are very helpful despite being overloaded with tourists. (Made us a simple breakfast in the dining area at 6 AM for our early morning departure). The only problem in Spangmik is you are incommunicado with the rest of the world, except for an STD booth run by an elderly lady.",drsdas2009,/Profile/drsdas2009,,50
ladakh,"a) Reachibility: Its a bit difficult to locate this hotel as there are more tents in this area and also we could not find any boards that could assist us in reaching this location. b) Service: Good service with nice food and hot water in the morning. c) Cleanliness: Tents are clean comfortable. d) Location: The hotel is located in midst of mountains with a good view of the famous Pangong lake.  As usual, Electricity available between 18-23 hrs IST.",Guruprasad K,/Profile/GuruprasadK,"Mumbai, India",40
