ladakh,"Mangyul Guest House had been our home for 5 nights during our stay at Leh last month. I have been to quite a few places, but this place was sheer poetry. Waking up to snow lines and lush green garden amid the arid desert was the incentive that we hadn't expected!  The staffs took extra care to prepare food for us which included fresh veggies from the garden in the hotel premise.  No, I'm not saying that you'll get 5-star amenities here, but the basics including running hot water and WiFi are live savers! More than all the warm smiles of the people in the guest house are the best gift that you could ask for!   Here's to Mangyul and here's to Leh ❤",Koyel R,/Profile/KoyelR7,,50
ladakh,"As part of Stok Kangri expedition, I stayed here for around 5 day and had nice experience. Owner of the place Tsewang Norbu stays in the same place helps arrange for anythings thats required during the stay. He even dropped me to airport when I left. Rooms are spacious and you can get multiple layers of quilt if required. For entertainment, u get a tv and tata sky, and bsnl wifi. I would recommend this place if you are looking for a decent accommodation.",Rajesh G,/Profile/RajeshG1198,,50

The staff and the owner of the place is very friendly and the rooms are clean and spacious. The market and the Leh palace are just a five minute walk from the guest house. I had great time here, spent nearly five days, very good and affordable place.",Ragav R,/Profile/278ragavr,,50
ladakh,"This is our second visit to Leh,and we had been on a trip for a fortnight.Leh,to put it aptly is a heaven.The moment you enter Leh you feel like you are in a military camp surrounded my cops and military ppl.Once you start exploring you find there is a lot of mesmerising things right from rivers,lakes ,hill view,road trips what not....To enjoy this you need to have a peaceful dwelling.One such place is MANGYUL GUEST HOUSE. Owned by a youngster Mr Norbu, this place is a home away from home. Fully covered by lush green fields this serene atmosphere is a bliss. Rooms are spacious, clean and well maintained. It’s very near to Leh market place. Norbu has made sure you get a glimpse of Leh from his place.

ladakh,"Mangyul Guest house is located in a nice location near to market, the room is new, spacious and clean, with a nice garden view.   We are malaysian travel in group of 3 on own leisure. On the first day we arrived, one of my travelling partner had mountain sickness and the owner Norbu help to send her to hospital, to get the oxygen, and he refuse to take any token of appreciation from us, he said is his responsibility to make sure all his guest is well.   Norbu is a very kind person. He show us around the place, help us to plan our itinerary in Ladakh, he also help us to get a very good driver for the few days visiting Ladakh. He invited us to his house. We then have opportunity to meet the local family and we were served ladakh tea and greet by his family.  We have a wonderful",Hansi L,/Profile/HansiL3,,50
