He also took really good care of our friend who got sick there. Hotel can arrange the trip with reasonable price.  Only minor thing was the restaurant service which was quite slow.,pt_us,/Profile/pt_us,"Bangkok, Thailand",40
ladakh,Loved this hotel from the moment we sat on the patio looking at a beautiful flower and vegetable garden after an extremely warm welcome from the hotel manager. We had lunch when we arrived and my positive view of the hotel was compounded by the wonderful food - the best vegetable biryani I‚Äôve ever had. The rooms were large and comfortable with great views of the mountains. The hotel is also well placed to walk into the centre of Leh for some shopping or to enjoy the local cafes (although the food at the hotel was so good we didn‚Äôt sample the local cafes and restaurants). There were a couple of negatives- service in the restaurant was very slow and we had to let the water run for an inordinate amount of time before it ran hot enough for a shower - but these were minor irritations,Lynne S,/Profile/LynneS71,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",40

We checked-in at 9PM in the night and we had to search for the Hotel for nearly 30 mins since there is no direct access to the hotel from the road. You have to walk for a minute from the road and there was construction going on and it was very difficult to find it. However hotel staff came to our rescue and guided us to the exact location.

ladakh,"In 2017 July, I was in Padma Guest House & Hotel again. This is my second time in there for I was once there in 2015. Different was that my first visit was on the beginning of spring and this time was in Summer. Leh is changing everywhere within 2 years, developed a lot, including the expanded airport. As it was a tourist season whole area of Leh is crowded, alive and dynamic!  My journey was actually incredible, all arranged by Padma travels, hotel and guest house. Within my limited days Padma proposed me a wonderful itinerary, beginning  from Leh and surrounding such as stiput monastery, hall of fame, peace (Shanti) stupa, Leh palace and castle. Then on next day all the important places, gompa and monastery to the east of Leh, including thiksay, shey palace, chemdrey, taktok,",kz20162016,/Profile/kz20162016,"Yangon (Rangoon), Myanmar",50

However, there was a serious problem in that all three of our group got sick (one very sick) after eating in the restaurant. This happened on two occasions. This was a great pity as the food was actually very tasty! I would have rated the hotel a 4 but for this aspect.  Minor negatives were also that we were on the ground floor and the windows opened onto a very dusty area with no privacy at night.   Further, we found that the WiFi here was much worse than the other hotel we stayed in in Leh.

Wifi is very hit and miss, but that's a problem in Leh itself, not down to the hotel. The only reason I cannot give this 5* is because of the ongoing building work, so the noise does continue throughout the day.

We are from Kerala, the southernmost state in India and were a little apprehensive on planing a trip to the farthest state up North and to such an altitude. Padma put all our apprehension to bed.   I chose Pdama after initially seeing a few pictures of the place on a youtube video and further reading a lot of positive reviews about the place.

The food is good and the staff are very welcoming. As they have dealt with western tourists for years, they have very good experience in choosing the menu and availability.I was picked up from the airport and was given a warm welcome with ladakhi chai.

Great Rooms. Extremely cozy. Bathrooms were clean with running hot water.   3. Super service. We reached Leh without any booking but had read about Padma on tripadvisor. For the first night we didnt get a room witha TV. As soon as an option was available, we were promptly moved.

Running hot water was not available due to the time of year but was delivered to my room in large buckets whenever I required it. Breakfast was included and eaten with the owners family in their kitchen. The service was excellent and I also utilised the in house travel agency to arrange day trips to the monasteries & Pangong Lake, an overnight stay in the Nubra Valley & a four night/three day trek staying with local families.

Breakfast was included in our rate and the rooftop restaurant was a very peaceful and scenic place to chill, producing decent food (aside from breaky - we tended to eat in town).  But where this place excells is in their care/service. From email bookings through to last mintue itinerary changes, the manager/owner was allways available and ready to assist.

We also organised several trips around Ladakh through the guest house and every one was very well organised, with great and friendly local guides to show us around, and well and reasonably priced.

The owner has solar power supply, so he does not depend on frequent power cuts in Leh. They can provide gas heaters too, but I recommend hot water bottles instead.

Staff are very friendly and helpful and can help organise treks and tours of the region.

Last year I stayed at Lharimo, just across the lane from Padma. This year i stayed two nights in Padma, and two in Omasila. While last year's stay in Lharimo was decent enough, the Omasila this year was a great disappointment. The cleanliness was awful.
