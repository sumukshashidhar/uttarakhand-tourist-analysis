From the general workers to the friendly dog that comes in to sit in the garden every day from 7pm to 7am nothing can b complained about. The kitchen helps were every ready to cook up anything for a meal. Rooms very clean n spacious. Do opt for room 205,beautiful view of apple trees from window. Manager Mr.Rajan was extremely helpful from providing  oxygen tank to porridge,most of all he had a big smile every time you walked into the hotel . Thank you Rajan Ji for making our stay beautiful.",Ravinder R,/Profile/447ravinderr,,50
ladakh,"The location of the hotel is superb, right where the main market starts. The rooms are big and quite well maintained. There is frequent electricity cut and wifi hardly works, but the hotel can't be blamed for that as it is the problem everywhere. The food has variety and taste both. Full marks to the staff which was very helpful! The garden is just amazing.",Pranay,/Profile/842pranayp,"Pune, India",40
ladakh,"The hotel is located on Fort road, one of the busiest marketplace of Leh. In spite of that, the hotel has a big garden and huge rooms, huge lobby space. The room is equipped with TV, water heater(for tea), tea kit, cupboard, wall fan etc. The bathroom is big and clean. 24 hours hot water facility and room service is also available. The buffet dinner is expensive, but quite yummy. Overall a nice hotel.",Amaresh M,/Profile/amareshm2013,Jabalpur,50
ladakh,"Located in just 5 minutes walk from the main market of leh.  Hotel is really beautiful and gives perfect idea of luxury holidays. Got really beautiful garden as soon as you enter inside the gate. Lobby is decent enough. Rooms are really nice and spacious. Gives fresh feel as soon as you enter. Few of the rooms has balcony, luckily our room had. Restaurant is just next to lobby, serving Indian and Tibetan food. Hotel staff is always smiling and welcoming.

ladakh,"The staff here were very good.  More than happy to help you anyway they could.  Ranjit the Manger was such a nice man.  He would give you Chi at any time of the day or night - nothing was too much trouble.  The kitchen staff were very happy to cook our eggs how ever we liked them.  The rooms were spacious and clean and tidy, they were serviced everyday with fresh towels etc.  This is a great place to get washing done it comes back beautiful and clean and all nicely folded.  Its within easy walking distance of the main town.  I would stay here again.",RATZnz,/Profile/RATZnz,"Ashburton, New Zealand",40
ladakh,"We stayed for 4 days in the hotel. The rooms are clean. The location is best very close rather in the market. Hot cold water is available, the room service is excellent and quick. The food is not very great but comfortable. The closeness to the market also has a little noise problem but it does not bother.",Tejinder J,/Profile/TejinderJ,Chandigarh,40
ladakh,"I had a wonderful opportunity to do a Manali Ladakh bike trip last month. We didn't get to pick the hotels as it was a tour package, but I was quite pleased with the hotel.very close to the town. And loved the service- spacious room as well as toilet,with provision of hot water through out the day.... The only problem we faced was lack of wi-fi as there was power shortage , not sure if it was just a one time thing. Good food, friendly staff altogether had a pleasant experience",Liz Andrews,/Profile/lizandrews2015,,40
ladakh,"Stayed here for 3 nights. Rooms were large, clean and airy. It is located close to the market. There was always sufficient hot water. But the best part was the staff Rajan, Babloo and Pashang who attended to us tirelessly whether it was tea at 5 am in the morning or hot drinking water late at night. ",uttaraja,/Profile/uttaraja,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,We stayed here for 2 days. Nice and warm hotel with 24 hours hot running water. Quick room service with decent food and wifi.

ladakh,"Stayed here as part of Cox & Kings Ladakh delight package. Spent 5 nights and stay was very good. Staff is THE attraction as they are very polite and happy to serve always.

They have a nice lawn outdoors where one can sit and order food. Its not crowded and has sufficient space for parking",princeanil,/Profile/princeanil,New Delhi,50
ladakh,"This was my third trip to Leh. I've stayed in budget hotels in Leh and either they are a mess or they are expensive for what they offer. I think I've found a good balance in Hotel Munhsi Continental where the rooms are large, the prices reasonable and the location is fantastic, close to the market. They have a bar and good food at reasonable prices.",Umaid S,/Profile/umaids,Mumbai,40
ladakh,"a mid budget hotel which provides very comfortable stay. location---close to market and away from the crowd---ideal. rooms--don't need anything else actually. decent and cosy. food----good,non spicy,well cooked, and I thought it was ideal in avoiding sickness. In any case, it's              right next to Tibet Kitchen restaurant in case you want a more exotic meal sometime. staff----very helpful , smiling and decent owners--- a Doctor couple who are very warm  Extra---- take good care if you fall ill.",nandwanis_jsr,/Profile/nandwanis_jsr,"Jamshedpur, India",40
ladakh,"When it comes to Hotels dont expect to have a hotel with a good spa, swimming pool (anyways its freezing out there) or multiple restaurants when you travel Leh (Ladakh).  Most hotels are spartan in appearance, and offer just basic ameneties...a 24*7 restaurant and 32 inch tv is considered as luxury!  But when it comes to service this particular hotel blew us away, you are welcomed with a bright smile a warm cup of coffee/tea and a nice silk souvenir from Ladakh!  I have to say that in my thirty years of travelling I was never taken care off so well anywhere even at the greatest hotels in the world.  The minutest details are taken care of, like they knew that we are from Gujarat and we love to have butter milk with our meals...or for that matter poha (or as we call it in gujarat",Dhaval Thakker,/Profile/Dhaval_the_explorer,"Vadodara, India",50
ladakh,"Decent hotel for budget travellers...the location of the hotel is also close to the main market. For low budget travellers, the property is quite decent. staff is courteous and polite. Remember to book the larger rooms here. Views as always from the hotels are quite good. decently recommended",vohra_raghav,/Profile/vohra_raghav,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"Stayed here for 5 nights off and on over 2 weeks - as part of a tour group.  The hotel was ok ... at best.  The staff is friendly enough, the food was ok when we did eat there.  The wi-fi barely worked, and power is a problem in Leh it seems.  They do burn wood as noted by the first review... can cause smoky problems for the back rooms.  Rooms are dated, clean, but not super clean - carpets are borderline disgusting.  Bathrooms clean, the water hot ...   I'd seek out a different place the next time I came to Leh on my own.  There's an outdoor area with tables, but no umbrellas to shield from the burning sun...",goozey,/Profile/goozey,"Salt Spring Island, Canada",30
ladakh,"We had a very good experience of this hotel when we stayed there in the first week of July'12. The rooms are very clean & spacious. The food was good. The staff is helpful & courteous. I especially loved their welcome, where they offered tea/coffee immediately on arrival, which felt really nice after a long journey.  Overall its an excellent place to stay & enjoy your holidays in Ladakh.",alka14,/Profile/alka14,Nashik,50
