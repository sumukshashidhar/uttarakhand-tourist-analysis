ladakh,"We could stay very comfortably in this place run by a local family. It was like home! We could feel that they hosted us from all their heart. The place is a little outside Leh centre, about 15 minutes to walk to Changspa Road, so it's perfect to escape the trouble. They have a beautiful garden and a nice view from the balcony. The family is always ready to help if you need anything. After arriving you don't want to leave again.",Ali B,/Profile/alibB1698UB,,50

ladakh,"We stayed in DAWA GUEST HOUSE.And I must say, staff and owners were absolutely down to earth, very accomodative for every small request made, always smiling and serving attitude. I would say ""Dawa Guest House"" Is Absolutely perfect example of ""Home Stay concept"". Till today I could not forget the happy, positive and smiling faces of Mrs.Kunzang Dawa, Mr. Dawa(Owners) and Lamo 1 and Lamo 2(Staff).I would cherish them all forever for their happy, smiling, positive and down to earth attitude.  You all made our stay comfortable, pleasant and memorable  Mr. Dawa was kind enough to take us to local hospital when we were feeling down and also helped us in reaching the airport on time while leaving Leh.

ladakh,"We booked DAWA GH for a family vacation based on the reviews on TA. The moment we stepped in to the guesthouse the warmth in the reception was palpable. We felt as if we knew the DAWA family since ages. What's more important is the fact that the rich reception was extended till the last day of our stay. Not only was the food quality & quantity excellent but the respect love & affection with which the food was served made us feel that we had a second home in Leh. All the guests (Indian & Foreigners) were so happy & smiling, which created an immensely positive atmosphere overall. The minute attention to the health of each guest on the first day to the caring help for dropping & picking up the Ladakh marathoner who was our coguest spoke louder than words of the concern & attention",DRPRPANDIT,/Profile/DRPRPANDIT,"Mumbai, India",50

In our 13 nights trip in Kashmir, stay in Dawa for 5 nights was really best. Don't choose this homestay if you are looking for luxury like imported furnitures, extra cushion bed, 100 dishes for breakfast, seem less internet. Rooms here are very clean and neat with good space. No doubt food is one if the highlight with homely touch, internet is on &off. You will definitely enjoy ur stay if above requirements are considered.

I am sure the kind of warmth you get at Dawa, you will hardly find it at any five stars. We were 4 couples who booked Dawa for 5 nights for our 8 days stay in Leh and it was just FANTASTIC. While leaving the place, we all felt, we left a bit of us at Dawa. The guest house is run by husband - wife duo along with their 2 daughters and have spacious 9-10 bedrooms ensuite bathroom and view ofcourse. Food is super in taste and very affordable in pricing.

ladakh,"We are a relatively big family (2 parents+3 children).   Dawa Guesthouse was our home for 8 unforgettable days and nights.  Dawa is perfectly suited for the family stay: it is strategically situated in a very quiet local neighborhood ‚Äì away from noisy crowds of Main Bazaar and hordes of backpackers and honking taxies of Changspa, and still very close to everything a family on vacation may need: walking distance to city center (10 min pleasant shortcut by a shady inner lane), relatively close to Shanty Stupa, and close to the Tsemo Gompa mountain path. Spacious, clean and comfortable rooms (we occupied the entire floor), well maintained facilities, and big balconies overlooking Leh Palace and Tsemo Gompa (what the views in the sunset! and the relaxing silence!).

Dawa uncle and aunty are very sweet ,caring and talkative.They helped us a lot during our health issues. Uncle,aunty and their daughters served us food like a family member.

Dawa and Kunzung treat all their guests like family. They are the most genuinely sincere and loving people. I fell sick for a few days and they brought me to the doctor and made sure all the food they prepared for me was easy on the stomach. The food is delicious - the best in town. The rooms are beautiful, the beds immensely comfortable, and everything is super clean. The views from the guesthouse are wonderful - you can see the monastery, the palace, Shanti stupa and most importantly - the beautiful Himalayas.

She was so generous that she offered me to wash my clothes which I politely refused but she was like- let me do it for you, you are like my son. I have never experienced such thing ever.

I say that because, if somebody serves you egg every morning in the breakfast, then it's not a right home-stay because Ladakhi's don't eat egg every day in breakfast. That's just one example, rest you know what I mean to say. It is a bit far from the crowded city areas (especially the Changspa Road), which I liked because it was peaceful and serene.

What I liked the most was the Home Cooked Food and the area where we dined.  They served excellent Imported Tea from France on few days - which they now used to grow it in their own garden along with rest of the vegetables. I still remember Mint water that they used to serve us which we relished.  Only Issue was a foul odour in one of the washroom (Room 104) basin which continued to bother for 2 days and later it went away. Wifi was not working (Which is not a complain because we were on a holiday)  We accidentally left the only key to their room inside and were locked out.

ladakh,Stayed here during our ladakh tour.   Pros:   Cozy & spacious rooms Balcony with great views ( You can sit in the balcony and enjoy the mountains with intermittent IAF jets taking off every now and then) Clean washrooms with 24 x7 hot water Great food especially the breakfast. Also the place where we had food was awesome. ( nice floor mattresses with small tables.. Its fun when you're in a group.. ) It also has a pretty cool garden with home grown veggies.  Cons: No non veg food.   Overall a must stay if you're looking for a peaceful place a bit far from the market (not that far tho),Anik G,/Profile/AnikG37,,50

The guesthouse has great rooms, hot showers, and fresh, good food most of it straight from the garden. We were able to store a bag while we were trekking.

ladakh,"I have been to Leh four times over the last ten years. This is the best guest house I have stayed in by far. Mrs. and Mr. Dawa are amazing hosts. The location is perfect -- it is close enough from the center, but removed from dust and noise. It is a walking distance to Shanti Stupa, the old palace, downtown, and Namgyal Tsemo Gompa. It is minutes away from Sankar Gompa. Mrs. Dawa is an amazing cook, and all the vegetables come from her own garden. You simply cannot beat that. The house is well built, there is plenty of hot water. The guest rooms are on the second and third floor and you can see Shanti Stupa and Tsemo Gompa from the windows. The second floor rooms have balconies, and the third floor rooms have roof access. The part of town where the house is located is the best",Elina B,/Profile/332elinab,,50

The rooms are spacious with tons of sunlight pouring in, the washrooms are extremely clean and the view is delightful! Mr.Dawa and his beautiful wife are extremely polite and are immensely helpful.

Food by Mrs kunzum Dawa is delicious. I got to taste the local dish ""Chutagi"" as well and I loved it. They took care of me as my parents. Mr. Dawa even did not charge for the nights I could not stay at their place. Putting aside all my biases toward them, as an unbiased traveller I would strongly recommend Dawa guest house.

ladakh,"It's hard to say enough how this place is great and beautiful. I am still thankful that I could stay here during my trip in Ladakh. I stayed here more than 10 days, and eventually I didn't want to leave. If once you get there, you will know what I mean. :)  Concerning the location, I would say it's much better than noisy and crowded Changspa Road. Especially, there is some space among other houses, it has a stunning view. I really enjoyed the view with Leh Palace and Stok Kangri from my room (I stayed at the last end room on the floor and had 2 big windows. Wherever you stay, you'll get the bright shushine and beautiful view). It's really quite and peaceful. I also enjoyed sitting at the terrace toward Leh Palalce and reading the book. :) For cleanness, I bet it will be",leee586,/Profile/leee586,"Seoul, South Korea",50

Bonus: Mr. Dawa is well educated and well travelled man. We had long conversations on various topics including agriculture, tourism, governance etc. of the region. On showing a bit of interest in his garden, he passionately showed us and explained  plantations and how they take care of it.

ladakh,Guest house no less than house. The hospitality and the love showered by uncle and aunty (Mr and Mrs Dawa) was like the love by own parents. The food cooked by kunzang aunty was so healthy and tasty as she used vegetables grown in her own farm and cooked it wid love rather than cooking it as her task.

There is a variety of rooms all of which are comfortable and clean. If you don't feel like walking to town, save room for the amazing home cooked meals. It is also a good opportunity to discover authentic Ladakhi cuisine from locally grown produce, and cooked with love.

Extremely neat, clean and comfortable rooms, very hospitable , helpful and friendly host family and excellent food by Mrs Dawa made our stay unforgettable. Mrs Kunzung definitely needs a special mention for her sweetness, generosity and amazing cooking skills.
