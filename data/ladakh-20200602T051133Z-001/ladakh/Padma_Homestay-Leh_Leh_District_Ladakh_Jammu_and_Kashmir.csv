ladakh,"Hanle, the remote village in Ladakh has ample natural and wild-life beauty to offer. There no good options except very few. This place is best among all. The rooms are small but neat and clean with attached bathrooms. This place seems to be secured as have a boundry with ample parking space. The name is the owner's wife name. They provide an excellent hospitality and personal attention. Surrounding is just the village, enjoy an evening stroll in the beautiful breathtaking views. The power supply is available only for 3 hours 7PM to 10PM. The hot water is provided in the room in the bucket during morning.",indian302,/Profile/indian302,"Hyderabad, India",40
ladakh,"Hanle is a fairly remote location and chances are you will not find a soul on you way from Loma to Hanle. Once you reach the monastery, you will be surprised with the level of activity you see in Hanle. This place will leave a mark on your memory and what made is more enjoyable was Padma Homestay. It is the most popular home stay in Hanle and rightly so given that it offers good food, reasonably good stay facilities and all these with a smile and warmth. This place has many regular customers and thats what makes this place special. It was fun to meet wildlife photographers, hardcore trekkers and normal tourists at dinner time. Good food and interesting conversations with people from different backgrounds was memorable. Another big positive is they have a shop in the premises",Bhavesh K,/Profile/bhaveshrk,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Talking about remote areas, Hanle falls in such part of the country where you feel detached from the rest of the world. Padma Homestay, managed by its owner Mr. Sonam (a guide for bird/wildlife tour) is a great person. All the members of the homestay tried to make our stay a pleasant one. Rooms were well maintained and bathrooms were clean and equipped. If you are luxury seeker, Ladakh is not a place for you. I enjoyed Hanle and most of its credit goes to the comfort of Padma Homestay. Wish to visit again.",IndianTraveler2013,/Profile/IndianTraveler2013,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,The rooms are well maintained with attached bathroom. The food served was basic but excellent. The surroundings of the hotel offers great views and good for spotting many varieties of birds and Tibetan wildass,jkkartha,/Profile/jkkartha,"Kochi (Cochin), India",50
ladakh,"Hanle is  small remote village, close to the Tibet/China border. There are not many staying options here, and the best is Padam Homestay run by Mr. Sonam and his wife. There are dormitory-like rooms with a common bathroom as also individual rooms with attached bathrooms. Hot water is available when the electricity does not trip up. The common dining room tends to double up as a sleeping area when more guests land up...usually a troop of bikers.  Food is homely and tasty.",Pahari,/Profile/Pahari,Mumbai,30
ladakh,"Hanle being small village, there are not many options for accommodation. The owner Mr. Sonam is very good person and his family is very hospitable, homestay is named after his wife. We were group of 18 people and had very low expectation but the room, dining room and food was beyond our expectations. He also arranged fuel for our car at market rate of the fuel.

ladakh,We were welcomed here with warm tea after long ride. This town is on India-china border so what you expect on border town is opposite to what u get.  This place provide comfy stay good food options and feel like home stay. Although there isn't much thing around to do near this   Owner and staff was very nice and friendly ,Jaimin P,/Profile/JaiminP_13,,30
ladakh,"Overall: Be happy that you have a comfortable stay option. This is not the place to be fussy.  Pros: Rooms: shared rooms are good. Private ones were too dark to my taste. Location: This is a very small village, and in the remotest of places. What more can one ask for location? Sure, there is no dirt/ garbage around. Food: Good considering the place Bathroom: Shared bathroom is good, neat and clean. Though Indian style toilet. Hosts: Cheerful  Things to consider: Observatory: They don't allow visitors during the time when they operate. That is a big let-down. You cover 250 KM to visit a village - technically.",TusharKmr,/Profile/TusharKmr,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
ladakh,We have visited Hanley with an Idea to visit Indian Astronomical Observatory which is the worldâ€™s highest observatory. PADMA Home stay is an easily accessible place to the observatory and the owner of the place is a very keen birder and a wildlife passionate too.  The stay is basic and the food is minimum. But knowing the access to facilities at this place we were taken care well.,NANDANAIS,/Profile/NANDANAIS,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,"Padma and Sonam helped make the stay an experience like staying at one's own home. Unlimited tea when you ask for it and you just can't have one :) Awesome home made food and well - they go overboard to arrange stuff when the valley has scarcity of basic comforts. Don't expect 5 star comfort but a home stay - it's cosy, friendly and safe. ",anupamgupta,/Profile/anupamgupta,"Greater Noida, India",50
