ladakh,I stayed here 4 nights. Very nice guesthouse with a nice garden. The owner sings in the morning and all staff is very helpfull and friendly. Did not eat at the hotel so can not comment on the food. Love to stay there again.,ElP2015,/Profile/ElP2015,"Mannheim, Germany",40
ladakh,"The suite on the top floor corner at the entrance of the hotel had a great view of snow clad mountains on three sides. From the large windows and balcony of the front room of the suite you can spot the Leh Palace and a monastery on top of a small hill. The Shanti Stupa is visible from the large windows of the back room. Snow clad mountains are also visible from the big windows at the sides of the two rooms of the suite. The washroom is big and has good fittings. The Manager - Mr. Sangay and his wife were very cordial and always very helpful.  The owners Mrs Tshering and her husband were always in the vicinity of the hotel doing gardening/ farming , laundry etc.  On the first day of arriving in Leh when I got sick from the high altitude,  Mrs Tshering's husband and  the Manager",Daya,/Profile/Dayachali,,40

ladakh,"Very friendly and helpful people, sweet place to stay, quiet and recommended! Staying here was a lovely respite from long travels and it was a great atmosphere to be in near the centre of Leh but quiet, with its own garden.",Padma Aon,/Profile/326padmas,,40
ladakh,We stayed in this hotel for 2 days and we were a group of 4 friends. We enjoyed our stay and here is our opinion :   1. Location is great  2. The room has views of  Ladakh palace & Tsemo Maitreya Temple Or Shanti Stupa 3. Staff is good and friendly 4. Food is homemade and nice 5. The hotel has a small Apple and Apricot Orchard. When we visited trees were blossoming with flowers.   6. Cost of Food and room service is cheap.  7. View from Room balcony is good.   Cons  1. Not a problem with the hotel but with fellow travelers. We woke up around 4 in the morning because a group was leaving and making too much noise.    It's a nice property and we enjoyed our stay.,msharma554,/Profile/msharma554,"New Delhi, India",40

ladakh,"We spent a total of 5 nights here over a period of 2 weeks, while riding motorcycles around the Himalayas, and I must say the owner is an amazing woman and her team are awesome people. There were 10 of us in our group and nothing was ever a problem for the people at Zik Zik, the location is close and and easy walk to down town Leh, we at Breakfast there and had 2 dinners, the food was all fresh from her garden and what can I say, Wow, I live in the US and we get so used to food with manufactured flavor, here you eat what seasonal and grown fresh, all organically. We stayed in the ""Up"" scale double rooms, they were nice, simply appointed but very clean and comfortable. I found the beds a touch hard for my liking, but this seems to be the theme in India. There are loads of dogs,",David L,/Profile/D6816KGdavidl,,50

ladakh,"If you love bug bites, this is the place to go :P  I was accommodated in their old building which happens to be infested with bed bugs, the very first night I had bug bites all over my body and I notified the staff about it (sadly this was my first bug bite experience so I wanted them to suggest me a solution probably a doctors visit should have been arranged by them) Instead they joked about it and said ""you have taken a cheap room so bug bites are normal"" {I was clueless ...should I laugh about it or be sad on their ingonrance}  When I told the manager about it She was also very candid about the bugs and said: ""The bugs have bitten Foreigners too .. what is so special?""  ... I sensed the mentality and asked for anything which might help, so they gave me an incense stick to",Rahul D,/Profile/dobhal87,"New Delhi, India",10
ladakh,"I just stayed here a couple of times whilst in Leh and I have to say the place was lovely! Simple rooms which couple do with bit of a scrub down (the walls), but the bathrooms were super clean and the shower was the best I've had in India.   The hospitality demonstrated was superb. So caring and friendly.   I would recommend booking a stay here in advance as they often book out with groups. Also I stayed in the more expensive rooms on the 3rd floor and the bathrooms and the view were exceptional.   Oh and the dinner is delicious! A buffet with a few options - generally only one meat - which was perfect as I'm vegetarian.   Would stay here again for sure. Good value for money and great location. Oh and a beautiful Ladakhi garden. ",janewhiskeysierra,/Profile/janewhiskeysierra,"Brisbane, Australia",40
ladakh,Hi it was nice stay at zik zik. prices for accommodation are very reasonable and staff and owner are very cooperative and hard working.thanku tani Bhai and our driver 'Tashi' . Place is very close to market and peaceful too ....one must try Apple's from front lawn......also my advice take 3rd floor rooms for superb view....food is ok but you can go to nearby market there are penalty of options there .....also try 'Punjabi dhaba' at the left towards army camp museum.,Vipin K,/Profile/VipinK432,,50
ladakh,Stayed in a double bed room at first floor for 3 days. Room was neat and clean. Room service is also satisfactory. Hot water was available for 24 hours. Wifi was terrible. It's only accessible from small lobby. Liked the garden at front. Tariff is competitively higher than other hotels/guest houses nearby at upper karzoo.,Anisul Islam,/Profile/anisulnz,"Skellefteå, Sweden",30
ladakh,Rooms were clean and tidy. STaff is very co-operative and helpful. Hot water was provided for drinking purpose on request. Shower has 24 hours hot water facility. Garden is a cool place to hang out and they allow you to eat apples from their garden.,Meeta S,/Profile/MeetaS59,,50
ladakh,When we arrived this guest house we were led to  third floor. Our rooms were booked by  F5 escapes.( An all women group )  since there is acclimatization problem at high altitude it was very tasking climbing up till third floor and you are absolutely short of breath (although I am being used to  routine physical  activity ). Although  the house keeper is sweet natured but the wifi is deficient in the rooms which is an absolute essential at places like these as no other net work catches. ( only bsnl postpaid) . You are forced to sit in the reception or garden to use the  wifi and there too the strength is very weak.  The food is just average. One has to continue using same set of towels and the bedsheets were not changed at routine basis. There was an incident that a heavily,Absdhand,/Profile/Absdhand,"New Delhi, India",20

ladakh,"I stay at Zik Zik Guest House in July 2015 for 6 nights while leading a group of women through F5 Escapes.  You know how, while travelling to new places, you look for old bonds? Zik Zik felt just the same.  But first the basics. The rooms were clean, spacious and very nicely ventilated. They are warm with wood paneling and flooring.The balcony sit out was amazing and we loved having our morning tea there as we greeted the sun. The service was amazing and whatever was requested of the staff, materialised in no time. The little organic garden in the compound and fruit-laden trees made of a great ambiance. I even tried helping them with tilling and it was so much fun. The location is perfect and the Leh market and all the cafes are few minutes away on foot.

ladakh,"It is a nice guest house with different quality of rooms depending on your budget. We stayed in the upper class of rooms and since we went to Leh in September which is not such a busy season we could easliy get the rooms at a decent price. The owner is nice and friendly, the food is average as is the case with elsewhere in Leh. There are cheaper options available than this one but we settled for this as we reached quite late at night and did not have much time left with us to explore.  They provide free wifi however it was not of such a good quality. Things we did not like were the services in the guest house like providing basic amenities like water, towel, toilet soap. They do provide water but we need to ask for it. We no have an idea of what are the basic amenities provided",Sarang138,/Profile/Sarang138,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",30

ladakh,"I stayed at Zik Zik Guest House in June 2015. I can say the rooms were nice with amazing views. The owners were very warm and accommodating.  Unfortunately for me I had problems with the altitude and was feeling sick a lot of the time(I wished this wasn't so)! However, the family were so kind and even took me to the hospital for some oxygen. I would definitely recommend others stay here. They treat you like a family friend and not just a guest.  Staff were also great.",Mahakhabbaz,/Profile/Mahakhabbaz,"London, United Kingdom",40

The warmth of the owners, the kindness of the staff, the sustainable gardens, the amazing..I mean super amazing food made by the cooks..just all made my stay here memorable. I was traveling with a group of wonderful women, and all were treated like family. It is places like this that leave an imprint of LAdakh on my heart. Yes, the scenery, the peace, all of that is beautiful.but one of the MOST beautiful memories of my visit, is the folks here at Zik Zik!!.",KDB21,/Profile/KDB21,"Alexandria, Virginia",50
ladakh,"Zik Zik Guest house is a very modest, comfortable home stay, run by the amazing Tsering Didi and her staff, including Jogi Bhaiya (cook, handyman, entertainer, all in one!) Didi really captures the spirit of Ladakh - with her cheery ""Juley Ji"", her untiring hard work and joyful spirit. Jogi's cooking is incredible, as are his stories. The charm of staying in Zik Zik is the people you meet here - staff, fellow travelers and owners. The rooms are comfortable but basic, there's hot water from the solar heater, and a lovely garden and apple trees to sit by and read a book on a lazy day in Leh.",rtd2_in,/Profile/rtd2_in,"Mumbai, India",40
