ladakh,"Overall I recommend going to Pangong Tso but I wouldn’t recommend an overnight stay - unless you’re staying elsewhere or camping. Some group was playing loud music, not respecting the sanctity of the place. Also you could hear people snoring in the tents next door, or talking loudly from 4am in the morning. Domestic tourists didn’t seem to respect the fact that other people were trying to get a night’s rest.  The drive over is phenomenal, and you’ll pass an area where there are marmots basking in the sun.  -The room- Toilets weren’t great (Western, but not clean), there wasn’t hot water and there were lots of spiders in the room.  Beds were very comfortable and warm.  -The food- Food was all vegetarian and quite tasty and healthy. Chai was good.  -The people- Staff were lovely,",Neha D,,,30
ladakh,"All the camp or cottage are there in front of Pangong lake, so as PANGONG PARADISE"". The camp was very stuffy, no air circulation in the camp. Toilet was just pathetic. Water was overflowing from the pipes. On the other side staff was very helpful. Food quality was really very good.",Champ,,,30
