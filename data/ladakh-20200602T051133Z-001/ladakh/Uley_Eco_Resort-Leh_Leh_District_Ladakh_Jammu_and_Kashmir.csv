ladakh,"Our full family vacationed at the property and we really enjoyed it. It is by the Indus and an amazing location. The staff went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and welcomed. Vinod who served us our meals, the person at the font desk who showed us the planets went out of their way to make us feel special. Any trip to Leh should include this in the itinerary. Enjoy Vinod's hospitality in the restaurant!",SGVGSGNG,/Profile/SGVGSGNG,,50
ladakh,"Uley Eco Resort is located 70 km west of Leh beside the Leh–Srinagar Highway and the Indus river in the village of Uleytokpo. Their altitude at 3.050m makes this the village an ideal stopover for acclimatizing to the challenging climate and altitude of Ladakh. Uley Eco Resort has nice cottages and huts, maybe they are bit expensive, but sharing rooms with other people makes them an ideal accommodation for spending the first days in Ladakh. For those tourists looking for sightseeing along the Leh–Srinagar Highway is a  great base for visiting the nearby attractions like the Gompas of Rizong, Alchi, Likir and a little farther away Lamayuru. For trekkers is a nice place to go trough the process of acclimatizing to the high altitude, because there is nearby trek paths to gain",Julian R,/Profile/924julianr,,50
ladakh,"Uley Eco Resort is an amazing place to stop for a cup of coffee/ tea & freshen up, just ahead of Khalse in a place called Alchi....around 2hr from Leh on the Leh -Kargil road. It is built on a cliff edge overlooking the Indus River in an apple orchard. We stopped for coffee and had perched in Gazebo.... at a height with amazing views of the Indus River and mountains on all sides. But if you wish to get away from city and relax or prefer to go treks nearby the resort has a number of cottages for hire.",arvind1000,/Profile/arvind1000,"Pune, India",50
ladakh,Best discussion was to acclimatize  n relax in Uley and not in leh (my recommendation to everyone who likes the quite and peaceful place than the busy streets of leh ) Uley eco resort ... hospitality made us feel so comfortable that even after extending a day  we didn’t want to leave the place . The place is simple and that’s why it makes it feel at home . Rooms r hexagonal making it little smallbut want to be indoors when in Uley . Food at the resort was excellent from traditional to multi cuisine they do a good job. Plus all organic veggies picked from their farm..Chef ji timoks the best I have had. Have rafting at different places including chilhing but this by far has been the best experience with so many rapids and some grade 4 too .. one spl note after chilling water dip,sju04,/Profile/sju04,india,50
ladakh,The place is very scenic. You can see Indus river from your room. There is a path to get down to the river bank. The resort is full of apricot and almond plants. Apricot juice from homegrown apricots tasted nice. The rooms are made of wood. The only negative to call out is that the rooms are quite small and food variety is limited. We found hotels in Leh having more food variety.,Mukeshc,/Profile/Mukeshc,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,"What a location! The Indus river gushing through below, surrounded by mountains. The resort itself is an oasis, lush green filled with apple and apricot trees, roses in bunches climbing as vines on your cottage walls. The food is so delicious and sumptuous and fresh and the way it is served is simply superb. Loved the service best of all! Full marks to the service.",Iris1926,/Profile/shree2me19,"Ahmedabad, India",50
ladakh,"On our way to Leh from Srinagar, initially this was another night halt, but when we reached the property we found that the stay was another experience to add to our journey. The owner and the staffs were very good. Beautiful view by the Indus river, nice garden with apple / apricot trees.",PBH09,/Profile/PBH09,"Mumbai, India",50

ladakh,We stayed at Uley at the end of our two week Leh & Ladakh trip for two nights. It was such a personal atmosphere. Home grown organic vegetables were such a treat after all the commercial stuff we had been eating. The food was delicious and the Apple wine to die for. The owners live on the resort and ensure your stay is comfortable and enjoyable.  A walk down to the Indus river that flows through the canyon is both a good workout and picturesque. Would definitely recommend this unique experience to one and all.,Randhawa,/Profile/RandhawaIP,,50
ladakh,"My trip to Ladakh started with a 2 days acclimatization in Uleytokpo (3'050 instead if 3'500m), and surroundings as Alchi, Lamayuru etc. I really enjoyed my staying in one of the bungalows at Uley Eco Resort, where I could benefit from a very good accomodation with an amazing view of the valley. I also found an excellent food (they serve their own cultivated organic food) and an amazingly helpful staff. I've to say that the place is quite secluded and therefore better for couple or groups than for solo travellers, and biggest problem: your european mobile will not work there (as in the rest of Ladakh) and no wifi will be available, so be ready for that.",PaoloCichen,/Profile/PaoloCichen,"Milan, Italy",40

ladakh,"We wanted to stay at an easily accessible place on Leh-Kargil highway to explore  various Monstaries, enjoy  natural beauty,  visit the famous  Dha & Hanu  villages and enjoy the drive  along the Indus River! It didn’t take us much to zero down on Uley Eco Resort - and indeed we discovered  an explorer’s  El Dorado! A wonderful resort on the banks of Indus river, sprawling garden with colorful flowers, grand view of the majestic  Zanskar Range,  clear blue skies and abundant availability of  fresh apples and best Apricots!   Very elegantly designed  and thoughtfully furnished cottages overlooking  the mighty Indus river! Each cottage had a small sit out area to enjoy a cup of tea in perfect setting!

ladakh,"A stop on the road from Leh tot Kargil. Very friendly staff, especially manager Ganesh. Welcome drink, Our youngest asked for french fries and there they were ! Nice location, good food.  The manager arranged us a rafting on the Indus next-door which was adventurous and well-arranged.  My compliments !",gezinbilzen,/Profile/gezinbilzen,bilzen,50

You can walk down to the river and enjoy the time. Vibrant panoramic view of blue sky and mountains. Restaurant is well decorated and staffs are also well behaved.

ladakh,"We were a group of 12 hikers who truly cherished the resort. We had navigated 2 mountain passes and after 5 hours of hiking we were desperate to clean up and rest. The resort was the perfect place for that: quiet, comfortable cottages with nicely equipped bathrooms, beautiful gardens, impeccable service and the luxury of an onsite spa facility. We all got massages and enjoyed the good food. I highly recommend this place.",Eleonora_PH,/Profile/Eleonora_PH,"Manila, Philippines",50
ladakh,The Resort is situated along the Leh highway. The reception has friedly staff and the welcome drink is Apricot juice which is delcious and fresh. The rooms are decent but the solar powered water heaters do not work correctly. The resort has a vegetable patch which supplies fresh vegetables at the dining hall. The natural surronding and the flowers in the premises are very beautiful. The Indus river is just a 10 minutes walk down and the hotel arranges for a guide to go with tourists free of cost. The food is very good and fruits like mangoes are also served at the table. They have their own bakery so cookies and breads are a treat to enjoy.,Nilma S,/Profile/nilmas2017,"Mumbai, India",50

ladakh,"A neat, clean, quiet, star-rated resort with many amenities, each cottage having a seating area outdoors for guests to enjoy the majestic setting of the premises and the landscape.  The property sits on the banks of the Indus and the river is very accessible.  Though it is just off the highway the many Apricot and Green Apple trees block all sound and provide a contrast to the brown mountains around. The spacious cottages for two had comfortable beds, warm blankets and clean linen.  The bathroom was adjacent to the cottage.  No WiFi is available and the solar water heaters were non-functional.  Electric power was consistent.  Hot water for bathing was readily available after we were moved to another cottage. The welcome drink of Apricot juice was a treat.  The buffet style",Mayur S,/Profile/135Mayur,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,We were exhausted from our journey when we reached here. We drove 18 hours straight from Srinagar. But the moment my 70 year old father saw the place and their fields he ran to the fields and started working with the staff in the fields 😋😆! We could stay only for one night and we were running delayed on our trip. They happily offered 70% cash back or move forward the dates subject to availability. We moved the date and stayed for one night. Food was amazing and some of the produce was from their farms ...many items are Organic and it's a delight. It's close to the banks of Indus river that's another plus. Staff was very kind and polite ..wish we could stay for longer. Next time for sure !! ,Minoti S,/Profile/minotis501,,50
ladakh,The place is absolutely inthe lapf nature. A blend of comfort with scenic beauty is not so common in such a high altitude place. People are very helpful. The place is st next to a flowing river. Though its on the high way but hardly any noise can touch you and your holiday other than nature. Surrounded by mountains all around. Though these mountains are not very green but this resort is absolutely green. They have their own green kitchen garden. Vegetables are grown there. Lots and lots of Apricot and Green Apple trees. Rooms are cosy and warm. Night time if you want to gaze the sky you can see the stars the milky ways and lot more. Amazing place.,Sk_mahua,/Profile/Sk_mahua,Mumbai,50
ladakh,This place is very romantic for couples. We had a great time there with a great view on the river and the mountains. The cottage is decorated very luxury although tv and wifi were missing.

ladakh,"The resort is situated on the banks of Indus river on Leh-Srinagar highway approx 70 Kms from Leh. The near by attractions are Alchi (~1 Hrs drive) and Lamayuru (~2 Hrs drive).  The best thing about the resort is the location. The resort is on the lap if mountains with beautiful surroundings. It was extremely pleasant to sit on chairs on cottage lobby, having cup of hot tea, with no noise except of fluttering wind.  We choose deluxe cottages for our stay as they have attached toilet and bath. Standard ones have common toilet between 2 cottages. Hot water is available as they have solar heaters installed.  Food was acceptable as it lacked variety. Many items were repeat in lunch and dinner and they are never on time. 2-3 hours of delay in starting lunch or dinner is very obvious",Mihir Shah,/Profile/mihirshah161281,"Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,Four of us (2 couples) did a one night stay at Ule Eco Resort during our week long sojourn in Ladakh. We halted here on the Alchi - Lamayuru leg of our trip. The cottages are located beautifully in the lap of mountains with excellent views on all sides. The dining area has a outdoor section which boasts breathtaking views of Ladakh! We sipped hot cups of tea watching the sunset! The food is good and prepared hot and fresh. The owner stays within the resort in his own cottage and is very friendly. The bathroom is attached but outside the cottage. Hot water was available at all times which is commendable in such a remote area since they had solar heaters installed. Beds were very comfortable and we slept very well without any bugs bothering us. It was a most satisfying experience.,Pritam_Assrani,/Profile/Pritam_Assrani,"Mumbai, India",50
