ladakh,"I arrived at this hotel on my way back from Nubra Valley. I was really sick when I came and the hotel staff immediately helped me check in and took over. They were kind to prepare appetizing meals for me and give me full comfort as I recovered from my upset stomach.   I am a solo traveller and I always seek service quality over comfort and this is where I found both. This hotel is nicely tucked in a green neighbourhood, away from city’s crowd and noise. I enjoyed a peaceful stay and tasty home-cooked meals as I recuperated.   I recommend this hotel if you are someone like me who values cleanliness, service, and good quality food. I especially enjoyed chatting with the staff who was very friendly and always seconds away from offering assistance! Glad I stumbled here :)",Kanika G,/Profile/Lifeoutside2by2,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"We were there on a vacation. The hotel is little away from the market. Has a good view of the mountain and very close to the shanti stupa. When we were there the hotel was having too many visitors but had only three or four men to serve. So it was little difficult, but the staff is very helpful particularly the boy Islam (moonmoon) who always work with a smile. The owner of the hotel was previously working with NDTV a nice man and knows a lot about Ladakh. The rooms are spacious and food is good. Still the facilities are very basic. A small toilet kit in the bathroom and blankets with less deodorant smell will be highly appreciated.",debasis2k,/Profile/debasis2k,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"Stayed in last week of June, the hotel rooms are spacious and clean with all amenities. Food is very good and the strength of the hotel. Location of the hotel is the weakness as no views and also far off from the market.",Vipul J,/Profile/VipulJ1905,"New Delhi, India",40

ladakh,"Stayed at the hotel between end of August and beginning of September. The service offered is good for the money charged. The staff is courteous and ever smiling. The food served is good too. If you are looking for star kind of service this might not be the one but for a location like Leh, they are good enough. The rooms are well maintained and equipped.",foreverdeeps,/Profile/foreverdeeps,Mumbai,40
ladakh,I stayed at this hotel as part of package booked through Yatra.com.  Pros ------- a) The staffs were helpful b) Rooms are spacious and clean (though after we came back from Pangong we were given a room full of hair and dirt but when we complained they instantly cleaned it)  Cons --------  a) Running hot water is available only at specific time of the day - one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening. When we reached the hotel from airport there was no hot water available and we had to freshen up with the ice cold water only.  b) Food is just average. The hotel serves veg in the afternoon and non-veg in the evening (chicken is available only 3 days a week).  c) Not enough to do in the surroundings. You can't walk to the market. Cab fare is 150 one way and I am still,saurav_chat,/Profile/saurav_chat,Kolkata,30
ladakh,Its what you are paying for. When you go to a place like Leh you obviously wont and cant expect 5 star luxury. Hospitality is a huge plus. People respond to the calls at the reception and are available when you need them. Food is just about acceptable but again luxury is something that is not expected. The view from the rooms is nice and the stay was overall a comfortable one.,Mandira B,/Profile/mandirab2015,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,I visited Leh ladakh in the month of May 1st week. I went through yatra.com. Its official hotel for yatra customers. Hospitality services are best in class. Food is buffet breakfast/ lunch /dinne is awesome. Servers scheduled menu including veg and nonveg both. Serves team coffee etc in room at your specified time. YOu can ask them to schedule you moring wake up time and to serve tea. Hot water is supplied twice a day 1 hr each in morning and evening. DTH/LED tv in each room.  Over all a nice experience with yatra.com. Hospitality offered is best.,yash c,/Profile/yashc696,"Hyderabad, India",50
