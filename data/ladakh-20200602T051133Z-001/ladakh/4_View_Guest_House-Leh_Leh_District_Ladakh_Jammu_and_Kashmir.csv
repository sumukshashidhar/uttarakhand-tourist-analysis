ladakh,We had a wonderful time here during our ladakh trip. Rooms are excellent with nice view. Food is awesome and homely. All the basic amenities are there in the room. Hot water is available. The hospitality of the owner really amazed us. Would really love to travel there again.,priyodob k,/Profile/PK1990,"Bengaluru, India",50
