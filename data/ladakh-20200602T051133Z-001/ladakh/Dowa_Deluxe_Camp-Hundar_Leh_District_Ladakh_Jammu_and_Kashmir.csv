ladakh,"We stayed there overnight, nice place to stay , Food options are really good .They need to have at least an intercom since camps are away from reception room so in case of any need we need to rush across. Though getting continuous hot water is challenging but at least sufficient quantity of it should be arranged. Rest all is good. Fire camp could be better organized with some arrangements.",SMFirstTrip,/Profile/SMFirstTrip,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30

ladakh,"We five couples drove to Dowa Delux Camp in Nubra Valley on 12th July. We reached at around three in the afternoon. We were greeted by the staff who gave us a welcome drink. The tents provided were too good. The staff asked us as to what we would like to have for dinner. They provided us vegetarian meals which was very tasty. After dinner, we got around a bonfire and all of us danced and sang. The night stay was very comfortable. Since we had to leave early morning the next day, the boys packed our breakfast very nicely and handed over to us. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay ",Arunverma,/Profile/Arunverma,"Amritsar, India",40
ladakh,"We stayed here for only 1 day. It was raining when we reached here. The tents are clean and have basic amenities, with attached washrooms which have walls and eiling unlike the tent. The hotel staff is very responsible and are always on their feet. The food is also very good. They grow organic vegetables in their backyard. Nubra is on a lesser height so the weather was very pleasant throughout our stay. Hot water is also provided in the morning. And the famous Camel Safari on sand dunes is also nearby. We also saw a cultural show nearby. Our experience was great.",Himani R,/Profile/himanirana107,"New Delhi, India",40

ladakh,Visited Nubra Valley as part of my road trip from Mumbai to Ladakh. Was recommended this resort by the hotelier at Leh. Not disappointed. The tents were clean and well maintained. The plus was the clean toilet. However the running hot water was not available in the morning. Food was basic but palatable. Staff was friendly. A major problem was locating the resort. If travelling with your own vehicle it is advisable that you reach Hinder well before sundown since finding the resort can be a problem. Would have wanted to stay longer but the resort was closing down for the winter. All in all highly recommended.,Rinchen W,/Profile/bobbywangdi,"Mumbai, India",40

ladakh,Though  Camps is a fairy new concept in Indian holiday trips  but in past two decades it has gained some great popularity .But camps have often become luxury tents as used to be erected for Maharajas or Sultans when they were on long hunting trips or war front will all the basic and some luxurious amenities . Dowa come with a different concept and as far as i remember the tents i have stayed this was a great and different experience to feel the nature much closer .  Pros :- 1. The first impression was the best one when your urban road ends up to stone trails and no road leads to to camp boundary of  a stone wall evenly placed by hand in a side of a river bed   2.  15 nice tents which you can call semi luxury with a nice double bed  and nice tent balcony which opens up to the,indrajit s,/Profile/Indrajit_Bublu,"Kolkata, India",50
