ladakh,"My first trip to Ladakh. I had selected this hotel for my Leh stay. Stayed here twice in span of 8 days in September 2019. Once for 3 nights and other for a single night.  There is no need to describe the location. Leh is anyways spectacular and for a Mumbaite like me its peaceful and serene. I checked in early morning at around 8.00 am, the checkin was smooth and i was given a room in the new wing. The Hotel has two wings main one and an annexe kinda building. My Room was 704 in annexe. Mind you Annexe doesnt have lift so need to climb up 3 floors. Room was clean and spacious. Wifi was free (though the signal is very weak and i had the wifi router right outside my room.

ladakh,"I stayed at the hotel with my family during our visit in leh. We had pre booked through a travel agency and based on the prices charged we were expecting a decent stay there. Following are the cons and pros I found during my 4 nights visit (2 in beginning, 2 in end) at this hotel:  Cons 1. The hotel is not on main fort road as they claim. It is inside some small alley and even the local taxi drivers were not aware of the location. It was a nightmare searching for the hotel and explaining to taxi drivers where it would be.  2. There is a dedicated reception area however the staff doesnot like to be at the reception area. There is no dedicated receptionist and the staff keeps on wandering here and there.
