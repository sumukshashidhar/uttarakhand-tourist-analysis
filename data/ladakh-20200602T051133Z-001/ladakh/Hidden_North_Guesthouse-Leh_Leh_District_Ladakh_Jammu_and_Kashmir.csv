ladakh,"We had an amazing experience when we visit Hiddennorth GH in Phyang, Ladakh. The village is only 30 min. drive from Leh and it is a very nice, photogenic and peaceful vilage. It is worth wondering around for a couple  of hours. The guest house is surrounded by a beautiful garden where vegetables are grown  and a lot of flowers.   Cristina who run the place is very very kind  and helpful. The food that she is cooking  is delishes. We had great experience. ",Amos G,/Profile/amosg350,"Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut, Israel",50
ladakh,It was such a lovely surprise to arrive here. The hosts are great and I appreciated being able to spend some time with Christina. Was wonderful to have good conversation and discuss some questions I had about my visit to Ladakh. My room was beautiful with a spectacular view. Really appreciated the home cooking and fresh produce from the garden. I enjoyed the walk around the valley in the morning and I would highly recommend Hidden North to any travellers.,Elisabeth W,/Profile/liswernli,"Cambridge, New Zealand",50
ladakh,"We stayed here for 4 nights either side of our trek with Hidden North Adventures and loved it! Cristina was so friendly and welcoming, and cooked delicious, wholesome meals which included a lot of vegetables from her organic garden. The views from both rooms we stayed in were spectacular. The location was perfect for us: 30 minutes from Leh in a quiet village, so we were able to do a couple of day  treks straight from the doorstep. Tashi (Cristina's husband) arranged a taxi into Leh for us when we wanted (there's also a daily bus service).",meganshaw2018,/Profile/meganshaw2018,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,Hidden north is a hidden gem in Ladakh. Go there if you expect a quiet and friendly atmosphere. Sit down and relax or take a hike in the beautiful surrounidngs. Christina runs her guesthouse with Swiss accuracy and Ladakhi friendliness.,X P,/Profile/484ellenp,,50
ladakh,"I stayed here in March 2016 and fell so much in love with it I could not wait to return with my wife. It took two years but we made it. This location is well away  from the bustle of Leh so transport is needed. The building is fairly new having been built from scratch following a disastrous flood in the Phyang Valley a few years ago. There are 8 letting rooms of various grades and we tried both 4 and 8 ('my' old room from 2016) which is more spacious. Both are self contained/en suite. Meals are taken in a purpose built dining hall and are all prepared in house and often shared with the owners (and now firm friends) Cristina and Tashi and young son Tashi Namgyal. English, German and Italian is spoken as well as Ladakhi and Hindi. Our hosts are very warm and friendly and we hope",mfuwe,/Profile/mfuwe,"Isle of Man, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"I spent five weeks in Ladakh last fall and one of the highlights was staying with Tashi, Christina and their son in Phyang. My guesthouse room was extremely comfortable and clean with an out-of-this-world view. I loved spending time in the beautiful garden talking with Christina about life in Ladakh.  The walk up the valley into the mountains above the guesthouse was spectacular.  The walk through the charming village of Phyang spread down the river valley from the guesthouse was equally interesting.  The Phyang Monastery is ancient, full of treasures, and not to be missed. All Christinaâ€™s meals were delicious and home cooked, often with ingredients from the garden.  Staying with the family is special and highly recommended.

ladakh,"Hidden North is a lovely guesthouse, located in a quiet village where it is worth spending a couple of days to enjoy the sights, the walks, or simply the peace and simplicity of a country place. We had a spacious, beautiful, spotless room with a great panorama. Crisitna runs the guesthouse with incredible efficiency together with warmth and friendliness. She is a great source of information about Ladakh. She is also a great cook, the meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) were all delicious, wholesome, made from scratch, including salads from the garden. Meals are served in a nice common room, which added to the atmosphere of the place.",annajurgen,/Profile/annajurgen,BergamoItalia,50
ladakh,"Christina and Tashi built an oasis in the mountains. Being there was unforgettable experience. Everything there : the garden, the super fresh and tasty food, the rooms and above all the atmosphere. Quite and vivid. We had the best time there.",alma c,/Profile/almac659,"Tel Aviv, Israel",50
ladakh,"What a wonderful find. I decided on an early start to my organised trip and found by chance ""Hidden North"". From first contact I received a very warm feeling from the owners, Tashi and Christina, and really started looking forward more to my stay with them than the main trip I had booked on. Responses were always prompt and helpful and indeed I booked two day excursions with Tashi for more wildlife viewing. Both days were excellent. Indeed there was a third half day as having rested from my early arrival, to aclimatise to the altitude, I was persuaded/encouraged to get out and find some rare and sought after birds without wasting time on such mundane matters as lunch. Christina took all this in her stride. My room was large, and well lit by large windows, with views down the",mfuwe,/Profile/mfuwe,"Isle of Man, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"a lovely place with lovely hosts - it is THE place to spend your first days in Ladakh to acclimatise or to rest after your trekking. wonderful house and rooms with a great view and all of this set in a lovely quiet traditional village, monastery included. we enjoyed so much being away from the hustle of Leh and still the city is only a short taxi ride away. hosts Cristina and Tashi bring the best of both worlds (east and west) together and so your are all set to be well taken care off in the beautiful himalayas!",BeaWittwer,/Profile/BeaWittwer,"Canton of Bern, Switzerland",50
ladakh,"Highly recommended, very clean, spacious and beautiful guesthouse with an amazing garden in an inspiring, peaceful environment with wonderful hosts - Cristina and Tashi - who immediately make you feel very welcome. The food is very tasty and most of the vegetables are from their own garden. This is a perfect place to acclimatize before starting a trekking while familiarizing oneself with the Ladakhi culture / habits / geography through informative discussions with the hosts or to spend a few relaxing days after a trekking.",LilianGil,/Profile/LilianGil,"Basel, Switzerland",50
ladakh,"Great place to stay if you want to be out of the city in a small village. Love Phyang and love this place. Tashi and his wife are very helpful and organized and easy going. The location is stunning and the rooms very nice some with attached bath. It is a ways out and is not so convenient if you want to go regularly to the Monastery nearby. Ofcourse it is a good 40 minutes by taxi to Leh and longer by bus, but if you have time to relax and take it easy it is a lovely place. Tashi organizes treks and others adventures and helped us organize taxis to Lama Yuru. He was very good. Just need to be aware of the possibility of flooding in Phyang in summer as rains are coming there more frequently and can get mudslides in Phyand easily. Hidden North is safe as they moved to a location",yeshezangmo,/Profile/yeshezangmo,"Faloppio, Italy",50
ladakh,We arrived in the evening and after 10 min talks we decided directly to stay 2 nights although we had different plans. But the family run guest house is exactly what you expect as an European - Ladakhi charme combined with the european idea of service. The dinner is almost organic and fresh from the garden and the breakfast is a nice mix of ladakhi and continental style. But the best thing is the mountain and valley view. If you're going to Ladakh and need time for acclimatization - best place to stay  some days- and you'll get all support for your travel. I'll definitely come back and it will be like coming home!,KaiT1972,/Profile/KaiT1972,"Lund, Sweden",50
ladakh,"Just spent two weeks volunteering at Tashi and Christina's guest house in order to prepare for the upcoming season. It's a lovely family providing a nice Ladakhy experience. On top of that, the view is amazing; when thinking about Ladakh, the Phyang valley has what all travelers are looking for in terms of landscape.",CH_1984_CH,/Profile/CH_1984_CH,"Leh, India",50
ladakh,"Just 30 minutes far from Leh, in a wonderful village called Phyang we discovered the best place to stay in Ladakh. At Hidden North Guesthouse, Cristina cooks delicious food and her husband Tashy organised cars to visit the best places of Ladakh and trekking itineraries. We spent 5 days in this peaceful oasis, away from the crowded Leh but at the same time close to the most important places to visit. It could be the best base to visit Ladakh! All the rooms have a wonderful view of the green fields, Phyang monastery and surrounding mountains. Cristina and Tashy are lovely persons and we met travellers from all over the world in this peaceful and relaxing oasis.   Dino and Veronica - Rome",Dino1976,/Profile/Dino1976,"Rome, Italy",50
ladakh,"Hidden North is a hidden gem! Only a 30 rupee bus ride away from Leh and you are in real Ladakh. The beautifully colourful village is overseen by a stunning monastery and there are stunning views from the guesthouse. Christina, the owner, works tirelessly to make you feel welcome and at home, cooking fabulous traditional meals with home grown produce. The rooms are large, light and fresh. There is solar hot water, towels. We used Hidden North as our base before and after a trek into Marka Valley using the expertise of their trekking agency (Tashi) to book the trek. It is a fabulous venue to rest up and recover. We look forward to our next visit. THANK YOU Christina and Tashi!",Fayemond,/Profile/Fayemond,Herts,50
ladakh,"Tashi Chotak and his Italian wife Christina do everything to make your stay comfortable and as close to a home away from home as possible in the harsh environs of Leh. The guesthouse is situated in a small village called Phyang, approx 15 kms short of Leh from the Srinagar- Leh side. great to stay away from the main bazaars and yet close enough for the distance not to bother one, assuming you have your own vehicle or access to one. The village has a lovely monastery at the heart of it and if you are inclined (like we were) you can stroll across at 6am in the morning for a session of chanting with the monks and a cup of their fabulous butter tea as you participate in their morning ritual.  The rooms at the guesthouse overlook the awe inspiring zanskar range on the horizon, the",Meanderer-Manjula,/Profile/Meanderer-Manjula,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"I stayed at the Hidden North GH on a couple of occasions during an extended stay in Leh from May-Aug 2012. The rooms are decent value for the price and the two that we stayed in on the upper floor had attached bathrooms. The views down the valley are stunning and Phyang is an excellent place to relax for a few days a short bus ride from Leh.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner are available at a reasonable cost and this is great because I am not sure there are too many other options in the village.  In short I would definitely recommend this place and hope to visit again one day",bluehoatzin,/Profile/bluehoatzin,"Brighton, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"I stayed at this guesthouse for 2 nights at the end of my trek. It was good to be resting here for 2 nights. Calm, friendly and hospitable host Tashi served great food and shared great stories. You can see he is quite dedicated to his profession as a guesthouse host and a travel agent.  It was indeed good to be here, sitting outside drinking hot tea and enjoying the view of the monastery was one of the best experience during my visit to Ladakh. I hope to go back again one day.",PravinDarjeeling,/Profile/PravinDarjeeling,Darjeeling,50
ladakh,"Great place with a large garden around the house for hanging out and enjoying the spectacular view. Some of the rooms have attached bath rooms and a large window front. Rooms are simple but very nice, the same goes for the meals. The staff is very attentive and helpful. It is a perfect place to stay for people who appreciate calm and beautiful surroundings. It is 20 minutes away from the hustle and bustle of Leh, taxis can be hailed very easily to drive in and out of Leh. We also did a trek (Markha Valley) organized by Hidden North and it was spectacular! I can highly recommend them; we will certainly be back for more!",Silvia H,/Profile/Swissfamily04,"Lausanne, Switzerland",50
