ladakh,"Excellent hotel by the banks of Suru River. We were delayed well past our intended check-in time thanks to the challenges of Zoji La. Nevertheless, the staff had warm food waiting for us in our room, even as we checked into the hotel at midnight. The rooms are large and tidy, well equipped and we had a nice view of the river flowing by. The food is very good - thanks to Chhutuk's hospitality we were able to enjoy a warm dinner after a long tiring ride from Srinagar and the breakfast buffet in the morning was filling and satisfying as well. The staff, led by Mr. Vikram, is very competent and we appreciate them for moving our reservation at our request and doing whatever they could to accommodate our specific case and needs. Overall, a highly recommend lodging option if you're",Malvika B,/Profile/90malvikab,"Columbus, Ohio",50
ladakh,The hotel is at a mindblowing location. Amazing property amazing food and wonderful service. The hotel looks grand on the outside. However I realised that not all the rooms were the same. The room that I was allocated was way too plain and simple and did not match one bit with the grandeur of the hotel on the outside.  Maybe if thatis looked in to then absolutely noissues. The hotel is just fantastic,rads2k,/Profile/rads2k,"Chennai, India",40

There is beautifull hearthrobing fantastic suru River  view.such a beautiful view I ever seen in this area.Iwill be staying there again on my next trip.",Gulzar H,/Profile/222gulzarh,,50
ladakh,We had booked this place through a tour organizer and were taken completely by surprise. The location on the banks of the river just outside Kargil town is beautiful. The hire is modern and squeaky clean. Dining in the lawns with the river flowing by is quite an experience. The little bridge down the road takes you to a picturesque village on the other side.   I could have spent the entire holiday and it would have been well worth it.,Rohit Agarwal,/Profile/Rohgit,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
ladakh,A wonderful property and very new  at a fabulous location away from the hustle bustle and congestion  of the main city  in a quite corner by the water the rooms are very nice and comfortable with good food and with staff and management always there to assist you.

ladakh,"Recommended by our dear Friend Rigzin ( Journey to Ladhak), this hotel, perched right on the river was the perfect start to our Zanskar adventure. Beautifully located away from the bustle, clean and comfortable, with staff that were obliging with any requests. A few housekeeping chinks but they will get these ironed out.  After 3 days and a 10 hr return leg, the comforts of this hotel beckoned and we had a super last evening.  When in Kargil look no further.",Rushil S,/Profile/rushilshah71,"Pune, India",40
ladakh,"It's good property, you can enjoy your stay here with friends and family. Following is my review.  Location : (5 starts) Though hotel is in little outskirt of town, but it's just situated on river Bank, the view is mesmerising, a flowing river with greenary, hills and suspension bridge.  Rooms and bath room: (5 star) Rooms and bath rooms were clean and spacious.  Amenities : (5stars) Everything you needed is available.  Staf: (4stars) Stuf were good and well behaved, but it seems they are less in numbers and very busy specially in breakfast time.  Food: (4stars) Food was good and you will get many variety, we ate here full, after a long time, as the food we get in leh was OK, and we had spend there more than a week.  You will enjoy your stay here, I feel that this hotel is",fazal m,/Profile/501fazalm,"Thane, India",50

ladakh,We stayed at this hotel a few days ago.  When we arrived we were amazed with the scenery.  We met Mr Fayaz Ahmed who was very helpful to guide us with our itinerary.  He took the trouble to arrange special food for us.  This is the best hotel for our trip in JK and Ladakh,auntiedoris,/Profile/auntiedoris,"Ipoh, Malaysia",50
ladakh,"We checked in on 27th July for a night. The owner Mr Fida Hussain and his son were available near the reception and they helped us in organising our sightseeing around Kargil. The rooms are spacious, very clean and homely. The bathrooms are spotlessly clean. The breakfast and dinner were also very tasty and gave a homelike feeling.  We wish we had more time to stay and enjoy the hotel. The river flowing on the side gives the hotel a calm feeling and induces one to relax.  All in all, highly recommended and one must meet the enthusiastic owners and staff.",praveendiscovery29,/Profile/praveendiscovery29,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"This is an amazing hotel with an amazing view of Suru river. The location is a bit far off from the main town, but worth the extra 15-20 mins drive! the Rooms are well maintained with all basic amenities , food quality is very good. Highly recommended.",Gargi B,/Profile/GargiB15,,50
ladakh,"I stayed here last year and without a doubt, this was my preference when I visited ladakh this year. Its away from the hush-hush town of Kargil and the room window gives you the best view of Suru river. The food here is better than most of the restaurants/hotels you will find in metro cities and the hospitality is amazing. Rooms are well built with all modern day comforts/amenities you need. Good enough garden space to sit and enjoy within hotel premises with a good collection of flowers and tree shades.  Owner Fayaz is a gentleman (like most of the people you would find in Ladakh region.) Educated, well spoken and a good host.",vikas y,/Profile/vikasy184,,50

ladakh,Thank you to Mr Fayaz and his team. We had a wonderful stay at Chuttuk Heights. Located away from the town and right by the river side in beautiful Kargil. Very neatly appointed large rooms. All of us had a great time including our pet lab.  We went for a nice walk down the river and hung out at a suspension bridge close to the hotel. This was peace personified. A great stopover on your Srinagar to Leh trip.,axemathur,/Profile/axemathur,Delhi,40
ladakh,"It's an amazing hotel with great view, I think the best when you plan to stay in kargil. I have been there twice, first time in June 2017 and then in July 2018. Both the time, I was impressed with their hospitality. I didn't want to stay in main kargil so we drove further and came across this property last year, I guess it was newly built then. It is hard to believe that so far from home one can get a fabulous food but I had one of the best food, specially the paneer was the best I had in my life. The hotel is very modern in feel and has a great ambience inside and outside. I know where to stay when in kargil 😇😇",anjali r,/Profile/anjalir252,,50

Food that we tried was butter chicken, dal makhani, vegetable raita and roti. It was worth the stop and we managed to have food twice while going to Zanskar and while coming back. The hotel gives a very good view and we missed out the opportunity to stay here due to lack of time.  Cheers guys!!! Keep up the good work 👍🏻",Gurbir,/Profile/KangGurbir,"Chandigarh, India",50
