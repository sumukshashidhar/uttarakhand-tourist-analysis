ladakh,"Frankly speaking, one the cheapest camp available throughout the town. The tents were really clean but I must not say well maintained. As you can notice in the picture, the tents lacks tarpaulin on either sides thus in case of rainstorm, the water starts pouring in from the corners. However the owner, and other staffs are very nice, welcoming and very helpful. The food is also great. What pleased us most is the behaviour of the owner and other staffs.  We were first allocated the tents on the right hand side (in the picture below), which after a hell of a rainstorm, got wet and couldnâ€™t keep up with the same. However upon notifying them, they shifted us to the tents on left hand side which were of good quality and standed still even after the rainstorm. Well I really cannot say",Krishnandu Sarkar,/Profile/Krishnandu,"Kolkata, India",40
ladakh,"One of the worst places I have ever stayed in ever. It is understandable that the location is remote, but that isn't an excuse to provide dirty tents, filthy beds, and torn blankets which don't work. We reached here by late evening, had booked online earlier, which was a huge mistake. The website and pictures are misleading, and the camp is horrible. Donkeys roam around in the campus, waking you up in the middle of the night by their noises.  There was literally animal-poop lying outside one of the tents, which no-one bothered to clear up.  Food is okay but that isn't even the saving grace of this place. It was the worst experience ever, so much so that this ruined the beautiful Tso Moriri for us. Only wanted to get out of here as soon as possible.  Staff seemed to be okay, but",Akanksha Dureja,/Profile/AkankshaDureja,"New Delhi, India",10
