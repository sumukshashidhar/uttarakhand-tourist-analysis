ladakh,"Me and my wife visited for 6 nights from 22nd to 28th Jan 2020. The temperature was between -12 to -21Â°C. In this adverse weather the hotel provided best possible facilities. The food was very good,let me remind you that there is hardly any vegetables found in the market. Yet,they provided chicken, vegetables, dessert etc. The staff was very hard working and courteous. Mr Rahul, the owner is a fabulous person.Winters are rough in Leh but the hotel is at a walking distance from main market, so it was easy for us. The following is pic with the staff with us. They provided us heater and electric bed",Amal,/Profile/Amal1413,,50

ladakh,"Didn't know what to expect when we drove into White yak at LEH as per our tour operators recommendation. But the moment we stepped in, it was clear that this is going to o be a great experience. We were served tea at the reception and the manager- Rahul spoke to us advising us and enquiring us on our health post travel directly from Mumbai (low altitude) to Leh ( high altitude). The reception was so warm throughout, that it almost felt like a home stay.  Next and most important is the food. Since at LEH, most hotels have breakfast and dinner meal plans...this makes up most meals in the day. White yak was a pleasant surprise when I had my first morsel of breakfast. Not just the variety served but the taste was excellent. The cook is a simple man but the dishes he made were",shailaja r,/Profile/shyla162015,"Mumbai, India",50
