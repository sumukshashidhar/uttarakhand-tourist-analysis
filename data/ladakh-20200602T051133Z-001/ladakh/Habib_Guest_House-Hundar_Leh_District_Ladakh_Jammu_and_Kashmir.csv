ladakh,"It's a budget hotel with superb service. Especially Mr. Irfan is amazing. They serve delicious breakfast and dinner. In addition they are ready to customize your dishes, if you pay little extra. Rooms are spacious. Wifi speed to be improved. ",Baburajnair,/Profile/Baburajnair,"Coimbatore, India",40
ladakh,The guest house is very ordinary  having a plain room and a clean bathroom. So it is OK.  However we were happy with its location which is adjacent to the sand dunes.  The property has many trees and is very pleasant.  Location wise this has scored because of the beautiful views and greenary allaround.  Food was very basic but was served to us in chowki style that made us feel special. This guest house has accommodation in tents which are fantastic.  Please choose them instead of the guest house and then you can say your experience was five star.,Kusuma B,/Profile/664kusumab,"Hyderabad, India",30

ladakh,This review is for 19 & 20 November stay. We had booked 3 rooms (one 4 bed and two 2 bed) 3 months in advance by directly speaking with Mr. Irfan who is kind of manager at guest house. Because of few negative reviews was worried that they will reject the booking on arrival. But that didn't happen. Mr. Irfan kept in touch and assured that all is well. On last day he messaged that for urgent work he has to return to his home town but owner will take good care of us. His words turned out true.  The 4 bed room and one double bed room has kerosin heater which can run whole night. Other rooms have only small electric heater which will run only till 11PM. On first day the 4 bed room heater was leaking so we some how managed with small electric heater. Hot water was supplied in buckets.,Rajanish T,/Profile/JajaborRaj,"Pune District, India",40

Not far from this place you find I visit India's only two humped camel ride. Hospitality was too good. We had the best ever food ( fresh and tasty) amongst all the places in our trip here.

ladakh,My visit to Nubra was when i got the chance of staying here at Habib’s. Must say the location it is at is breathtaking it is right in center of the valleys that gives an amazing view. Coming to the rooms i wouldn’t say they were the best but neat and clean though they should keep the dustbins in the rooms which i did not find. Washroom was good with hot and cold water available but within time frames. They have a separate dining space which can easily accommodate 20 plus people. The package included breakfast and dinner   (Buffet). Food was pretty good and you get a variety of options to choose from for both dinner and breakfast. I will stay again at this place if i get a chance to visit again but this time in their tents. To sum it up i ll recommend you guys this place if you,J Vlogs,/Profile/jvlogs,"Dombivli, India",40

It was one of the best decision to do so as everything was perfect in this guest house. from concerned hotel staff to food everything was much more than our expectations and the location was just the cherry on the cake. hotel staff was very kind and we literally had home like experience on dinner table. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.,meyasmeen,/Profile/meyasmeen,,50
ladakh,Worst place to stay.Management is highly unethical.Even though you pre book online this hotel your not sure of getting confirmed rooms.Hotel rooms are sold out to person who pay higher price irrespective of your resrvation made.Upon arrival you can be in shock to get no vacant rooms.... Avoid this messy hotel,abhi420,/Profile/abhi420,"Indore, India",10
ladakh,"I stayed here on 6/7 February 2018. The facilities are decent. The room was kept warm by a real wood burning stove. Superb breakfast of freshly baked Ladakhi bread. wi-fi is available but only in the evenings.  I must specifically mention Irfan who was most attentive and helpful. I had enquired about the place on phone and was told that the charge would be Rs. 2800 per day. However when they saw that I was travelling solo, they reduced it to just Rs. 1500.   I would certainly recommend this place to Nubra valley travellers.",satishsjoshi,/Profile/satishsjoshi,"Thane, India",40
ladakh,"We had booked 4 rooms with Habib by paying advance amount for 1 room. We were delighted to see the property, though our visit turned out to be the worst of its kind when we came to know that they had cancelled our booking without informing us and had given to other fellow travellers. They started giving all the irrelevant reasons for doing so. After a day long journey, all we had to do is to look for other guest houses.

Never in our life did we see so many stars so clearly and we even got to see the milky way galaxy! How exciting is that?!!!!  The food was great, the room we were provided with was very clean and neat. Mr Irfan (Manager of this homestay) made sure our stay was very comfortable.

The food is very homely but we had our most memorable meals at Habib during our stay in Leh.

ladakh,Visited nubra and stayed at Habib guest house. No bookings were made before but I recommend the same if visiting between June-September due to high season and only 6 rooms available. Heater was provided to us for a rent of rs 300 per night.!! Room rate was rs 1500 a couple on map plan basis !! Hot water was made available in mornings via bucket though we didn't have a bath.

It is surrounded by the silver sand dunes and the majestic mountains in the front. This is a good place if you love photography and want to stay closest to the sand dunes.  The room which I got was just okay, but they have good rooms too. Homely food, hot water, hospitality and Wi-Fi are the some good features where you are almost cut-off from the world. Best thing about this guest house is that it is very economical and accessible.  Good Luck!!",viveksinha2015,/Profile/viveksinha2015,"New Delhi, India",40

ladakh,This is a beautiful guest house in Hunder. We stayed here for 1 night during our stay in nubra valley. It has a cosy rooms with attached bathrooms. Very affordable rates. They gave us 1 heater per room which did warm the room. On our arrival early evening they gave us warm tea and fried chips. At night they gave us home cooked food with hot rotis. In the morning and night they gave each room hot water in buckets. Outside temperatures was around -4 degrees. The important thing was that the rooms were well maintained and hence we saw that this little guest house was full within hours. The owner came and sat with us and was trying to make our stay as comfortable as possible. Will definitely come back in my next visit to this beautiful place.,Jimmy,/Profile/Jimmyb_1978,"Mumbai, India",50

Rooms were big, spacious and clean. Guest House is just adjacent to desert and one can have a walk there. Food is tasty and delicious . Hospitality they did was simply amazing and not even for a second you will feel that you are out of your home. One of the best thing I want to highlight here about Mr Habib is his trust and honesty. We were 5 guys and we ran out of money while coming back from Turtuk. There was no ATM nearby (Diskit has one ATM but it wasnt working).

Although not a must, we were looking for a 4-beded room.   On reaching Habib GH, the owner mentioned that his kitchen was burnt completely in a fire that morning and hence he will not be able to serve his specialty food but can arrange food from somewhere else. The guest house was completely empty owing to the unfortunate event. The guest house had a 4-beded room and he was offering us at a very cheap rate.

He helped us with endless supply of woods to keep the fire burning and even taught us how to use that old-school fireplace. His family provided us with hot water and oven fresh food whenever we needed it. We had our spicy egg-curry , the only non-veg meal in the entire trip there.
