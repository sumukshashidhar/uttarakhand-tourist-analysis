ladakh,"I visited Lchangnang in September with friends. We took warila route and reached the porperty at around 7pm tired. We were welcomed with warm hospitality and smiling faces. The managers explained every thing very nicely and the chef took exta care at dinner time with amazing presentation. They also planned our itinerary and we drove to Siachen side of the valley( it was worth it with the hot springs, lake and water fall). They also do village walk and stargazing at night before dinner but then we were tired and spent some time at the bon fire cum bar listening to some live music. You must visit this property to complete the ladakh experience. Kudos to the team.",Danethesane,/Profile/Dane7654,"Palampur, India",50

The lush green surrounding with the view of the snow peaked mountains on the shore of Nubra River makes this place a dream destination, one you can only imagine or see in movies.  If you are looking to get away from you busy hectic life and enjoy a serene environment, then Lchang Nang is the place. It is very quiet and peaceful and you can spend the entire day admiring the beauty around it. You are also in for a treat because the milky way is also visible from here at night.

ladakh,"The drive from leh to lchang nang is about 5 hrs via the daunting roads of Khardung la. A mere 120 kms taking that long duration is bound to make any traveller tired, and there is absolutely no respite when you reach this place. It is located in Sumur village, away from the main touristy hundur village. On reaching the place, you encounter the main gates which are to be opened by yourself. There is a guard room adjoining the gates without any guard ever present.  There is no room service for in room dining (only for tea/coffee at max), there is no tea and coffee maker in the rooms (as claimed to be on booking.com) and there is no TV in the rooms but there is a projector room in a common area, where you have to walk to every time from your cottage in case you want to watch",KHManager1,/Profile/KHManager1,"Jodhpur, India",10

The resort ground was very romantic and looked like a painting in every corner we turned to. There was a bonfire area with a bar for drinks. There were hammocks and outdoor tables and chairs to sit.  Each cabin has great view of the snow capped mountain. The cabin was roomy and spotlessly clean with sitting area for reading. The bed has an electric mattress. The bathroom was large.   What I loved the most was the resort ground and the garden. The food was not bad.  I had one minor complaint. On the first night, the food was a little too spicy for most of us.

The fresh produce from their green house was an added advantage.

On our return we rested a bit in the comfortable and well appointed rooms.  There was also a cute sit out area in the lawn outside.  In the early part of the evening we were take for a tour of the property where they grow a lot of things they use.  We also got to Seabuckthorn berries.

The food in the restaurant was alright, the buffet breakfast was good. They also provided us with packed lunch, for our outing one day.  The staff was always very cordial and helpful.  The two things that they can improve on, is that they should provide tea/ coffee maker in the rooms. The single beds that were given to us were too narrow and not very comfortable.

Actually there seemed to be no staff but for the manager who seemed to be doing everything from picking up the luggage to cooking breakfast .  I really cant understand how this place has got so many good reviews - maybe it was under a different management in the past .  Right now my advise would be to avoid this place entirely.

ladakh,Stayed at Lchang Nang for one night. Accommodation very good. My only quibble was no tea or coffee making facilities. I understand due to the solar power that a kettle may be too powerful for the circuit but a flask of hot water with tea or coffee available as we have experienced in other properties would have made it better. I still think it's a 5 * property which also benefits from an in house masseuse which was appreciated after a trip over the Khardung La pass! ,GMH2012,/Profile/GMH2012,"Cooksbridge, United Kingdom",50

ladakh,"It's a perfect place to go to for a few days if you wish to get away from it all! Its a postcard picture perfect place. Surrounded by Snow capped peaks and nestled in between lot of greenery, it seems like nestled in an oasis in the middle of the desert at 11,000 feet.   And the hosts Aditya and Gayatri were very sweet. Even though we were there only for a night, we completely enjoyed the experience of enjoying luxury in the middle of nowhere.",H S,/Profile/337hs,"Mumbai, India",50

ladakh,"We had a marvelous stay in Nubra Valley at the Lchang Nang Retreat.   The staff was extremely friendly, the restaurant very flexible (appreciate this!) and the restaurant chef, Chet deserves a special thanks.  The grilled chicken, freshly  baked mango tart were among the exquisite food, and the breakfast was nothing short of exceptional.   We were lucky to get a gorgeous twin cottage that opened straight out onto surely what was one of the best views in the valley.  In all, highly recommended if you are looking for excellent hospitality, great hosts (Thanks Gayatri and Aditya), and a memorable local experience in one of the most magical places.

ladakh,"This retreat has recently opened and we four (two couples) were the second set of Guests at the retreat. We had our bookings done well in advance but reached around Lunch time without any information. The chef cooked us a sumptous continental Lunch which was really mouth watering  They have 17 cottages and we were alloted Cottage number 3 and 4. Very clean cottages and excellent facilities. I have all praise for it.   As their motto is ""Close to Nature"" they chose not to have any light connections and generators and are solely dependent on Solar Energy. Round the clock hot water and electricity is available  They have their own garden from where you can pluck your own vegetables and give it to their chef who converts it into a scrumptous meal.   All in all hats of to these",Vijaikapoor,/Profile/Vijaikapoor,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"The place is extremely peaceful and filled with good energy and vibes! The landscapes and the surroundings are breathtaking. The food is delicious and healthy.

My friend and I had a great time and we had the best service one could possibly imagine! By far, one of my best memories of India! I definitely recommend it.",Saadia_2013,/Profile/Saadia_2013,"Ciudad Colon, Costa Rica",50
ladakh,"Me and my friends had the most pleasant stay in this resort last year August. The aptly titled ""Lchang Nang"" (we found out it means ""abode of trees"" in Ladakhi) was beautiful with all its trees and the vibrant flowers. We had the twin cottage, which is two adjoining cottages with a separating door. The rooms were delightful in their hues of blue and very comfortable. The food was excellent and the staff were very cordial and helpful. The best part of our stay was discovering the river bed during our walk in the wilderness that lay at the foot of the resort. I heartily recommend this place to anybody visiting Nubra. ",Priyanshi2015,/Profile/Priyanshi2015,"New Delhi, India",50
