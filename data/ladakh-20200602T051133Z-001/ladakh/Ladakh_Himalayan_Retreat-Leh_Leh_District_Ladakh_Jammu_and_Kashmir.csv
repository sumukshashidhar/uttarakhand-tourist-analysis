The hotel has a deal with various other hotels in Nubra Valley, Pangong, etc. and will provide a driver to go along with you to all your other tourist destinations. After booking this hotel, you may not need to work with any other tourism companies like Thomas cook or Flamingo, they will arrange all the places and staying facilities from their side. The other hotels in other places were also fantastic, we trusted them with that and we don't regret it.

A brand new property hardly 2 yr old, well maintained and having a peaceful surrounding. We travelled a lot to pangong, nubra, Hemis festival and what not and were provided with comfortable TATA Aria/ Innova whenever we asked for it at very reasonable price. Drivers were very well behaved and helpfull. Mr. Sonam Wangdu the owner is an extremely helpful man and will go out of his way to help you in any way possible.

ladakh,"My son and I stayed here for 4 days in mid June. We were very comfortable, but were particularly touched by the generosity of management following a biking accident. I broke my neck while cycling, and had to be repatriated by air ambulance to Delhi. Sonam and management were extremely helpful and supportive to my son who had to organise my repatriation from the LEY hospital. The manager provided my son with a driver for the day and even lent him his own cell phone, so he could communicate with our travel insurer in Australia and the air rescue provider. This generosity, in my experience, is unprecented. I've been immobile since the accident, and want to take this opportunity to sincerely thank management. I highly recommend staying here.",jeff031,/Profile/jeff031,"Sydney, Australia",50
ladakh,This hotel is one of the easiest choices that can be made. Following are the good things about the hotel. - Dedicated staff - the staff is so proactive that all over travel formalities were of concern to them and were handled gracefully. -Nice view from the room. -Nice food and staff was ready with breakfast even at 6 am as we had to leave early for pangong. -Owner Mr. Sonam Wangdus is a gentlemen. -We stayed at the hotel were 4 days and for 2 days even when we were not in the hotel - our belongings stayed in the room and not in cloak room . The staff knew our room priority so didn't allocate the room to anyone else.  Over all it is a very good hotel with a dedicated  and proactive staff.,ashish_sharma2012,/Profile/ashish_sharma2012,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50

I needed a taxi to the airport for an early flight and a driver was arranged and he even picked me up a few minutes early.  Clean modern building with friendly staff that's close to the market.

The staff is friendly and helpful; and because the hotel is relatively new the rooms and more importantly the bathrooms were spic and span with all things in order. The place also has a kitchen garden and a lot of the food comes from the vegetables grown by them. View from our room was great and there was ample sunlight too. The market is walking distance (800 meters or so), yet it is away from the hustle-bustle.

ladakh,"We visited Ladakh for ten days, this September. Ladakh is a surreal, mesmerising, and ethereal land, filled with varying terrain, friendly people and unbelievably blue skies. The flipside is that a trip to this area usually involves lots of travel on bumpy roads, and, inevitably, fatigue! For this reason, it is important to choose a hotel in Leh which is comfortable and homely - as Leh will be the base which you will keep returning to, to recuperate in between shorter trips. Ladakh Himalayan Retreat, for us, turned out to be just perfect!   It is a new property which just opened this season. The hotel is situated around a kilometer away from the market, built around a nice sunny garden with a gorgeous view of the mountains.

Not knowing what to expect of this place, except for the few reviews here on TA, I went with an open mind. And man I was blown.  Location: Fabulous location. Most good places in Ladakh are located within the city, leaving their places with little to look for in natural beauty.This place has a great view of the hills, few patches of green below that and a nice view of Shanti Stupa to the right.

ladakh,When you're on a holiday you want to get away with all the stress you've been through at work and want to relax. The Ladakh Himalaya Retreat gave us just that. Situated a km away from the market area this hotel gives you all that you need on a relaxing vacation. We were a group of 9 and stayed in this hotel for around a week. The owners and the entire staff were extremely hospitable. Whenever we called them for any kind of service it was quick and addressed to us within 2-3 mins. We saw other hotels in the vicinity but this hotel had very clean and neat rooms and bathrooms. 24/7 hot running water is what you need the most in a cold place like ladakh.

We 4 frnds decided the complete the whole circuit and took itinerary:  Delhi-Manali-Leh-Srinagar-Jammu-Delhi A delightful ride to Himalaya range ladakh valley and kashmir valley. A Must visit place before u die.  And if u r really adventurous then go with Royal Enfield or Bullet (above 200cc bikes) and complete the full circuit. This ride u will never evr forget in ur whole life. And if u r crazy with adventurous... then Reach Manali by Volvo (best service) and go by Bicycle to leh...
