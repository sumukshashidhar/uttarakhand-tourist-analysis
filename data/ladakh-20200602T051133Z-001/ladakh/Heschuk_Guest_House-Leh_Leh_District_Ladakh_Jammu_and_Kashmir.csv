ladakh,"Stay Dates September, 2017  If you want to stay in Leh and have a atmosphere like you are not far from your home. This is the place to stay. SPECIAL MENTION ""Ms Padma"". She was the best in terms of taking care of the guests. The rooms were really good with good amenities.  Location of the Guest House is not that great, but you dont regret a bit as it gives you that feel. The food was excellent. Every night they give you hot water, which was very satisfying. She took care of all those small things that matters the most.  There was a rule to take off your shoes outside the guest house. Which we adhered to and which i liked as well. Everyone was really good in helping us with anything we need in here.  You cant ask for more here at such a remote place.  One of the best stays i ever",Archit Agarwal,/Profile/superliciousarchit,"Jaipur, India",50
ladakh,We have no hesitation in recommending this guest house. Padma and her family are super hosts and take personal care to ensure a very comfortable stay. Rooms are clean as are the bed linen and towels. The food is freshly prepared with seasonal vegetables from their own garden and the simple menu is more than adequate to suit any palate. The family is well supported by courteous and attentive staff. We could also keep our luggage in the store room when we made short trips to Nubra and Pangong. They were very accomadative to break our stay on these days and provide rooms on our return.,sudarshan_pv,/Profile/sudarshan_pv,bengaluru,50
ladakh,"I stayed with my wife for 4 days. The rooms are nice and clean. The ones on the second floor had good views of the nearby mountains. A small terrace on the second floor provides a cozy corner for tea breaks and starlit sky in the night. The owners were very nice and friendly, especially, Ms. Padma, who can speak fluent Hindi and English. The food was freshly prepared and very hygienic and at a very reasonable price. The property has its own garden and fresh vegetables are used from this garden to cook the meals. The only drawback, it is a little further from the city, but then you have a much quieter place to relax. Definitely recommended.",Orion63,/Profile/Orion63,"Singapore, Singapore",50

ladakh,I had booked for two days and ended up staying a month thanks to the warmth and comfort Padma and her family extended. Super clean rooms and spectacular views. If your looking peace and serenity look no further :) ,Shraddha V,/Profile/shraddhav2015,,50
ladakh,"If you are going to stay in Leh you can definitely choose this guest house.  Big and super clean rooms with all you can need: clean blanket, sheets and towel; wifi 24/7, hot water, ecc.  The rooms have big windows and a splendid view of Leh landscape.  The owner (i think) is super helpful and speak a very good english.  Food and breakfast are also available and very good.  The olnly negative point is that is quite far from the city center (15 minutes walking) and it can be difficult to find it in the beginning.",Paol1,/Profile/Paol1,"Rescaldina, Italy",50
ladakh,"If you are looking for a quiet,clean,homely place with views then this is the place.We were 4 of us and were quiet impressed with the owners.Padma is extremely courteous and does not have ""No""in her dictionary I think.Food choice was limited as the cooks were on leave hence the menu choice was limited.However food served was homegrown and freshly cooked simple yet delicious food.I was with my elderly parents but few days we chose to walk to the market and we thoroughly enjoyed soaking up the local vibe.It took us 20 minutes .One of the days Padmas dad dropped us to the market on his way to work which was a kind gesture.We also enjoyed homegrown apples from their garden.One can sit on the balcony on 2nd floor and enjoy the views.I am definitely coming back to Heschuk if I ever",Rashmi R,/Profile/882rashmir,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"I stayed for a week at Heschuk house in early Oct'17. Padma and her folks were amazing guests. Even before I reached there, Padma helped me with arranging airport taxi, and welcomed us with hot tea and breakfast at her place. The house itself is situated just at the periphery of the main Leh market, so that everything is accessible while one also gets to stay just a stone's throw away from all the noise. The rooms were cozy and had everything you see in a typical hotel room. Just add good views and better service to that. Padma and her folks were constantly on the move to serve the people better. I'd been there with my parents. So, it required some extra care. Padma showed every bit of effort in making us comfortable.

ladakh,"As soon as we arrived in this beautiful guesthouse, we felt welcomed in a peaceful, lovely and clean environment. The owners are very kind. We would like to thank Pema for her kindness and her great availability. She did her best to be useful. That would be a real pleasure for us to go back to Heschuk guesthouse. And we cannot not to mention how delicious and generous the vegetarian meals are. Emmanuelle and Laurent",manuelol69007,/Profile/manuelol69007,"Lyon, France",50

ladakh,"This is a clean and friendly guest house, and what made it exceptionally nice for us was the excellent company in the common dining room.  The host is the owner's daughter, Padme, who comes home a few months over the summer to help her parents run the guest house.   She speaks excellent english and knows what travellers are looking for, including helping us book a driver and giving advice on the area.  The food is actually really good, although they take a while since everything (including momos) are made on the spot fresh.  The price was about right.  The only complaint we had was the 20 minute walk into main bazaar, but perhaps that distance made it quieter at night (no honking horns).  We were here with our family and felt safe and cared for here.  You can do a lot worse, or",Ian B,/Profile/I1679DLianb,,50

ladakh,"My husband booked accommodation at Heshuk Guest House for our short 6 day trip to Leh.  I was just a bit sceptical because our last experience at a guest house was disastrous!  However, Heshuk Guest House had me floored within the hour.  It's a compact 10 bedroom guest house with attached baths, on three levels- ground, first and second, run mainly by Padma and her mother but her brother and father chip in unhesitatingly wherever required.  Very helpful, kind and caring hosts.  We were given a very comfortably sized double room on the first floor which had huge picture view windows on two sides of the room with spectacular views.  The toilet was very clean and had continuous running hot and cold water. The bed was comfortable, spotlessly clean sheets, comforters and towels were",Darlene L,/Profile/DarleneL307,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"Since I was travelling solo, this place just made perfect sense for me. The mother-daughter duo run the place with great attention and make the guests feel at home in all possible ways. They also connected me with to the right kind of people with whom I could share the journey to places like Nubra Valley, Pangong Lake, etc. The food is so good and mostly according to guests preferences. Rooms are pretty spacious with basic amenities. The hospitality of the owners made a huge difference and made my trip a convenient one.",Shilpi Y,/Profile/shilpiy2014,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"What a pleasure to stay in a nice guest house after spending two days traveling! I was welcomed by a friendly host, my room was very nice and clean, with a beautiful mountain view. there is a roof terrace to indulge into watching the view, there is a little flower garden right outside. The host is extremely friendly and helpful with any info regarding local adventures. Finally, the food is fantastic! They cook so well, so many healthy dishes, mmm... I'm definitely coming back for more. On the negative side, there was a noisy construction going on during my stay, however I'm sure it will be over soon, leaving this place even more pretty and renovated!",Innafialka,/Profile/Innafialka,,50
ladakh,"Our stay in Heschuk was just great! Aunty and her doughter Padma helped us so much in having a comfortable stay. They helped us to organise our trip to participate in the teachings Dalai Lama and on another day they even drove us there. The food in her place is the most healthiest and delicious we had so far in India. Much better than in Restaurants. Make sure you ask Aunty what she is cooking tonight for her family so you get the best dinner ever! Try also the typical Ladakhi bred in the morning! It's homemade and super fresh.  Padma also helped us soo much and it was so cool, talking to her and get a little bit to know about the life in Ladakh. Altough we spend just 4 days in Leh, we have the feeling of get into the culture of Ladakhis. For both Aunty and Padma it was",snoop3004,/Profile/snoop3004,"Tel Aviv, Israel",50
ladakh,"The rooms were cozy, and had basic ammenities, no frills. The location is convenient wrt to the Leh market. The couple managing the place are very kind, aunty even served tasty home made food exactly on time. We had a good time sipping tea on the balcony while overlooking the Shanti Stupa and the Leh Palace.",Prabit,/Profile/prabitm,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,"We opted for Heschuk as 2 other guest houses we had booked initially cancelled at the last minute and boy were we glad. The entire place is run by the sweetest lady imaginable. Heschuk is less of a guest house and more of a home. Aunty prepares fresh hot home cooked meals consisting of dal chawal, sabzi, steamed momos, thukpas (tibetan noodle soup) and many more dishes. She even offers the food prepared to god before it is served to the guests. Small gestures like this set the place apart. The property has only 4 rooms, a beautiful garden and is very much a family run affair. Aunty's son is an absolute gentleman and on the first day he drove us around all through leh helping us rent bikes, negotiating prices and buying things we needed for our journey onward to Nubra Valley and",Sankalp P,/Profile/SankalpP31,,50
ladakh,"Stayed at Heschuk guest house for 3 nights in June 2016. Absolutely brilliant hosts, beautiful surroundings and top class rooms. Views from the rooms are stunning to say the least. Was made to feel a part of the family, which meant a lot for a solo traveller like me faraway from my own home. Wouldn't stay anywhere else whenever I am back in Leh.",neel24neo,/Profile/neel24neo,"Trivandrum, Kerala, India",50
