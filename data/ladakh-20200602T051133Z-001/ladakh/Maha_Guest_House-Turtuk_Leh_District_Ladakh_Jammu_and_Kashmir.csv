ladakh,"We stayed at Maha guest house in Turtuk. When we arrived, the owner MR. Suleman told us the history of Turtuk and guided us what all to explore in Turtuk. We exactly did the same and we loved it! The food of the guest house is simple and good. Aloo paranthas in the breakfast were really yummy.  The rooms were recently renovated and had wooden flooring. The rooms are small so is the village so we didn’t have any complains and we enjoyed our stay here. ",Ranjana,/Profile/ranj_patil,,50
ladakh,"I visited Turtuk earlier this month and stayed in Maha Guest House. Do not have any expectations In Turtuk, In spite of being cut off from the rest of the world, the people go out of their way to make you feel comfortable.  Maha Guest House, in Farool side of Turtuk, is a good 10 minute walk from the car pork. Please note that no vehicles can go beyond a point. You need to walk to get to any guest house in Turtuk.   This guest house is small and compact with an open dining area. This guest house provides basic amenities like a bed, hot water and basic meals. Rehman and Ishfaq, who run the place are very kind and helpful. Rehman volunteered to show us around Farool the day we arrived.  There is an organic garden. So the meals cooked here are fresh and decent.  And apricot trees",ridhi_ag,/Profile/ridhi_ag,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,Bad location. We had to trek for half km from car parking. Food and service were below average. Small house in village might be interesting to foreigners but not for us. Will not recommend it for families.  ,Vimal A,/Profile/919vimala,"Bengaluru, India",20
ladakh,"The Maha seemed to be the center of town for travelers, during our stay.  There was a steady stream of travelers from around the world, coming in at all hours (the building can be rather noisy) as well as eating and just plain hanging out in the inviting outdoor dining area.  The menu was just large enough for variety, and the cooking more than adequate. The management was very helpful in pointing out places of interest in this unusual town-- the Buddhist gompa, the chilly caves where food was once stored, tiny water-powered mills driven by the little water channels that cascade through the village.  We also learned a bit about the region's intriguing Balti culture.",Roger Y,/Profile/RogerY985,"Barto, PA",40
ladakh,"Went there on August, After a very long anf tiring ride - from Leh. Cost 900 Rupi to stay the night. Guest house seemed clean. The shower and the toilet are inside the room, but next to each other without a curtain. The rooms were in a good size for us. Hot water in the shower come from the solar power (sometimes the staff didbt turn the solar switch on - although we asked for), or electricity. Electricity will appear only during evening time.  The staff offered to give us a bucket of hot water for shower, but when we asked for it during the evening, they said the kitchen is now in work and they will supply it to us afterwords. Felt that the stuff are not being welcoming and sometimes rude (when my wife asked to turn on the solar switch for her shower - one of the staff members",Doleviko,/Profile/Doleviko,"Haifa, Israel",20
ladakh,Maha Guest house is situated amidst the wheat fields of Turtuk. It has an organic garden and the meals are prepared with farm fresh vegetables from the garden. The rooms have all the basic amenities and the view from the room is awsome,jkkartha,/Profile/jkkartha,"Kochi (Cochin), India",50
ladakh,"Visited this place in July 2017 with I AM ADVENTURE group and we were a group of bikers.  Nice cosy and clean rooms, clean toilets, clean beds and amazing food. Please do try their apricot juice, which is usually cooled in the running glacial water streams!!  Not to mention that the approach walk/climb to the guest house is pleasantly tiring.  Very hospitable and courteous staff and makes your stay even more pleasant. Special thanks to Niaz as he took time off to show us the local village, sightseeing and cultural exposure.  This place is laden with fruits trees right from Apricot, to cherries to berries, etc etc.  I plan to visit again family sometime in future.",Ashish Dugar,/Profile/ashishd131,"New Delhi, India",50

Mr Suleman, has put in lot of efforts to maintain this property and provide a memorable experience to each of his guest and this I can definitely say with my first hand experience with him....Mr Suleman and his entire staff including Mr Ajay have been extremely hospitable to us.   We a group of 18 had stayed in this property on 14th June 2017 and wanted to dance and bring in one of our friend's birthday. Without hesitating one bit, Mr Suleman let the generators run till 12.30 which usually is off by 11 just for us to enjoy the night.

ladakh,"Our stay at Maha Guest House,Turtuk was very good. We were a group of 18. We had a very pleasant stay there. The guest house is situated at a very nice location. The staff are very polite & always there to help. The guest house has all the basic amenities one needs during the stay. The food was also very nice. The owner of the Guest house Mr.Suleman was one of the best person we met. He shared with our group abt Turtuk & its culture. He even arranged a guide for our group to take us around Turtuk. Maha Guest House is the 1st guest house that came up in Turtuk. I would recommend to stay there when they visit Turtuk.",AdityaSharma06,/Profile/AdityaSharma06,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"We stayed here for one night. The guesthouse is still under renovation but Sulleman Bhai, who owns the place, readied a room for us on the second floor. The room is basic but sufficient. The bathrooms are clean, and the windows in the room are huge for better views and ventilation. He explained us the places to visit and got back to work. The location of the guest house is nice, its on one side of the bridge but not very far away from it. One advice is when you enter Turtuk by vehicle, you would notice a sign board of the guest house, it will lead to a steep climb, just ignore it and reach the bridge after which you could walk across the bridge to the left to reach the place. The sign board is misleading in some sense, though it takes you to the place, its too steep, just avoid",Arun DK,/Profile/dkarun,Hyderabad,50

ladakh,Nice hotel right in middle of the village. Had to walk for a short distance from the parking area.Rooms are clean and nice. Best room views are the ones facing Pakistan side. We had a good vegetarian food. They have a nice fruit garden. The owner was very nice and guided us well inside the village.

ladakh,"Rooms are quite small. Most of the staff are friendly. It has a garden restaurant attached which although is a nice place to sit, relax and eat, it is quite pricy. Given how remote Turtuk is one mustn't have great expectations. The Guest House has everything you'd need while not being too luxurious or comfortable.",ankitbhat92,/Profile/ankitbhat92,"Pune, India",30
ladakh,"Food : average. But vegetables were fresh. I guess it's their cooking Staff: helpful but slow and  have difficulty serving the right order so keep repeating and checking orders.  Accommodation: we paid 1200 for double rooms with attached baths on 1st floor + food cost extra. There was hot water served in buckets, no extra charge, available throughout the day. But we felt cheated when we heard from fellow travellers that they paid 500 for double rooms with shared bathroom and dinner and breakfast. He claimed from us 600 just for the room. So - BARGAIN!

On the Farool side is situated the Maha Guest house, a lovely place. The rooms are small but very clean. Food could be better but you are always eating farm fresh vegetables.  Salman Bhai was very hospitable and helpful. So were his helper boys, Ram, Manoj and Raju. I had a wonderful stay for 5 nights.

ladakh,"After Hunder, Turtuk is like a dream, a mirage. Slow paced, green fingered, happy people, all of them one with nature. After some searching we found Maha Guest House which was manned by Suliemanbhai (I somehow thought his name was Salman, thankfully not.) All decided on rates, he then wants you to tell you about Turtuk. Now that is so nice, you start off getting to know the history of a place, instead of just see the place for its beauty, you identify with Turtuk and its people. The rooms were nice in every which way. It was like we were sleeping at the foot of the mountains. Maha GH has a vantage point view of the very starry sky post 11 pm. The food was good too - he also arranged for some local Balti cuisine, which was nice. Need to meet: Hussein - a guy who will give you the",Jocelyn D,/Profile/JocelynD744,"New Delhi, India",50

Our trip planner, Mr. Vilayat Ali of Kargil Tourist Camp had planned our stay in Turtuk for a night at Maha Guest House owned by Sulaiman Bhai. Sulaimanbhai is a very caring and hospitable person and has maintained the property very well giving it a homely touch. It is surrounded by lush green fields and trees. The guest rooms are on the first floor and there is a nice dining area attached at the ground floor. The rooms, though small, are very clean and comfortable and have nice views.

And the place that welcomes you with its warmheartedness and quaint charm is MAHA Guesthouse.

ladakh,"Decided to stay at Maha guest house based on quality of stay, surroundings and of course rate after looking at a couple of options. We had booked two rooms on the 1st floor with attached toilets. The rooms were good enough, a bit small but neat and clean. Mr. Rehman, the owner, is a very soft spoken person. Vehicles can’t go beyond the bridge and one has to walk (and climb) a bit to reach the GH.   The food was good. Also the quantity of food was too much for us. For the breakfast, Mr. Rehman suggested to try local bread made of buckwheat along with a vegetable prepared in curd. It was pretty good.

ladakh,We stayed here for one night. Turtuk is a rather small village and there are only a few places to stay at. It doesn't get that cold here ( compared to places like Pangong) so you could camp. However we chose to stay at a guest house. There are two floors. The bottom floor has rooms which have shared bathrooms. The top Floor has 5 rooms that have attached bathrooms.   We stayed at the top floor and I recommend the first room on the left when you enter because this room has a fantastic view of the fields and the mountains.   The rooms are clean and well maintained. They have a solar powered water heater - the staff need to go to the rooftop to get hot water down to the rooms in buckets. There are only 2 people working there who double as cooks and room service staff.   The place,BhargaviSekar,/Profile/BhargaviSekar,Singapore,40

You need to walk up to the top of the village from the bus stop on the road below, cross the bridge into Turtuk Farol and walk along the main path for a few minutes to reach the guest house. Like in most guesthouses in the area there’s a cosy, homelike atmosphere. The rooms are clean and comfortable with excellent views of the surrounding mountains and fields. Hot water is available. There’s a pleasant garden outside the guesthouse where meals are served (or you can have them in your room if it’s too cold at night).
