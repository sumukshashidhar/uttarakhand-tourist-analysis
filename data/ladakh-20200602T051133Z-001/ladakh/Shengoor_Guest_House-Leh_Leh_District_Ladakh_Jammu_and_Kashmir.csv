ladakh,"This is a beautiful homestay and the owner is one of the warmest people I have come across. He did everything to make us comfortable. The omlette served at breakfast was the best omlette we've had! The room that we stayed in was large, had shelves, the bathrooms were clean. The view from the homestay is very beautiful!",Paromita D,/Profile/paromitad2017,,50
