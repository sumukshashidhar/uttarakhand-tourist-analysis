ladakh,I have stayed several times at this guest house and enjoyed many treks organised by the owner and I couldn’t ask for a better experience! The treks have delighted and inspired me way beyond expectations! And the comfort and quality of the accommodation could not be improved upon. It really feels like a home from home! I always look forward to the next visit!,Connector258779,/Profile/Connector258779,,50

An excellent human being, he made our experience very memorable!",kosha m,/Profile/kosham3,,50
