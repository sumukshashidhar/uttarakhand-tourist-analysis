ladakh,"Once you enter this place, you will find lots of flowers welcoming you.Everything seems to be assembled at right place.Ventilated rooms with an amazing view gave us positive vibes and very pure feel as if we have landed at a place which is very close to the nature.Kitchen garden was the second wonderful thing as it offers fresh fruits and vegetables to start our day.Clean bathrooms and toilets ensured that it offers hygiene .There was one different thing to experience 'Compost Toilet' which develops a habit to use it as you will find these kind of toilets majorly in Ladakh as they use it as manure for their fields.  Interiors of this home stay was amazing .Food offered was local food which was delicious and was served hot in their traditional crockery .Unlimited tea and local",astha_agarwal,/Profile/astha_agarwal,,50

ladakh,"A wonderful guesthouse. Best location, good transportations, no network issue, warm rooms, hot water, and a very comfortable stay!! I still miss the home cooked ladakhi food. Everyone treats you like family and are always there for your needs. Its not just the outside beauty of the Phyang Village..but this guest house has its own lovely ambience. Lots of love to Nyanjan family!!  I recommend it to all the travellers..who want to experience really good hospitality and an amazing experience of ladakhi culture and tasty delicious homecooked food.

ladakh,"I cannot say enough good things about my experience at the Nyanjan House Guest House. Sonam, Puntsok, Angmo, Rinchen, and Dol not only made me feel at home, they gave a wonderful life and energy to the guesthouse. The rooms are bright and have lovely cotton sheets. The food is delicious and made with love. Phyang is a fantastic village. I absolutely will be returning one day!! Thank you!",Caleb U,/Profile/211calebu,,50
ladakh,"Rinchen, his parents and sister, run this beautiful homestay in Phyang Valley - about 15 min away from Leh city. Plus: idyllic, sound of stream running by, beautiful scenery, spacious rooms, aesthetic, starry skies at night, very hospitable family, excellent feel of local culture thanks to the dining area and Ladakhi meals. Minus: Costs Rs 750 to go to Leh city one way if you need to. Slightly expensive since Leh homestays offer similar stays at lower prices.",Ila I,/Profile/Ilsie,Mumbai,50
ladakh,"Phyang was our first stop the morning after we reached Leh. Most people were surprised we were spending a night at Phyang as they said that 'there is nothing there to stay for'. It's all perspective I suppose. We loved Phyang, the views, the festival at the monastery and most of all this fabulous home with the warmest family that we were fortunate to stay at. The conversation, laughs, delicious meals and hugs is what I will always remember. Definitely plan to go back and stay at Nyanjen for a longer time.",Ratpacker,/Profile/Ratpacker,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,"This was my first visit to Ladakh and I am really happy to have gone straight to this farm stay that is managed by an adorable family that extends a very warm hospitality to all guests. The common place where everybody meets is the kitchen where tea and coffee are readily available any time of the day and the family serves delicious traditional dishes 3 times a day. As expected, the guest house is surrounded by a farm where one can admire not only the beautiful plants and flowers but also the surrounding mountains as well as the sound of the water flowing in the nearby stream. It is a serene atmosphere at night as the sleepy village goes to rest and one can admire the starry night. The nearby monastery located at a height is hardly 10 minutes walk from the guest house.

ladakh,Gary and I journeyed to Phyang to experience Ladakhi Family culture. We had planned for 5 days with Nyangen Family and remained for 10 because we enjoyed being there. We felt comfortable and were able to participate as much in daily life as we were willing.  The day hikes from the home are numerous and beautiful. The town people are very kind. Don't be surprised if you are invited in for butter tea!  It is interesting to experience the different energy levels of Leh and Phyang and I would recommend basing in this home and going to Leh or other areas when desired. This valley is very quiet as well.,ribo522,/Profile/ribo522,"Los Angeles, California",50
ladakh,"My husband and I stayed at Nyangen guest house the first week of July. From the moment we entered we were treated like family. A confortable roon, excellent breakfast and dinner, unlimited tea and a very cute dog Zawa!  Just outside of Leh it was a perfect spot to acclimatize to the high altitude and rest before a trek. Extremely peaceful and serene. I would recommend to anyone looking for a friendly, quiet home away from home.",tori5555,/Profile/tori5555,,50
ladakh,"We were a gang of three girls visiting leh in april end. Phyang was our first hault of the trip. We loved our stay here.... Nyanjen family was so warm to us. Hospitality was amazing... In evening we sat with them in kitchen while they prepared dinner discussing about ladakhi culture, food etc. The whole experience was amazing. Food, rooms n services were unquestionably good. They also have many pets who are very friendly... Specially their dog.  Its a cozy place with amazing view n away from the hustle of leh.... Specially recommend for first day in leh as due to altitude sicknesses you would want yo lay back and relax",Lavina S,/Profile/LavinaS29,,50
ladakh,"Much more than just a guest house, the Nyanjen Family Guest House warmly welcomes their guests like family. From the excellent freshly cooked local food served next to the kitchen to the large beds we had on the first floor, everything is the real Ladakh. There was a wonderful view of the nearby monastery from our room on the first floor. We were lucky enough to see the family and friends plough the front field with bullocks and a wooden plough as they sowed barley in the furrows.  Shared western bathrooms, filtered water available, Ladakhi earth toilet available. We only had hot water to wash our hair on request but I believe that solar heating is being installed. Please don't forget that every drop of water is precious! Beds have sheets and blankets, BYO towels.  Highly",Kim D,/Profile/361KimD,"Frankfurt, Germany",50
ladakh,"Volunteer ladakh and the Nyanjen Family is the best thing that has happened to me so far! Staying with them was so much fun. Sonam always treated me like her daughter I got scolded too sometimes :P I can never thank Kelly enough for giving me this opportunity! The food was amazing and so are views from the house. There are Apricots and cherry trees in the backyard. There is a stream that flows right in front of the house adding up to the beauty of the place. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone who is planning to stay at Phyang. It's extremely peaceful and you get to experience the Ladakhi culture first hand. Overall I had an amazing time. Hopefully I ll be back soon :D  I miss you guys so much :* (Aache, Aacho, Doll, Kelly, Rinchen)",Nush C,/Profile/NushC1,"Leh, India",50
ladakh,"This is a special place. Hidden under Phyang Monastery, I would recommend no other place to stay in Ladakh!  The Nyanjen family are the epitome of the Ladakhi spirit and culture. Immediately I felt this was my home away from home. I canâ€™t put into words how welcomed I felt. It was humbling.  The guesthouse and surrounding area is stunning with some beautiful walks at their doorstep.

ladakh,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Nyanjen Guest House. We loved the location,accommodation and hospitality of Naynjen Family Guest House. The guest house is within walking distance of Phyang monastery and is about 30 minutes drive from Leh airport.. Accommodation itself is spacious, comfortable with amazing views of the village and the monastery. We were touched by the kindness and hospitality of our host.  We loved the local food served with smile and throughly enjoyed the time spent in comfy and cosy ethnic dining area. We will definitely go back.",smishuk,/Profile/smishuk,"Kingston-upon-Hull, United Kingdom",50

ladakh,"This is an outstanding example of Ladakhi beauty and graciousness. We were made to feel special and right at home from the moment we arrived. My kids were delighted by the beautiful, clean rooms with lovely views and the brilliant flowers in the garden. Delicious lunch was served immediately. We mingled and laughed with other guests hearing their amazing stories and adventures. People are doing such amazing and inspiring things here. We then went for a gentle walk around the beautiful village. The kids were completely taken by it's peace and tranquility (not to mention Zowa the family dog). We returned home, relaxed and soon it was time for dinner. More stories and laughter over good food. We soon retired for the evening. But with a heavy heart as we had to leave the next day.",Anand S,/Profile/anands87,,50

ladakh,"We had the pleasure of staying with the Nyanjen family for almost three weeks in August of 2014. The authenticity and loving kindness of the family was the real highlight for me. They welcomed and treated us as honored guests. We enjoyed exploring the village, meeting some of the monks and monklets, learning how to make momos, and even helping a bit with the annual barley harvest. My wife and I spent 2014 on a round the world trip- this was easily one of the top five best places we stayed the entire year.",Connor W,/Profile/connorw702,"Asheville, North Carolina",50
ladakh,"I spent two weeks in Ladakh last summer (2015) at this Guest House as I was teaching at the Secmol campus nearby. It's been all the way through an amazingly sharing, discovering and humoristic hospitality in this house enlightened just as much by the smile and the intelligence of the heart of each member of the family as it is by the strong Ladakh sunshine. A place like no other one in Ladakh. Location, views and garden are breath taking and food is excellent. Wifi was being installed.",Colette C,/Profile/ColetteC964,Lambesc,50
ladakh,I recently stayed here with a friend ' we had the most amazing time! The family of Nyanjen guesthouse were so incredible welcoming & friendly.

ladakh,"My friend Rachel and I stayed at the Nyanjen Family guest house in September 2015.  We were greeted with a warm and friendly welcome and were made to feel part of the family.  We spent our time relaxing in the garden, teaching English to young monks at the monastery, hiking to castle ruins in the surrounding hillsides and walking through this delightfully pleasant and scenic valley.  The stars I saw at night from the house were amongst the best I have seen ever.  The views to the mountains stunning. The stay here became a highlight of our trip to India. It was simply so nice to stay put in such a welcoming family home!",lirvine_brown,/Profile/lirvine_brown,"Brisbane, Australia",40

The food is very good. the garden welcoming with flowers and barley; The views from the house to the Phyang monastery and the stock Kangri summit are amazing. Springs nearby the house and a lot of very nice walks to do all around, Phyang valley is the best place to stay, to share the ladakhi life and heritage.
