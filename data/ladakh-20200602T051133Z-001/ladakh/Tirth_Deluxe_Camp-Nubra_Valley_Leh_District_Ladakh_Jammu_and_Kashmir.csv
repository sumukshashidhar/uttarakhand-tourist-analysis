ladakh,"I cannot begin to explain how much I loved my stay here. Set amidst willow and poplar trees and lavender bushes I found this place to be heaven on earth.   I stayed in a tent for 2 nights. The tents are clean. The beds are neat, well made with crisp and fresh sheets. There is not attached wash room/bath in the tenets. There are common bathrooms/bath which are cleaned at regular intervals. There is hot water facility.   No charging point facility inside the tents. The charging point in the dining area of the property can be used. No wifi here. Only BSNL phones work here. Connectivity is not good.  There are cottages at the property too.   There is an organic garden at the property so the food is fresh. The service and hospitality of the people is top notch.   Loved my experience.",ridhi_ag,/Profile/ridhi_ag,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,"Nubra is a beautiful valley. Sitting outside your tent in a large chunk of private property with apricot trees around you is truly heavenly. And on top of that, nights are even more mesmerising with the largest size of the moon one can ever see. The Beds are super comfortable. Food is good and service is wonderful. Mr. Namgyal, the owner & the politician is a great host. Great stay. would want to go there again.",Harivansh L,/Profile/HarivanshL1,"Jammu, India",50
ladakh,"We stayed or 3 nights or so and it was such a beautiful spot to stay whilst we were winding down after our long days. The atmosphere was so surreal and loved the smells of the fresh herbs and flowers. The staff were such a delight the way they looked after us with our food and well being, also if there was any request. Really enjoyed it thanks heaps",Sandy W,/Profile/anjalil2014,,50
ladakh,"We really enjoyed our two nights at the Tirth Deluxe Camp. The location is just beautiful in the Nubra Valley, the tends are a little bit small, but space enough for two beds and room to put the bags. Each tend is provided with two chair so you can enjoy and relax the athmosphere. There are several common showers and baths and they are very clean. When we arrived we were greeted with tea and cookkies and the same thing the day after we came back from our excursiin to Hundra and Diskit. But what makes the whole stay unforgettable is the service which is really excellent and why not talking about the food: you would never excpect such good quality in a tended camp so far away from everything! Will never forget the soup and the bread, cooked by the women. We asked to have one more",Samax,/Profile/Samax,"Cant√π, Italy",50
ladakh,"We had 3 nights at Tirth Deluxe Camp to explore attractions of Nubra Valley. Most impressive was the served food and welcoming staff. They really care about their guests and keep the whole camp ground extraordinary clean. The common areas, like toilets and wash rooms, get wiped after each usage and the hot evening shower washes away the dust of the day. The tents could be a bit more spacious but they are clean and cozy with warm blankets. The garden is beautiful with lot of flowers and all vegetable comes fresh from the garden. At night time be prepared that electricity is limited and comes and goes so don't forget to take a torch with you. Crossing the attached barn you'll find a nice food path leading to an old Chorten. It's a good place to catch up with locals and watch them",Roman J,/Profile/romanj201,"Bangkok, Thailand",50
