ladakh,"The picture on the left is of Nezer Holiday Inn an inn by the same owner and not of the Nezer View Guest House. However, some pictures in the gallery are from the actual property. The Nezer View Guest House/Homestay is located near the old part of the city, far away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Rooms are brand new and big, and have all required amenities. The views from the windows are just breathtaking. People who need peaceful stay, this is the place you should go for. There are three floors, we stayed on the top floor, which has a small garden and garden swing. We shifted here from Spic n Span hotel, because of the noise problems. Their territory and house is clean. When we were there, internet didn't work, but the owner said it would work after some time. The",Swappy_kzn,/Profile/Swappy_kzn,"Mumbai, India",50
