ladakh,"I stayed at the Khamzang quite a few times over a period of 3 months. It is very clean with nice big rooms, attached bathrooms and free wifi. The owners are very helpful and made me feel very welcome. There is a garden with beautiful roses and other flowers and you can sit right in the middle of it and enjoy a cup of tea or read a book.",loltraveller2013,/Profile/loltraveller2013,"Penrith, Australia",50
