ladakh,"My stay at Shayner Guest house was pleasant, homely and very memorable.The location is nice and quiet. I had come to visit Let on my own and the first thing that i loved was that I was made to feel safe in a place that I had never known or been to before. It is very peaceful and has a beautiful view of the glacier and Shanti Stupa .The family at Shayner house made me feel at home everyday.They would make sure I am well and helped me in planning the rest of my Vacation in Leh. Mr Skalzang is a very kind and caring man who also runs the Guesthouse along with his wife .There are two people to always help out with things at the Guest house.They are very polite friendly helpful. While I was there I felt like I had been adopted into their family and was treated as one. Their food",Ranti D,/Profile/RantiD10,,50
ladakh,I stayed in shanyer house with my family for 2days..With the staff of only 2 boy's n a very rude owner who looks sweet but is a very cunning old man..Food has no choice as they only serve tasteless yellow dal n half cooked mixed vegetable which u cannot chew...When I asked them for some other menu the rude owner advised me to eat outside as he will only serve this horrible food...Above all he switched of the televisions electricity so v could not see the TV ...The market is 3 kilometers away from shanyer house n there is no shop nearby... shanyer house is a no no place  to stay in ..it's better to take a homestay as it's good to pay n eat wht u want rather than experiencing a rude n cunning environment with horrible food n nothing to do around...Bad bad bad shanyer house...,Yatin G,/Profile/YatinG38,,10
