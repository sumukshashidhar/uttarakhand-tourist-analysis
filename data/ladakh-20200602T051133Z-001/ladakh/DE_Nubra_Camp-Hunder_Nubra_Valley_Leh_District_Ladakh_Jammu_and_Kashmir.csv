ladakh,We had been to Hunder for 2 days. 25 Sep check in and 27 Sep checkout. On reaching the property we were told there was no reservation in our name. This is the last thing you want to hear after a tiring long journey from Leh to Hunder. The staff seemed to be utterly confused and not helpful. This is not a attitude that will have property survive for longer. Not recommended at all.,amarddave,/Profile/amarddave,"Mumbai, India",10
ladakh,"We selected this hut stay in the last minute based on the suggestion from our driver and ended up as the best stay in our Leh trip  Excellent location near the valley and has a good view of the mountains  Hut has all the basic amenities with a decent space and has a queen size bed and  couple of chairs and has an attached bathroom.Charging points are there with a light in bedroom and bathroom.Being a hut don't expect too much of amenities and luxury.You have zip to open the room and from room to bathroom also a screen with zip.You won't have power from 11pm to 5am  Food was good ,we had only dinner and that is complimentary and a mini version of buffet  Service was the outstanding part of the stay.Staff are always looking to help.They provide their mobile to make calls as only",TravellingLife_06,/Profile/TravellingLife_06,"Chennai, India",40
ladakh,Stayed there for one night. Insulated tents with neat and clean bathroom.Hot water available only in the morning times.located close to hunder sand dunes around a km and walking distance to cultural Ladakh dance show. Food was good and staff was helpful.Dont forget to zip the door flaps of the tent tightly otherwise would be noisy overnight due to strong winds.As its a closed space so no open view available.,Drvijita,/Profile/DrVijita,"Ludhiana, India",40
ladakh,We stayed in the place for one night. The stay was comfortable as the camp was good and well maintained. The staff were polite and humble in their service. The food was fine. You can expect the basic food only. There was no warm water in morning but that was fine us as the temperature was pleasant. Overall it was a good stay. ,Vivekhanand,/Profile/VivekhanandC3,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,The place is very close to the sand dunes and if you are interested in seeing the local folk dance it is right opposite the camp.  The tents are decent. Staff is courteous and helpful. The food served is decent. The only issue you may face if there has not been sun shine during the day as the electricity and hot water is entirely dependent on Solar system.  Good place...,pgargya,/Profile/pgargya,"Meerut, India",50
ladakh,"We stayed here for just 1 night. The views from this camp are amazing, especially at sunset. Their service is quick. This camp is very close to the sand dunes, that is the biggest advantage. Food was good.",Himani R,/Profile/himanirana107,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,This camp is very Close to Sand Dune and Camel safari point. The view of mountains from the camp is very beautiful.  My family had a very good camping experience ever in Nubra valley. Dinner has limited options but was tasty. This is the only camp in my entire trip who was providing hot water for showers in the morning. Staff were very jovial and I have seen them running around with buckets of hot water to help the guests with their morning chores. Overall a very place to stay whole in Nubra valley.,Raghu,/Profile/RaghuB93,,50
ladakh,"I stayed in this property on the 6th of May, 2019. It was a very peaceful and beautiful property. The view from the property was breath taking, its just 5 minutes away from the sand dunes. In the middle of nature , surrounded by Himalayas . The camps are complete taking care of all the basic necessities and the left overs are taken care by the helpful staff like hot water and other requests. There was no wifi which was perfect to connect to yourself and to the nature around you as you would initiate  a walk around the property which is green and fresh. The dinner is delicious and the camps are amazing . All in all we had a lovely time at DeNubra .",Kush7799,/Profile/Kush7799,"Doha, Qatar",40
