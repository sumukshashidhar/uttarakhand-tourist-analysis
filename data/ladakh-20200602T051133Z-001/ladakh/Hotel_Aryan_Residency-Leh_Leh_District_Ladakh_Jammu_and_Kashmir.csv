ladakh,Nous avions une chambre donnant sur l Indus : quel vacarme ces rapides ! Mais cela endort finalement et quelle magnifique vue sur les gorges  Hôtel impeccable et propre  Dîner également et très bon avec sans doute des légumes du potager  Le jardin est aussi fleuri ,Annie D,/Profile/annied586,"Rouen, France",50
ladakh,"Considering we were going to be staying at a non-touristy part of Ladakh, I was surprised at how nice Aryan Residency was. Our rooms were large, clean and the best part was they had a beautiful view of the mountains and Zanskar river. The owners were really warm and friendly as was the staff. The young fella in the kitchen cooked delicious meals for us. We were there for 2 nights and ate every meal at the hotel since there really wasn't anything else around. Electricity goes off at 9:30 pm after which you can sit by the large windows and watch a magnificent, starry show in the sky. Completely free!!",Ratpacker,/Profile/Ratpacker,"Bengaluru, India",50
