ladakh,"Spacious tent and comfy bed.  Unfortunately when we stayed the temperature was very cold and no heater which makes it somewhat miserable.  Hot water is only on in the morning for 1 hour.  Water is ice cold.  The resort is very near to Pangong Lake, within walking distance and dining room is facing the beautiful Pangong Lake.",Mama2010,/Profile/Mama2010,Indonesia,40
ladakh,"While we were booked for a couple of rooms at the mud-structured section of this hotel, we found the same to be muggy (and smelly) possibly because of the carpets and the windows hardly being opened. We asked if we could check their tents and opt for the same, which they graciously agreed (it helped that this was end of season so they had rather low occupancy). The tents were well structured. There is a small sit-out area inside the tent, and then a bedroom area with a large double bed, comfortable with mattress and double quilts. This additional portion of the tent did help to keep some of the wind away, and alongwith the bedding, kept the tent more insulated from the cold at night. Would still recommend some layers of warm clothing (gloves, ear muffs, etc) as additional",Sat_samp,/Profile/Sat_samp,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,Had visited the resort in june 18 with family. We opted for the tent which was spacious with good bed n bedding. The tent also had an attached western toilet. The food served was excellent.

ladakh,"we were 3 families with small kids. Were able to get 2 rooms and two camps. Rooms are preferred for kids as it will be too cold. Rooms are big, neat and clean.

ladakh,"This camp has a great view of the lake and is run by very helpful staff.  My tent had a big double bed, a standard and functioning toilet and sink in the bathroom, plus a shower of sorts. I thought this was pretty impressive for such a remote location.  The walk down to the lake is a couple of minutes and when I visited there were only 4 or 5 other people down at the same section as me. This was fantastic!  The food is basic (rice, dal, veg, paneer, chapatti), but is exactly what is needed and is decent quality. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner.  You get two duvets and a rug for the bed, but I would still recommend at least bringing a undershirt for the night. One negative for the bed was it was not quite as pristine as you would hope (quite a few hairs and not a fitted",Jake M,/Profile/jakem855,"Mumbai, India",40

ladakh,"Pangong resort has a mix of tents and built-up rooms about a 100 meters from the Pangong Lake..we stayed in the rooms.  Rooms are large and very basic. Given the remote location, they were more than adequate for the one night we stayed there.  We had to leave very early in the morning ( 5 am) for Chushul, the staff gave us solar powered lights to use early morning to get ready. They also gave us packed breakfast and served tea/coffee at 4.30 in the morning. Given that it was quite cold it was a very welcome effort on the part of the staff.  They serve dinner in the dining hall and very readily heat up a chapati or vegetable if requested; they are really very helpful and go out of their way to meet your needs.

ladakh,"We arrived late in the evening on a cold September evening, only to be informed that the rooms were sold out. It was a shocker because the tourist season was almost gone. Nevertheless, Lama ji gave us a self-contained tent, and we could stay overnight.  The food was average, but the people and the location more than made up for it.

ladakh,There is not a great variety to choose from in Pangong and we were recommended here by our tour organiser. They have two accommodation options - tented or room. We opted for the room because it was very cold when we visited. Rooms are very basic but the staff goes out of its way to ensure your comfort. Pangong can get very cold and their primary objective is to keep you as warm as possible. The food is basic but wholesome and never in short supply. The resort is about a 100 meters from the lakeshore and on an elevation so great views of the lake. Do stay up late to see the spectacular night sky. Pangong Resort is a decent place to stay for a night or two. ,mraquamarine,/Profile/mraquamarine,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"Pangong resort is definitely one of the best places I have stayed in. Location wise - It is near perfect. It is hardly 2 min walk from Pangong Tso. You can see the lake from your tents :) . There are some more tents which are closer to the lake but this one is good as well. Facilities - The tent is good. It keeps you warm at the night & the toilets are good & clean. Water & electricity will not be available for 24 hours because it is not easy to get water & electricity to this place. They will cut it off in the night.  Food - Breakfast, lunch & dinner is also available - buffet only.  You can get up in the morning to a beautiful sunrise :D  I would recommend this resort.",aashish_raina,/Profile/aashish_raina,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,During our trip to Leh we visited Pangong lake.  We reached Pangong lake around 4.30 or 5 in the evening. After checking out few hotels nearby we decided to stay at Pangong Resort camp. We chose the cemented cottage over tents as it was very cold out. The hotel is run by Lamas and provides neat and clean rooms with basic amenities . Our stay included dinner and next morningâ€™s breakfast too. We got it for a reasonable price.  The staffs are very helpful.Most of the hotels in these remote location run by Solar system . So after 10 pm they switch off the lights till next morning 6 . The dinner and breakfast were served in buffet style . Food was good with lots of variety.

ladakh,"Situated on the banks of the Pangong tso ( lake), this resort has rooms and tents. Spartan but clean and comfortable. Situated at a height of around 14,000 feet, nights tend be very cold and windy. There are no room heaters, but plenty of comforters and hot water bottles to make you warm....food is mostly Indian, tasty and simple. Before you retire at night, you are told to fill up the bucket with water. This to prevent the water in the pipes from freezing.  Hot water is available only in the mornings.

ladakh,"We arrived Pangong lake, about 150 kms from Leh by road, on 13th September 2015 by noon. The lake is truly amazing & beyond words which describes the splendid beauty of nature and an artist's dream of the whole lake view.  All the resorts here are mostly temporary & close down as winter approaches. The day we arrived it was sunny & windy as well. For people who come from plains & hot climates will feel a little strange as its warm as well as cold so it's best to remain layered & covered.   The resort is nothing fancy just tents & rooms with a decent view of the beautiful mountains. Though the lake isn't visible from the resort but it's a very short walk.  The camps however are way better than the rooms & I was impressed by the cozy interior & bathroom. What surprised me was that",Kanupriya_1981,/Profile/Kanupriya_1981,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,Pangong Resort is located not exactly on the lake shore but a little upwards. The walk down the slope to the lake would not be more than 2-3 minutes.   We were allotted a room during our stay at the Pangong Resort. Though initially we were a bit disappointed but we later felt that the rooms provided better protection from the cold weather and also an excellent view of the lake and its surroundings.  The room was big in size. The blankets were not very clean but were warm enough. The toilet though could have been more cleaner and better maintained.  The hotel provides electricity connection till 10 PM in the evening. Hot water was provided in a bucket in the morning.

The first one was a balcony with chairs, the second section was the room with clean beds, table, chairs, space for luggage storage, etc and the third section was the toilet/bathroom (the most amazing part!!) with a western toilet, wash basin and hot water (available only in the morning).  The stay in the tents can get veryyyy cold because of the cold winds in the region. However that's the fun of staying in tents!!

Only considered because of hard top concrete rooms rather than tents, in anticipation of extreme cold, but not worth the try.

Wonderful place to see shooting stars at night.  The approach road is very bad, and takes a good 20 minutes after passing the other main tents.

This place has a tie-up with J&K tourism and is located in Spangmik on the banks of Pangon Tso lake. In terms of the location and the rooms, I guess this is one of the best that you can get apart from the other tent resorts like Camp Water Mark etc. However, the service out here by the people is absolutely abysmal. Since we went there during off season, the place was empty. However, the staff refused to provide us a room initially. After pleading a bit, we were quoted a price which was shocking.
