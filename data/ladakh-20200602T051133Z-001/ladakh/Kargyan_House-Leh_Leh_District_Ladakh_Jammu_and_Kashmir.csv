ladakh,"· I've stayed with the familly for almost 4 weeks. Left all of my stuff there - before leaving for Markha Valley and Stok Kangri treks. Very clean & hospitable homestay. Dinner is just amazing & very cheap! Couple that runs the place are very friendly & helpful. Internet comes & goes, but that's normal in Ladakh. I would definitely stay again!   · It might be hard to find the entries for the first time. At the time I was there - a construction is happening outside. No laundry.",Deividas,,,50
