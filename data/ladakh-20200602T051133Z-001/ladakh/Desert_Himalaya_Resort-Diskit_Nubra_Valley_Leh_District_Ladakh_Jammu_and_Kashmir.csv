ladakh,"This is in an amazing location in the beguiling Nubra Valley. The tents we stayed in are well appointed, although with variable hot water. It was the end of the season, so the nights were cold. The Brandt guide does rather oversell the place – the food is very average and staff were surly (end of season probably). It was odd that you had to ask for your room to be serviced. The overall location is stunning but is marred by the noise from a very noisy generator in the evening and bizarrely the view from the tents is interrupted by a row of portacabins, which were probably the premium rooms. There’s a lot of competition being built nearby in Hunder and I felt this place needs to up its game.",Richard D,/Profile/Richard54,"Wiltshire, UK",40

ladakh,visited the place in May 2019. awesome place for family. you get a good view of the surrounding himalayas. You can also see the diskhit monastery from there. My suggestions: please carry sufficient warm cloths as the wind during evening is chilling. The resort provides electrical warm blankets and hot water during limited hours in the morning and evening. food is good and only veg is served. They city does not have many amenities. The service and location is exceptional.,madhab adhikari,/Profile/madhabadhikari,"Kolkata, India",50
ladakh,We were in Nubra valley at Desert Himalayan the first week of August. Location is nice with a wide garden and a good view of the valley. Tents nice but quite average.

ladakh,It is a very average camping site with very average facilities. Just not worth the money. You can find much better places to stay in Nubra for much lower price. We went here because it was recommended by Grand Dragon but it was way below our expectation. It is ok for 5000/night but not a penny more than that.,Deepa K,/Profile/Dkhitri,,10
ladakh,Fantastic stay ♥️ 2 nights camp stay was what MMT had offered at this hotel. No words to describe about the mountain view. It's mesmerising and waking up to this was a blessing. Food was veg buffet with lots of varieties. Loved the stay here ❤️,veenasaji,/Profile/veenasaji,"Chennai, India",50
ladakh,"We arrived at the place maybe a couple of weeks earlier than the season, thus the setup was still not complete. But nevertheless, the tents were comfortable and we did not have any problems. The dinner was not buffet type but made to suit the requirement of the 2-3 families who were staying at that time.  Also expected more night activities but due to only few families there were not much. The only musician that they had tried to entertain us and he was good on the Guitar. The surrounding is beautiful and you can see the Dikshit Monastery from the camp. Overall a nice stay.",Abhi :-),/Profile/Hi-Abhi,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,"Top three points: 1. Gaurav, the guitar player at dinner, was phenomenal. Seriously amazing. Stick around for his performance! 2. The service during dinner was great! 3. Judging by the comments I overheard there, people expect a lot from Desert Himalaya, but remember, it’s a campsite at the end of the day! So I was happy to have electricity and hot water (albeit for limited hours)!  Suggestions for improvement: 1. Quiet hours. Perhaps after 11pm, it could be suggested the guests lower their voices, as those of us in tents close to the main lodge or along the walkway suffer.

The tents are quite comfortable with electricity and running water, though warm water may not be always available. The tents are self-contained with all the amenities you need.

But the staff attitude is lax, reluctant, almost as if they are doing you a favour.

Sofas and tables kept out for you to relax on the lawn, overlooking the beautiful surroundings.  Moving around in the morning was an experience in itself. Scene of snow clad mountains around and the tall Buddha statue of the monastery to be seen the morning was quite an experience.  Food was good but not great. Scope for improvement.

I am kind of a trekker and thus I can live in tents but I didn't expect this luxury. Prices are a bit on the higher side considering the INR but it's worth it. In the remote village of Nubra when u have this luxury definately the cost will be high. At night you just see the clear sky and the constellations and milky way and I can't stop admiring the view or morning and night admist the mountains.

They have 3 categories of tents, the mid-version is ideal. Spacious bed, a smallish but decent bathroom, thick blankets (that are much needed), a cozy sitout and large expansive location surrounded by majestic peaks.  The bathroom flooring is quite interesting, something i had not seen earlier, will not say more and leave it for new visitors to discover.

The site is in a superb location but is dirty, untidy, has stagnant water (from which mosquitoes emerge) and is subject to external noise such as from barking dogs, a diesel generator from a nearby establishment and the local Iman calling the faithful to prayer an hour before sunrise.  The staff are helpful but management of the pickup/dropoff zone, late night revelry and site cleanliness needs addressing.

The manager also confessed once confronted and agreed to pay the entire refund .. we didn't have the guts to stay with kids and my old father.

Accomodation is really nice and food quality is good. the special highlight was live singing which was added charm to the evening.  A few things the property may like to consider:  Make sure badminton shuttles and table tennis balls are availalble, it was fully booked and these things dont cost much.  Add solar power to property, that can solve a lot of problems - e.g. Lchang Nang has done it and it works quite well there.  The new cottage bathroom is excellent but door knob needs to work and the shower panel needs electricity - minor things.

We headed for Turtuk first which is a must see spot and backtracked to the resort reaching somewhere around 1700hrs.

The nubra valley has lots of seabuckthorn growing wildly, and this berry is packed with antioxidants and other nutrition. So do try out this juice whenever you are in Ladakh, especially in Nubra.

There are Luxurious & deluxe, 2 types of tents. Both the Tents have self attached toilets. Check out the photos that I have uploaded.

ladakh,"The road to Hunder was under repair and the diversion took us past the Desert Himalaya Camp. We stopped to take a look and were wowed by the tents and decided to stay a day. Balbir Singh, showed us around the camp and explained the facilities. Tents look relatively new and are quite comfortable. The washrooms in the luxury tents were really cute. They provided lovely scented towels and citrus toiletries. Didnt expect luxury of this kind in the middle of nowhere. You even get hot water in the taps twice a day!!! The tents are set up on concrete platforms in a row. In the last week of May it was below 0 degrees at night but warm and comfortable under the blankets.  The staff was very helpful providing extra blankets and hot chai to keep us comfortable. The meals are served buffet",Vasantha G,/Profile/Vasanthag,Mumbai,40
ladakh,"Most memorable experience in my Ladakh trip was to stay in Desert Himalaya. Everything here was great, peaceful, relaxing and energizing. Food was very tasty.

ladakh,"This is one of the best places to have luxury tent stay experience. The tents and amenities are no less than four star hotel quality, and by considering you are getting these at such location just makes it five star experience. Cradled by the Himalayas you can witness the snow peaked mountains when you wake up. As tents are situated bit far from main village there is no full day electricity, but this is just add on to the tent and camping experience. The food is simply delicious and services is equally good and homely. The price is bit expensive but again the view, service, tranquility will do the trick, worth every penny",harshad k,/Profile/travelmaniac12,"Hong Kong, China",50
ladakh,"Have been to lot of tented accommodations over the world, but nothing beats this one. The best-in-class rooms will leave you with a feeling of awe and pleasant surprise. Whether it is the height of the tent, so that you can easily move around or the comfort of luxurious beds and furniture or the classy bathroom…  Everything here is made to perfection and add to it classic outdoor party areas, bonfire, adventure activities, great customized food, ever smiling and helpful staff, attention to minutest details…  What’s more, it’s in the heart of Nubra, Diskit. A perfect milieu of Ladakhi culture and nature’s own exquisite tailor-made beauty.     Worth mentioning is the full-moon that I happened to see when I was there. Swear to God, I have never ever seen such a bright moon in my",amit_a_desai,/Profile/amit_a_desai,"Ahmedabad, India",50
ladakh,"Have been to Nubra before, about 3 years ago.  Due to the very basic facilities there, spent just 1 night.  I was told about Desert Himalaya and on the trip to Ladhak this year (my 4th trip so far) decided to take a chance and stay there instead.  Had booked for just 1 night.  On arriving there, we were surprised to see the quality of tents and more importantly the HUGE open spaces around the tents.  Looking over us was this enourmous statue of the Diskit Gompa Buddha.  walked into the tents and we actually had an En-Squite bathroom, complete with a shower.  Probably the only time I have taken a picture of the Bathroom. with the facilities and the views and the amazingly friendly staff, we re-planned our trip and stayed 3 nights at Desert Himalaya. travellers to Ladhak MUST take",VenkatramanPrasad,/Profile/VenkatramanPrasad,"Pune, India",50

ladakh,"Leh memories everybody , but drive from leh to Nubra valley, crossing snow covered  Khardung La , then reach to Desert Himalaya touching the unknown beauty for the first time cannot be explained in words. Desert Himalya 360 degree huge mountain gives a sense of power, cannot forget morning tea with hot “Pakora”, swimming in stream of Indus River .Its looks so unreal that in a remote place like Nubra we had all the amenities of luxury .Starting from bed linen, quilt ,Rustic innovative toilet and always extra service given by the staff is unquestionable. Evening bonfire, and waiting for the moon to show in between the mountain  a price less experience .Simple but excellent food which reminds of home. Super polite staffs who becomes a part of the family and  feel sad when the day",arghyadied,/Profile/arghyadied,"New Delhi, India",50

ladakh,"After several days dusty travelling over high mountain passes, and finally Khardung La, the highest of them all, it was a real treat to arrive in the beautiful green Nubra valley and to stay in the immaculate accommodation of the Desert Himalaya Resort.  The tents are comfortable and well maintained and set in a surprisingly lush location.  Service was fine, though not very communicative.  The evening meal was excellent.  We would fully recommend the Desert Himalaya Resort",ceriandedmond,/Profile/ceriandedmond,"London, United Kingdom",50
