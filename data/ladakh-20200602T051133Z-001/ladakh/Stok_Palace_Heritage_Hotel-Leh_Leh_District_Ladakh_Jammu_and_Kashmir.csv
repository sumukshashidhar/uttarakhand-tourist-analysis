ladakh,"Stayed 2 nights in one of the heritage rooms in the palace itself. Great Breakfast every morning on the rampards. Rooms were nice, but traditional style. Good bathroom with all amenties. People should stay here for the timeless athmosphere",RikvbGent,/Profile/RikvbGent,"Ghent, Belgium",50
ladakh,"I satyed at both Chulli Bhag and the palace. My say was comfortable, the rooms beautiful aestheticallya nd comfortable. I had the best sleep ive had in a long time. The hotel premises and the room are taken care of with care and thought and any discomfort or need accomodated for . What i liked most was being able to feel a part of the property and yet being left alone to unwind. There is a lot of support and information avaible to making plans to travel in Ladakh. Highly recommended get away.",DHANALUXMI K,/Profile/dhanaluxmik,,50
ladakh,We enjoyed our stays at both the palace and Chully Bagh - both 2 gorgeous properties! The palace was a very authentic experience. The food was delicious and the staff very helpful! The best breakfast view!,Paola Z,/Profile/PaolaZ665,"Bali, Indonesia",50
ladakh,"We spent two nights in Chulli Bagh, which is an extension of Palace Heritage. The units were extremely comfortable, clean and are built in traditional design from inside. Wood and mud. The care taker, Mr. Aditya, is a happy chap, who is ready to help and has quite a knowledge of the Heritage.  His royal Highness, appears in person around the complex often. If you don't know him he may chat with you and walk away. Very down to earth. We had the privilege to dine with him twice, and meet him every day. The Palace is where His Highness resides with family and a few rooms are rented out to tourists. The food is very homely and staff is excellent. We thank you all for making our last two days in Leh very special. Take care all. ",Saisha K,/Profile/saishak2019,,50
ladakh,"Thank you so much for an unforgettable stay at this unique and magical place. I loved waking up every morning to the view of the sun rising over the mountains from my beautiful, regal bedroom, and we were so well looked after (and so well fed) by the wonderful team. Can't wait to come back again soon!",LCT,/Profile/LCT255,,50
ladakh,"The old Stok palace is situated just a few kilometers from Leh in the small village Stok. The palace is the dominating building on a hill over Stok village. The first impression might not be so inviting, but it is an authentic palace of the beginning of the 19th century. There are 5 (or 6 ?) suites, I now two of them, and I am enthusiastic. The historic character has well been kept, but nevertheless there are modern facilities available.  Furniture of the suites was appropriate and the room was decorated aesthetically. The highlight for me was the dining room, it is just splendid : just 6 or 7 tables along the sides of the room, you are looking on the gorgeous painted ceiling construction. Moreover I liked the meals served there. Service in Stok palace was excellent, all staff",Review314159,/Profile/Review314159,"Karlsruhe, Germany",50
ladakh,"We loved our stay in Stok Palace Chulli Bagh villa! The only thing we regretted was not able to spend more time! We returned from our trek in Ladakh to spend our last night in Stok Palace, a most special experience. The villa accommodation is very good, has all the comforts and has a lot of charm. The museum is impressive and the food is amazing. You can choose what you like to eat and it is freshly prepared. The home made noodles soup is divine and the Momos were amazing.  We had breakfast in Royal Dining room which was also a most wonderful experience. The views over the valley, especially at sunset, are enchanting. The staff is extremely friendly and helping to accommodate you at every occasion. We sincerely hope to return to enjoy a longer stay at this special location!

ladakh,"Location is a bit far from the main city of Leh but not too far. The views are stunning in the night time as you seen the shadows of the moon on the mountains. Rooms were clean and hot, make sure to get a fan. Climbing up can be a bit of challenge if you are a not used to the altitude. Food was great and made from scratch. Service is amazing as they would do what they can to help as much as possible. WIFI was nonexistent but you can use their hotspot. Overall a lovely place to stay",rishryan,/Profile/rishryan,"Singapore, null, Singapore",50
ladakh,"This is a property for people who want to visit Ladakh to better understand its proud royal heritage and history, experience first hand its deeply religious culture, and soak in the astounding natural beauty in an unhurried, eco-sensitive manner. Not for those who're there for the been-there-done-that experience.  This is part of the Namgyal dynasty's royal residence in and around the Stok principality, which is where the royal family moved to after the Dogra annexation, (before which they had ruled the land for close to a 1000 years). Therefore, you would be well served by visiting the musuem which has some priceless artefacts.  The good part of the location is its splendid isolation, far enough from the city, at the foot of the 20000 ft stok kangri peak, with a towering 22m",godot786,/Profile/godot786,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"We were a family with 2 kids and we resided in a 2-bedroom villa at the base of the Stok Palace (owned by the same royal family) named Chulli Bagh for 7 nights. Our overall experience was fabulous. The villas are done up very tastefully with a lot of space. The surrounding has been kept as natural as possible with Apricot, Walnut and Apple Trees surrounding the villas and some outdoor seating which includes a hammock. The food and hospitality was outstanding! They would prepare whatever meals we would like to eat - from Ladakhi, to Chinese, Continental or Indian. The preparations were really good. They took care of all our sightseeing arrangements, permits and transfers. A special thanks to His Excellency for hosting us in the palace ramparts for an outdoor bonfire dinner with",Dhiren K,/Profile/Dhiren1,"Los Angeles, California",50
ladakh,"This is a boutique upmarket hotel - quite literally a palace - but with only 6 rooms. There are 3 more villas on the grounds that can accommodate 8 people but our group of 9 stayed in the palace proper for a night taking 5 of the rooms, so it was almost like a private stay for us.  Each room is individually furnished in a unique but very local style. Very comfortable and quite modern especially as regards that most important aspect: plumbing and bathrooms. This is definitely for the active traveller both because of the altitude and that all the rooms are at different levels and there are no elevators (just a floor or a courtyard away, but it means exercise at that altitude).  Meals were served in the royal dining room in traditional Ladakhi style and dinner was Ladakhi cuisine",VivekH,/Profile/VivekH,"Mumbai, India",50
