ladakh,"If you love nature and you love peaceful places away form hustle bustle of crowded areas, you should definitely stay at Lassu residency. It's home away from home. Nice cosy rooms with home cooked food. Yurtung Bridge with water flowing beneath is a view to enjoy from your room. Do not be disturbed by the flow of water but enjoy it.",Sudhir K,/Profile/SudhirK578,,50

ladakh,"We went in a group of 5 to Leh in July 2018 and stayed at Lassu Residency in Leh. We had a comfortable stay - clean rooms, bathrooms, adequate hot water, extra beds at reasonable price. Sami, our host, has been crucial for making our trip hassle-free and comfortable. His tips on tackling AMS, itinerary sugestions, cab arrangement, restaurant suggestions - all over phone and in person have been top-notch and helped us enjoy our holiday. This is a home stay near Shanti stupa, barely 15 mins from airport. There is beautiful vegetable garden in front, a stream flows by the side of the house surrounded by the tallest and grandest mountains you would have ever seen.  Would recommend this place to everyone and will deifnitely stay here when I come again!  Thank you again Sami for",Tanya G,/Profile/314tanyag,,50
ladakh,"I use to come every year, for a minimum 1 month. They're like my family now. If you want a quiet place ( 15 min by walk to the center city of leh, through nice walk following water irrigation trail), and close from Shanti stupa for the sun set /rise. That is the place to be.

ladakh,"We had stayed at Lassu in 2014 and now we again stayed for 3 nights iin July 2018. Property is homestay and is situated at Yurtung Bridge, very near to market, 5 minutes drive from Shanti Stupa.  Their nice hospitality made us to stay back again.  Mr. Sam helped us to plan our Leh visit/travel itinerary. He is humble enough to check our comfort level about his property.  The property location is peaceful with adjacent river, homely kitchen garden and parking space for 3/4 vehicles.   They need to brush up their staff member 'Subhash' for customer service skills and make him to learn about serving b'fast professionally. This time his breakfast service was poor and he made every guest to wait for small small things.",Satish R B,/Profile/satishrb,"Panchkula, India",40
ladakh,We stayed at lassu for 3 days. It's a very good hotel. Rooms here are spacious. affordable..service here is quick and nice..staff is very polite & nice. Near to market..Shanti stupa place is nearby to visit.,Asmit P,/Profile/AsmitP4,,40
ladakh,This is not a place to go.. Worst attitude.. owner Mr. Samy think no end of himself. They will short change you once they have the payment. Also rooms are very small and ordinary. The wash Basin is broken. We were a group and had booked 4 rooms for 2 nights. Yet the service given was very poor. You have to keep asking evn for basic things like towels. The complimentary breakfast is practically non existent. On last day he refused to provide any vegetarian breakfast. ,Pareekshit Shah,/Profile/PareekS,"Pune, India",10
ladakh,"We were a group of 6 guys travelling together and had a fantastic time at Ladakh and at Lassu Residency. We met the nicest people around and the entire stay was quite comfy and personal in nature. Sami has always been in touch and has been very responsive to the requests and the queries. You will get a very homely atmosphere and will of course be made to feel at home. We got to meet Samiâ€™s family as well and they are very kind people. Subash is the man-Friday for the stay and is available for anything that you will need. Needless to say, 6 guys travelling together had a rowdiness quotient attached and at times we were loud ! ðŸ˜Š Sami never complained. In all, if you are looking for a pocket fiendly and homely atmosphere to stay at, this is the option for you. Wish Sami and",Soumik Ghosh,/Profile/SoumikG26,,50
ladakh,"The Lassu residency homestay is absolutely great, the hospitality, food, cleaniless everything exceeded our expection. I would like mention about Sami and his family, they were so caring and always saw to it that we got best of the services during our stay. Sami who owns the place is a very down to earth person friendly, he was looking after us as his own. Subash, the care taker was very proactive and courteous. Thanks Sami for making our stay memorable. Must appreciate the efforts taken you by ensuring availability of everything at ease. Rooms were well maintained, required amenities, neat clean and beautiful. Must say that you guys have set the bar high for your hospitality competitors to match. Thanks again and  would certainly want to go back again. ",musthafa a,/Profile/musthafaa23,"Chennai, India",50
ladakh,"I was there in August/September 2016 for a study trip. The Location is great, the price is nice and the best thing of this Residency is Sami, the owner. He seems to know everyone in Leh and helped me a lot to get contacts for my studies. He is very helpfull all the time and the personal is very kind. I enjoyed my stay there very much and can only recommend to stay there too.",Dominik B,/Profile/832dominikb,,50
ladakh,"This place is now a second home for me, if ever travelled to leh!! The people are very warm and friendly and very very caring.   The food is local home cooked food, just like your mom cooks at home.  This place is really amazing if you're looking home stays.  Location is absolutely ideal. Very calm and quiet place in the mountains few minutes away from market.",eat_travel_repeat,/Profile/eat_travel_life,,50
ladakh,I stayed for one night during my leh visit . The place was really peaceful and the landlord ( mr. Sammy )was quiet helpful . The rooms and washrooms were spacious and clean.

ladakh,"We landed in LEH  at the morning  the hotel driver picked us up from the airport to the Gesthouse. The owner received us very nicely and immediately  we went to a tour in the temples in LEH with the   taxi  that brought us. In general, we received good service. Even at the evening helped us coordinate tours and taxi to Manali. It is important to Ask For  the price in advance.  The room was pretty clean and we always had hot water. We had breakfast toast but I can not give food grade level. Far from the city center a good price compared to what you get",shidrugltd,/Profile/shidrugltd,"Giv'atayim, Israel",30
ladakh,"This is quite evident that this place sounds to be very economical by seeing the price tagged to it.   But getting such hospitality in such a price is just overwhelming. Sunny Ji has been an amazing host for us & helped us in every possible manner. He did guide us pertaining to the places all around and what challenges we might place if we were planning to visit those places.   He also did arrange a cab for us at a very economical price.   This is a typical homely environment & in case one is looking for the luxuries of hotel, the please do not go for it. We enjoyed it because we got to live in home & friendly environment. The place was well managed & the food was very good.  Five stars or this place. Best suited for people looking for solace & solitude in their stay.",apoorav s,/Profile/Samrinized,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
ladakh,We stayed here during our first trip to Ladakh in 2015 and were extremely lucky to have got to spend our time at the homestay.  The property is located in Yurtung village close to Shanti stupa and has a stream right besides it and is around 3-4kms from the main market.  Mr Sami was extremely helpful and arranged our cabs for the tour and managed camp bookings at Nubra and Pangong. They always asked what we wanted to eat before preparing our meals and their non veg food was delicious...though they can add a few options in their breakfast menu. Extremely memorable 4 days with the Lassu family at their house and highly recommended for anyone looking for comfortable rooms in the outskirts with tasty food on their travels to Leh.,travellingpantsdown,/Profile/travellingpantsdown,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"One of my friend recommended me that hotel, early morning our flight landed at leh and with out ant prior booking I called at hotel and they gave us a river side room. Room is spacious for 4 persons with a double bed and 2 mattress. Food quality is average they only had a servant that too was a girl so we picked our baggages ourself.  At day time when we are out from hotel we put our baggages at clock room (just out side the room) but they were safe there and owner didn't charge for that. If we got late some day they always call us and ask about our safety and give us some numbers of locals of that area.  One incident I like to mention which lend me writing that review is, at khardungla my accidentally broke my ankle a compound fracture and we were helpless out there, army doc.",AP9988,/Profile/AP9988,"Noida, India",40
ladakh,"We reached the Homestay in the evening. There was only one helping hand, that too a girl. We obviously couldn't let her pick the heavy bags, so we managed ourselves to the 1st floor. The welcome to the place was warm. We were given 2 rooms towards the river. The dinner was served at 8pm. None of us liked the taste as such. If we required anything we had to keep going up n down. Till now we managed and convinced ourselves tht it is Homestay. Next morning, initially no hot water in tap. Upon asking they infmd it will take a little time. Post an hour came warm water in the taps. Then after the first person took shower the drainage got blocked. We had to call upon them for getting it fixed. Initially she couldn't clear, rather the dirty water hit back n left the washrooms stinking.",Sagar K,/Profile/sagark590,,10

ladakh,"I stayed at Lassu with my 3 friends and driver during our visit to Leh in June month. Initially we booked for one night but we continued our stay with them only. Its a family run guest house, has 5 double bed rooms and one 4 bedded room on first floor. The family is nice, soft and takes v.good care of guests. They provide b'fast and makes you feel like staying with a local known family.  This property is near by Shanti Stupa and also 10 mnts. distance to main market.  I fully advice all travelers to try this once and feel the difference.",Satish R B,/Profile/satishrb,"Panchkula, India",40
ladakh,"Stayed at Lassu Residency with all male friends and it was a very comfortable stay. Hot water and reasonably good local cuisine was available. Location is very nice - not very far from the main market and still far enough from the crowd & noise. The small stream flowing nearby provides a lullaby to make you fall into deep slumber. Shanti Stupa is just a 15 min walk to the top. Lassu family is excellent at making you feel home and go that extra mile to meet your demands - even at such a meager budget.  The Family Kitchen-cum-Dining Room is a very nice, warm & cozy place where you can enjoy the local cuisine talking to the family about the History & Culture of Ladakh-Tibet area.

ladakh,"one of the best places that I have ever stayed at. It is simply amazing and the view from the terrace and the first floor rooms on the left hand side of the stairs is simply breathtaking. Rooms are very clean and more than that the family is simply amazing. You actually feel that you its your house and there are your family.  Any one decides to go to leh, Lassu residency is a must. The view of the mountains form the rooms and terrace and the valley of yellow flowers leave you astonished. The sound of the water stream which flows right adjacent to the guest house is breathtaking. We use to often go and chill next to the stream and have our drinks there. At night when you are on the terrace and you look up at the sky, you will actually ask your self as to why cant I stay here all",MalhotraG,/Profile/MalhotraG,Kolkata,50
ladakh,"Lassu Residency is an excellent place to stay right next to the stream and 10 minutes away from Shanti Stupa. Guests are being treated with an exceptional care and their wishes are accommodated to the highest degree of competence and hospitality by Lassu Family (With all smiles). Having stayed at Lassu residency for a week made me feel like a part of the family. The Tea and Thukpa they serve is the best of what I was served across LEH. Top quality service is provided and request for food to your specific taste is fixed for you on the spot.

ladakh,"Have stayed here for almost a week and it was just like staying with family. Its perfectly located, not far from the main market and still far enough from the hustle. Right next to flowing water, so probably the best places for fantastic sleep. And they will do everything to make you feel safe and comfortable. I was actually there when the cloud-burst happened. They entire Lassu family made sure all of us were safe and secure. They even gave us their personal car for the airport drop when no other Taxi service was available. Will never forget the experience and the help from the Lassu family. Will always stay here, whenever I come to Leh.

The residence is a ground + 1 Floor and the 1st floor having 5-6 rooms with attached toilets and a common dining hall for guests. The place gives you a true home feeling with its ambience, and warm hospitality of the Lassu Family. The terrace gives you good views of the town and surrounding fields and mountains.
