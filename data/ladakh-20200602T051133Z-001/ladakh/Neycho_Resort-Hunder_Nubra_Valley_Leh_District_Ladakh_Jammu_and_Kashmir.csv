It has quite big and spacious room with beautiful surroundings, lush green apple and apricot trees, every bit of  it was worth living.   The owner was so hospitable that we felt like home, other staff was very much cooperative. food was tasty. What else we need to enjoy our vacation.",Jitendra S,,"Jaipur, India",50

ladakh,"We recently spent 2 nights at Neycho Resort and we loved the property. It is spread over a large area with apple orchard, flower beds, and even a badminton court. In the morning, it is pleasant to sit in the lawn in front of the building. There are around 10-12 rooms. It was very cold in October (ground frost in the morning), and no room heating. But there was running hot water available twice a day. The staff and the owner, who also stayed there, were very cordial, well-behaved, and helpful. The place is a bit short-stuffed, but the low occupancy played in our favour.   Food was good. They also organize bonfires on extra payment.",Mitul S,,"Kolkata, India",40
ladakh,"We stayed here for a night while in Nubra Valley and found this to be much better than staying in a tent.  Pros 1. Property is new , there are 4-5 rooms in the property and the fittings were brand new. We got a family room as one of the rooms was not clean and this family room had 2 rooms . We got hot water directly to the bathrooms in the mornings. 2. There is a common kitchen where we had all our meals. The food was decent and staff catered to all of our requests with ease. 3. we had a born fire at night  ( chargeable)  4. The light only comes from 7 PM to 11 PM and they give you a small lantern which you  can keep in your room .  Thatâ€™s the time you would charge your mobile phones :) 5 . The place definitely has a view but unfortunately there are trees which kind of come in",Akshay T,,"New Delhi, India",40
