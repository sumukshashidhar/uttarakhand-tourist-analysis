ladakh,"We stayed at Panah, Nubra valley during our trip to Leh Ladakh in August 2019. Undoubtedly, it was the most pleasurable and entertaining experience for us. The rooms are well-done with a personal hamam bath which adds to the luxury. The owner, Ishu, paid personal attention to every little detail, planned the day ahead in advance immaculately and accompanied us throughout the trip along with his team of photographer and waiters with food and beverages handy. We couldn't ask for more! Must try if you are planning to stay anywhere around their place!",Neha,/Profile/Neha1985_G,,50
ladakh,"We will remember Panah as our second home in a dreamland with all facilities, very well made to order gulpings and super friendly people.  Stay at Panah resorts is reason enough to visit Leh Ladakh again and again and ...",ashok,/Profile/ashokggg,,50
ladakh,"This resort is situated in Hunder village in Nubra valley , it has villas unlike most of the camps here which have tents . Stay here was surely a memorable one . To make the resort sustainable no plastic has been used on the property, the villas are made from a mix of sand and mud , perfect blend of traditional and modern architecture which keeps them warm in winters . The best part I like about the resort was their reading nest aka library which was a machan under the apricot tree providing a calm and relaxing environment . The resort also has a upper machan which is perfect for candle light dinner and provides a scenic view of the valley . With bonfire and stargazing at night , I can say that the stay here was amazing . üòç‚ô•Ô∏è",Saarthak,/Profile/Saaaaarthakkkkkk,,50
ladakh,"Panah - The Earthen Retreat!  I remember this name because this has to one of the best stays in Hunder,  Nubra Valley! Located in the heart of Hunder,  this property stands out for it's charm and calm.   We went as a group of three friends and were greeted by the courteous staff.  From the east and comfortable check in to the delicious local breakfast,  everything was a relish.   The rooms are well maintained with one of the most comfortable beds I've slept on.  One can enjoy the scenic beauty of Hunder valley from their open air restaurant which totally lits up the atmosphere during the night time.    Overall it was a five star experience and the staff is super courteous and professional.  Would be visiting again soon!  Kudos!   ",Aditya S,/Profile/adityas3,,50
