ladakh,"I had a great stay with my friends at glacier view guest house at leh ladakh. The staff was very friendly and helpful, rooms are clean and had a great room service and the food served was delicious. The glacier view guest house is near to leh main market and it becomes very easy to explore the market",Rahil Khanday,/Profile/Khandayrahil07,,50

ladakh,"We stayed at Glacier View Guesthouse for about a week and we had an excellent time. The place is lovely (including the beautiful flower garden outside the building), clean and very welcoming.  But the best part about our stay was definitely the staff - all of them were extremely friendly, smiley and helpful right from the first moment, when they welcomed us with open hearts and delicious Kashmiri tea.  We are greatful to have stayed with Glacier View and highly recommend every traveler to do the same!  Noa and Abir",Friendly After Morning,/Profile/Abirhod,,50
ladakh,Unfortunately our stay wasn’nt so good.. We book the room via internet because it was our first night in Leh. The place is very nice and beautiful but we discover to have bed bugs the first night. They let us sleep in another room (very basical and dirty room) the first night and then they change us room for the second night. My boyfriend had 15 stings on arm and neck that makes him sick and he had to take cortisone.  We had to wash all the clothes and backpacks in Domza laundry!! After all of this they did’n make us even a rupies of discount.  So we changed guesthouse to another very close that was costing 1/3 of glacier view and it was much more cleaner and whitout bed bugs!,Simo,/Profile/HimoneH,,10

ladakh,Super comfortable stay at Glacier View Guest House! Rooms were incredibly clean with soft beds and ample space. Food served was very tasty. Location was perfect since you could walk to the main Leh marketplace which was just down the road. Staff service provided was wonderfully friendly and professional.

ladakh,"This guesthouse is located on Upper Turcha road which is very close to the main tourist strip and square within just a 6-8 minute walk. It's a great place to be so that you're not listening to the honking traffic and busy streets and enjoy the quietness of what Leh used to be. The rooms are very clean and spacious with lots of storage, great light in the rooms, the wifi works well, there is hot water and the family is very accomodating and let us leave our bags there for long stretches of time when we would be traveling around Ladakh. It was fully booked during high season quite often when we showed up so we suggest booking in advance. They even do your laundry for a small fee and offer a delicious breakfast if you request it in advance. Would recommend it.",Karen D,/Profile/H9181POkarend,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"The owner / host - is a very nice lady who cooks really good. Breakfast and dinner is provided here. Thinking back, we were probably horrible guests - up late most of the time, kept asking her for chai and hot water, and sick half the time. But she really accommodated to our selfish requests.  The room - we traveled early May and having not acclimatised to the weather, we found the first few nights quite cold despite the blanket. Generally, rooms are quite spacious and toilets are clean. When we came, the hot water usually runs for 1 - 1.5 pail before it stops. I recommend the upper floors for stargazing.  The location - we liked the location because it was near the organic apricot shop, where we frequently bought our supplies.

We were mostly roaming for the day and only slept at night so didn't faced much problem. But if you are going there for relaxing then maybe you will face a bit problem for getting food. A good place for stay (only).",dib2k9,/Profile/dib2k9,"Noida, India",40

Glacier View was so much better and cheaper, even though we had an en-suite rather than a shared bathroom. If we returned then we would stay here over Dorje.

The family who run the guest house is really friendly and helpful and provides an excellent service, always with a smile and a cup of hot tea ready. The room we had was really large and clean, had private bathroom and fantastic views of the Zanskar range to the south and Leh' palace to the east, and its cheap price was excellent compared with other guests houses we previously checked. Even when we had a flight cancellation when leaving Leh and we were going back and forth to the airport at 5 am in the morning for three days in a row (with all the inconveniences that means), our hosts continue offering us their help and service day by day.

ladakh,"We stayed at this hotel on our recent trip to Leh (June 2013). The place is really new, so the rooms were very neat and above average. Some of the rooms also had excellent views of snow capped peaks. The hotel also has a great sit out area.   The food was really bad with hardly any choice. The hotel didn't have a menu card as yet. The hotel has 3 floors but no lift & climbing in such altitudes, especially for guests who need to acclimatize for the first few days is extremely troublesome. However, in our case, the manager was kind enough to give us a room on the second floor after a lot of resistance from us. We literally had to tell him that we're moving to another hotel & only then did they offer something else. So overall, not a very pleasant experience.",arorareshma,/Profile/arorareshma,"Hyderabad, India",30

The house is a ten minute walk from the centre of the city, so it is very quiet and calm in comparaison to the center of Leh.  The rooms are very very clean and very very inexpensive for the quality (the price is less than half of the other guest houses and yet the services you receive here are way better!).  The view is directly on the Himalayan moutains, with a very large but shared balcony.  The owners of the house are extremely kind and friendly. They enthousiastically helped us with any advice we needed.  They have a WI-FI connection for 50 RPS an hour which is very fast, you can activate it on demand.

Its a family run Guest house and you don't expect families to be ""professional"" in their day to day conduct!  Having said that, the family which runs this guest house is a nice family and are pretty helpful when it comes to any kind of need that you may have. They anyways provide you with nice and spacious rooms with Clean Beds/Bedsheets/Blankets and Of Course Bathrooms !!. As a complimentry inclusion, they may provide you a cup of Tea in the Morning and evening. No More freebeeis other than that.

They kept my luggage and found rooms for me when I left Leh twice for short excursions.   Upper Tukcha road is a quiet road away from the hustle bustle, but a short walk to the main parts of town - I timed 10 minutes to the area of Fort Road I walked to most days. And found a shortcut on my last day so it's probably closer!  Bring a flashlight/ torch since the last short stretch of road is unlit at night.
