ladakh,"Pros: amazing location, comfy beds, views from upstairs room, cheap rates (300Rs per person), available breakfast and a strangely charming atmosphere as if it’s from an old Wes Anderson movie Cons: unkept shared bathrooms, no water refills",Jane,,,40
ladakh,"The best feature of this property is the fact that it is the only property right next to the monastery.  If you're interested in doing the morning ceremony, this place is super convenient.  If not, there are other ""nicer"" properties in the area, which are only a little further from the monastery.    The rooms are simple.  There are no TVs (if you're there to watch TV, you are making poor life decisions).  There are no bathrooms or showers in the rooms, you have to use a common space for that.   Though the rooms are not that great the views can be quite beautiful depending on the direction you're facing.    The restaurant in the hotel is decent, though not great.  Overall, I would recommend it if you're able to rough it a bit (like 5 out of 10 with 10 being living under twigs in",Rezanate,,"Los Angeles, California",30
ladakh,"The hotel is part of the adjacent monastery, although you wouldn't guess it from staying there.  We had a room towards the front of the building, affording a good view of the valley (and also the ceaseless comings and goings of travels, by van and Royal Enfield). The bathrooms are down the loud, echoing hallway, and aren't anything special.  My wife turned on a light switch and the patched-together wiring blew out, leaving a scorch mark on the wall. The management didn't address the problem.  The food, in the large dining room, was quite good and varied.  Suggested short hikes: head up the barren valley behind the hotel, past the monks' school.  Fantastically varied colors of rock and sand.  And, cross the main road and find your way to the river.  Follow it to the left, and",Roger Y,,"Barto, PA",40
ladakh,We just had food at the restaurant of this hotel. And the food was quite sumptuous & simple except for the porridge which was not what we usually know about porridge. The rooms have a great view to offer as it is right beside the Lamayuru Monastery. ,Pratiti,,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",30
ladakh,"Value for Money hotel. Clean beds, but had a common bath/ toilet. Parking space was limited and hard to find any other amenities near by but had a decent restaurant. Food was not that great though.   I wish they add rooms with attached bath. This hotel was earlier called as Monastery hotel.",Mahesh R,,"Bengaluru, India",30
ladakh,Hotel is just outside the monastery.  Awesome food . great service Tried veg food ( dal/paneer/plalin roti ) and found food to be excellent. There are very few places having good food on srinagar leh road. You can also get chilled beer here :) Can shop for books on leh / T shirts from this place.   We had a good time and awesome food here.,Vipul V,/Profile/644vipulv,"Faridabad, India",50
ladakh,"Great spot for lunch and relax for a bit with a bonus view of magnificent brown barren mountains. All the arrangements of the restaurant are done keeping in mind all kinds of travelers. You are able to buy knick-knacks and souvenirs. Very friendly and helpful people and serve good food and beverages. Could also be a descent option to spend a night in the long journey from Srinagar to Leh.  This is a basic hotel and basic amenities and rightfully so as the location of the hotel is so remote, everything you get here is a luxury. Very convenient if you wish to experience early morning or late night prayers at the monastery.   You want to choose this place for its location, pricing and atmosphere.",AmrutaG_13,/Profile/AmrutaG_13,"Düsseldorf, Germany",50
ladakh,"After finishing tour on Lamayuru monestary, we decided to have lunch and pleasent to see the hotel / restruant next door to this attraction.   Found they served all types of food, from indian, chinese, continetal, etc. Surprised to find BEER also.   Had a good lunch, which was excellant at this part of the world. The restuarant also had all types of sovienears posters, and other materials for tourist.   We chatted with owner, who told they had few rooms also where the rent was reasonable.   Nice to find all round availability hotel in this isolated place with good food. I recommend travelers  take a break here.",Sheshagiri Shenoy,/Profile/Sheshagirishenoy,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,We were a group of 6 travelling from Leh to Lamayuru. We booked Hotel Niranjana by calling them on phone and confirming our booking before we left from Bangalore. Mr. Tashi was very responsive on phone call and made sure that our booking was confirmed. The location is very advantageous for travellers visiting the Lamayuru monastery as this hotel is right next to the monastery. We could also attend the morning prayers at 5:00 AM happening in the monastery before we left from Lamayuru the next day. The rooms were clean and also hot water facility was available in the washrooms. Only disadvantage we felt was that there are common bathrooms for each floor. Our rooms were in the terrace. We had to go to the floor below to use the washrooms. We took those rooms mainly for the,ArchanaVaidyanathan,/Profile/ArchanaVaidyanathan,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,The hotel run by Mr. Tashi is a very good place for overnight stay. The food was good and the rooms were neat and clean. The hotel is located just next to monestry and on hill top. The bathrooms are not attached ones but very hygienic. Recommended.,SBGarg,/Profile/SBGarg,"Patiala, India",50
ladakh,"Only disadvantage is that it has no attached bath. Everything else, location and serve is very good. Management is very much willing to please. There is gyser, so what water is not a problem. In entire Lamayaru, electricity is available only from 7 pm to 11 pm,  and this hotel is no exception.",Suman123,/Profile/Suman123,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,After 8+ hours of Journey from Sonamarg we reached Lamayaru for our night stay. Initially we planned for night stay at Kargil.. but didnt like the place as it is very crowded so we drove to Lamayaru.. What a idea it was!! Its quiant place and really liked it on the 1st view itself.. The rooms are very basic and they dont have attached toilets.. but the location made us to compromise for everything else.. Its right next to the monastry. Staffs were very helpful..   Current is not available 24 hours.. Its available only from 7pm to 11pm.. So hot water will be available in early hours. If you plan to refresh yourself be early.  Neat stay for a night..,Chandrasekar,/Profile/srchandra,"Singapore, Singapore",40
ladakh,"Reached Lamayuru directly from Srinagar on Sep 30, 2014 and checked into Hotel Niranjan. One of the best place in town to stay if visiting with friends. Only downsides are common toilets on each floor and electricity timings (7pm to 11pm only). Owner is an awesome person retired from military and nice to talk with. Room pretty neat and clean with delicious food available as per requirement.",mohitbansal23,/Profile/mohitbansal23,gurgaon,50
ladakh,"Lamayuru is a magical place which emanates calmness and positive energy. On top of this we stayed in a very nice (basic, but nice) hotel right by the monastery which had an excellent restaurant (where we could finally get a beer as well) :) After a couple of days on the Shrinagar-Leh road, this place was heaven. Plus, when it got dark, there was absolutely no light pollution and we were able to get to the roof and enjoy the Ladakh sky at its prime. Absolutely loved it!  The hotel rooms are spacious and clean. So are the common facilities on each floor. The electricity does not work all the time, but the hotel staff informs you - so that you can charge your cameras (phones don't work in the entire area + it's still the area without internet).",KachkaUmich,/Profile/KachkaUmich,"Prague, Czech Republic",40
