ladakh,So I booked and confirmed my stay here in Hunder in the so called “off season”. Confirmation through Booking.com. Credit card details taken.   Now it is important to note that the literature and information on the web supports absolutely your choice to visit this place at this time of year.   Perhaps the locals need an update.  We drove for 8 hours. Over 5600m passes. In snow and ice to arrive at the pre arranged accomodation on dark. -15 degrees. Tired and looking forward to our room. I a single female and my Buddhist driver.   The proprietor was eventually found. Only to tell me arrogantly and uncaringly that they’re closed it’s off season.   I showed him my confirmed booking and said. So how come I haven’t been told this before now?   He didn’t care. Didn’t apologise.   Now I,NettybugA,/Profile/NettybugA,,10
ladakh,"We reached Hundar without any prior booking and looked through different staying options. Most of the properties at Hundar are tented accommodations or are basis concrete structures. Of all the places we checked out, Ldumra turned out to be the most value for money for night stay. The manager was a good and polite guy focussed on making the guests comfortable. The cook prepared food which tasted much better than what we expected. The place is 10 minutes away from sand-dunes if you drive. Also has a parking where our bikes rested for the night. The WiFi worked for a couple of hours and we were able to make Whatsapp calls which was a surprise. The place had Airtel network.  Also saw some construction for additional rooms here. Overall a good option to stay in Hundar. ",warrioraks,/Profile/warrioraks,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"Stayed for a Night in Ldumra Oasis in the month of Sept 2016. We had not made the advance booking. Booked the hotel only after reaching Hunder.The place is close to Sand Dunes ~2Kms. Its one of very few cemented accommodation in Hunder.  Most of the accommodations are camps/Tents. It has 7 rooms with good view from 2 rooms. Food was decent, not really great. The price is very reasonable. Overall decent stay for the price.",Girish N,/Profile/girish_nandibasappa,"Bengaluru, India",40
