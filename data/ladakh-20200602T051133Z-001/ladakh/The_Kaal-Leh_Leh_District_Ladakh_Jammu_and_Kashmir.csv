ladakh,"we visited leh in the month of september with my group to leh for a bike tour of leh , ladakh . we chose to stay at the kaal after getting positive reviews from online , and honestly it was a good choice . over all we stayed for 10 night days in leh , with 7 nights at leh , 1 night in nubra , pangong and Tsumuriri lake ( which was amazing BTW)  we contacted the hotel directly for our package and they arranged the wholesome stay with camps and royal enfield bikes . ( choose the Himalayan for leh ) . Travelling to Nubra / pangong / Tsomoriri can be very challenging at the passes due to the rough terrain and bad roads , but thats the whole point of doing a motor bike tour to leh .  you need to be patient on the curves and on the roads to leh as the scenic beauty can blow you away",kartiksingh,/Profile/kartiksingh1985,"Bangalore District, India",50
ladakh,"A family trip which was an unforgettable trip to leh . We booked our tour via Thomas cook as the Kaal is  partnered with them.  They planned a customized 6 night / 7 days and we had a great stay. The first night we were advised to stay in the hotel as we need to acclimatize to the altitude. We spent the day at hotels garden. The next 5 days we were hustling and bustling in and around leh to cover all the tourist places , the food at the hotel in leh, Nubra and Pangong had a good spread and they made sure we were served on the table as we were pure vegetarians. We thank the hotels for catering to our customized itineraries.  The experience has made us to visit again and we will be back to leh for another trip.  Hope fully soon :)",Bhavuk jain,/Profile/Bhavukjain5,,50
ladakh,"We stayed here for 4 nights and found the hotel to be a basic budget hotel. Since we booked better quality room, it was fine. However downside was there are no fans in rooms and at times it becomes suffocating due to lack of ventilation. Food in restaurant was basic, nothing great but bad part is unfriendly staff in restaurant. Other staff was ok. Room was large and bathroom was also fine. Cost of taxi to market was about Rs 300. There is a small lawn in the hotel which was fine. Hotel is also closer to Airport. Overall hotel is ok if you are on smaller budget.",Rajandani,/Profile/Rajandani,"Mumbai, India",30

I was suppose to stay for 4 nights but checked out after 2 nights and shifted to another hotel.The Deluxe Room was booked for me but on checking with hotel it was learnt that Hotel do not provide Tea Maker in Deluxe  Rooms. I got the room uograded to suite room by paying Rs 1000 extra per night. Family room is very big of course. The hotel is far from main market area and there is nothing nearby. Cab will cost 200 one way to go to city. While hotel is near to airport, cab will cost 250+ bucks for a 5 mins ride (may b 0.6 kms only) which is a blackmail.

ladakh,Its a great place to stay. Nice rooms. Service can be much better. People seem more lethargic here. Food is too low in quality compared to the stay the place offers. Nothing great in their buffet and the choice of dishes is so bad.  please improve on the food that is provided even if it is basic.  That apart the toiletries are never given unless asked for. They keep one or two of them which is just not enough.   Staff at the restaurant needs to be more smart while there are guests. We had the issue of getting water served and had to ask many times for the same.  All this apart overall a nice place to stay.,rads2k,/Profile/rads2k,"Chennai, India",40

I had the opportunity to stay at their suite as well as deluxe rooms. Suite was really welcoming with big washroom and walk in closet. Warm n cozy enough room to accomodate 10-12 persons in living area to have a great time with family n friends.

We had minor issues with our motorcycles but they were repaired as we entered the work shop. We rented the bikes for five days n they reached their destinations every day.

It would have been more comfortable at night if the hotel management had turned on the heaters at night in the guest rooms since it was quite cold - definitely 2-3 deg C. There are no lifts since it is a two storied building; hence it a bit difficult for those senior citizens who were allotted the upper rooms. The food was basic and repetitive nothing fancy.  However, it is understood that food is not a strong point at any of the hotels in this region. The staff was pleasant, helpful and cooperative.

Hotels rooms of new wing are big and spacious but has a very poor maintenance. Housekeeping staff is very good.

The proximity to the airport makes it a good choice though its away from the city center; The exteriors of Kaal are faboulous, it overlooks the mountains, has a garden patch.   The rooms are spacious with a balcony, but a lot to be desired. With current climate change, it gets very uncomfortable with no fans in the room and it feels claustrophobic in the nights during summer. Rooms are very dusty and needs a serious spring cleaning.   The bathrooms are very basic and plumbing needs a major overhaul.

I would specially like to comment on the services that we were provided with. The food was excellent- be it breakfast or dinner. The in room dining and services were at par with five star hotels. Since there was no network reception, the staff provided us with spare SIM cards (of course, not for free), which was extremely helpful in connecting with our kids and family.

For example, room heating was out of order for the last three days, And there was no prior notice, no apology, no concern whatsoever!

ladakh,"Hotel Kaal is a nice property in the quite surroundings of Leh. We were a group of four who stayed in Kaal for 5 nights. It was a pleasant surprise to find delicious food there and the everyday menu was tastefully decided. The staff is very helpful and did their bit to fulfill all our needs. Most of the properties in Leh have a solar water heater so was this one, if you need hot water very early in the morning do not hesitate to ask the boys there and they can lit up the boiler in the midnight to provide you with hot water.",Abhi5684,/Profile/Abhi5684,"Jaipur, India",40
ladakh,"I will divide my review about this hotel into pros and cons. Pros: - Highly responsive staff. - Comfortable, spacious and clean rooms. Bathrooms are clean and spacious too. - Close to the airport so less hustle bustle as the market is a bit far (around 2.5-3        kms) - Great lawn with bright flowers in full bloom.  Cons:  - No lift. At that altitude it really takes lot of energy to climb till the last floor. -The food is good but spicy. It can be better. Can include some local cuisines as    well.  - When you say free wi-fi, it should work in the rooms as well. - Not so near to the market. Its a 20 min walk to the market but at that altitude again       it surely leaves you breathless enough. :)",Ipshita B,/Profile/ipshitab2017,"New Delhi, India",40

Room was spacious, very clean, bed was comfortable and from the roof top there is a beautiful view of leh.   On arrival at the hotel, we received very warm welcome and  good advice at the hotel, about acclimation on first day. Mr.Stanzin and hotel staff really took good care of us.

The room (302) was modest, but backed on to the kitchen flu, and every afternoon and evening our room filled with the smell of smoke. We had half a bed sheet to share between us and dared not walk barefoot on the disgusting carpet. The staff were extremely non-communicative and tended to stare at me. The hotel is handy to the airport, but a long walk into the town centre if you plan to eat anything different to the bland buffet they offer.  After a couple of days we moved to a guesthouse, clean & smell free, with friendly staff and closer to the centre of town. The best decision we made in Leh was leaving this hotel.",Alexandra G,/Profile/alexandrag135,Au,10

There was only one half sheet for the two us to share on our pushed together single beds. The bedding is also worn. The room smells of fungus. The bathroom was also very fungal on the ceiling.  After our trip to the Nubra Valley, we were transferred to a suite. While spacious, it lacks air circulation.

There is nothing much to do in this hotel.

The advantage of this hotel is that it is away from the hustle bustle of the Leh market but that is also a disadvantage.

There is construction going on at the property but it proved to be very minor inconvenience. One could easily walk to the market center or take a taxi for 200 rupee. There were frequent power failures but it was not the fault of the hotel, it was the main power  grid. At night the gates are closed and vehicles secure. I have no experience staying in other Leh hotels to compare Hotel Kaal against but my opinion is that it is one of the better hotels in Leh.

The food spread for lunch and dinner was quite good given the location.  However a lot needs to be worked upon bfast as it was repetitive for 5 days with variety in only one dish. Staff is helpful and pleasant. Also they did not let us put a bonfire and that was a let down.

ladakh,"What really makes this hotel standout is its warmth. The view is awesome, the rooms are spacious and clean. The food is average, but well made. Overall, this is perhaps the ideal place you can stay at in Leh.",gneil99,/Profile/gneil99,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,"I had a lifetime experience in LEH. I stayed at this hotel, the staff is very good. Even the food provided is awesome. My father had a good chat with the owner of hotel and she told him about how they take efforts to provide the hot water to customers, which is a necessity in Leh. The only disadvantage is that it is far from market but somehow i found it blessing in disguise. Because Market is full of smell of diesel.",ragarg10,/Profile/ragarg10,,40
ladakh,"Excellent Hotel, awesome hospitality....  The staff is courteous the owners are so good  Sonamji is an excellent host keeps in mind the taste of the guests present and gets food prepared accordingly... She also guided us what to buy  where to shop.... It was a worthwhile experience to stay at Kaal  If we ever visit leh-ladakh again Kaal will be the place to stay.... As for electricity as mentioned in a few reviews its a problem in ladak and the hotel cannot be blamed for it, I think the government should take steps in that regard... But, it does not matter as it is a beautiful place to visit, a must have experience...",ShubraGupta,/Profile/ShubraGupta,"Gurgaon, Haryana, India",50
ladakh,"average hotel - all services provided can be rated average at best! the staff is courteous (like most of ladakhis) and has good intentions, but unfortunately their actions do not match their intentions. It took me 2 days (in a 3 day stay) and 5-6 discussions with the hotel manager to get the TV/satellite reception in my room to get working, ditto for telephone in room.  Food was specially bad, catering mostly to the gujju tourist crowd. As a tourist when I travel, i like to taste some local cuisine and in this hotel, they did not even seem to have momos in any of their set meals. breakfast was pathetic too but i survived on omlettes which they were kind enough to custom make for me.  My advise for fellow travellers would be to avoid this hotel and look for others in the middle",VivekB67,/Profile/VivekB67,"Mumbai, India",20
ladakh,"If you are looking for a good location in Leh, then you could look at Kaal. Far from the hustle-bustle of the town, this offers living in serene environment. View from the rooms is also great - you can see snow-clad mountains & the airport.",srini05,/Profile/srini05,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"It has nice wood architect ,good food because we were only two of us staying there, taken closed care, first night was a nightmare with screaming  dogs. hotel is too far from the town, every taxi ride cost me 100$rupee .",hoesmither,/Profile/hoesmither,london,20
ladakh,A pretty and very pleasant hotel. The Kaal had plenty of charm and a staff that could not do enough for you. Beer was difficult to find in Leh but armed with a few rupees one of the waiters raced off on his bike and came back 1/2 an hour later weighed down with bottles.The food was excellent and everything was spotlessly clean. The hotel was nearly empty which was a shame for them. Its probably a 2 star hotel and very good value at that.,Steggs,/Profile/Steggs,england,40
ladakh,"We were booked into this hotel by our Delhi based travel agent and stayed 4 nights. The hotel is very attractive and features a lot of traditional carved wood. Our room was furnished in a very basic style, but was spacious, clean and had a private back balcony as well as a front balcony. The bathroom had a shower but no tub, with modern fixtures. There was no phone in the room, but there was a TV. The staff were extremely pleasant/helpful and the food was delicious. They even brought our dinner up to us on a tray when we returned after the dinner buffet had closed!   The hotel is just a short taxi ride from the center of Leh, and the going rate at the time was 100 rupees.",CA_expat,/Profile/CA_expat,"London, United Kingdom",40
