ladakh,"Unfortunately I was only able to spend two days at the Indus River Camp but my experience there was absolutely incredible. Never have I ever had nicer, more helpful hosts. The food is out of this world and makes you not want to breakfast, lunch or dine anywhere else. Hearing the river flow at night and watching the sun rise above the mountains just opposite of your cottage/tent - those are experiences that you can’t put a pricetag on. Thank you Nico & Mary!

The structures have had a complete upgrade.   The dining area has also been upgraded, and moved to a more central location. The new and improved dining room has separate tables for guests and there is always a table waiting for your party size. There is also a nice chilling area with soft seating for relaxing and reading with mountain views opposite a massive hand painted wall mural which depicts the region, it was being completed whilst we were there.

Thank you so much for your support!  The place is beautiful, cottages are very well built and the views are amazing. But it was hard to find this place as there are no Sign Boards on the way and you have to understand the vague directions given by Nico to reach here.   The Biggest problematic thing here is the FOOD.  They have a set menu for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner and there is no option for Ala-carte. You will have to eat what they serve which will cost you around ~INR 3500 per couple per day (for all the 3 meals).

It is atleast 30-40 mins by car to the town of Leh - so arrange for transport accordingly if you want to explore Leh itself. Tents were cosy with adequate facilities and the staff was courteous and prompt . Nico had some pretty good suggestions on what to do in Ladakh .

We were served great home cooked food, some of the best food we had on the whole trip and we saved much money drinking the free filtered water provided.   The campsite is on beautiful land, a green carpet surrounded by jagged snow capped mountains with the Indus storming by. We arrived for two night but already knew we would be there at least 4.  In the day we would chill, find the",Ruben H,/Profile/164rubenh,,50

They give you bonfire on the first day of the stay. Good food and the staff takes very good care of the guests. Loved it ",dipti7,/Profile/dipti7,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Amidst lush green vegetation with mountains on one side and Indus river on the other side, your mind naturally finds peace in Luna Eco Camp! It's an amazing place for early morning walk, lazying around in afternoon, chai (Tea) near riverside in the evening and gazing at stars with bonfire before retiring for the night. Clean tents with attached bathroom, hot water, in house dining facility (Bollywood music in background complementary :P) and friendly staffs. Soon Luna team are putting up outdoor games facility, mini library for book lovers and loads more to enhance the experience of stay, so those planning to visit in near future will get to have more fun and lively experience.  Loved the place, food and behaviour of staffs. In a nutshell brilliant place to chill and relax.",Srumita N,/Profile/SrumitaN,,50
ladakh,"We were a group of 8 people (3M, 5F) visiting Leh for a week. We booked the camps online and just loved this place!  The camps are away from the hustle of the city and have river side camps. The place is peaceful and lush green. The camp manager, Nico, is gen of a person. He helped us in almost everything- from getting cabs to the city, to fixing us up with travel agents to get cabs for Nubra, Pangong and Manali. If you have any problem, Nico can help you solve it and get you anything you want in the camps (booze, food, etc).   River Indus is just next to the camps and you can spend your evenings river side. Sitting next to the river and having tea and snacks was really amazing!  The camps have inhouse cooking area were the staff made us breakfast and dinner. Breakfast was",Aayush16,/Profile/Aayush16,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
ladakh,"The property is undoubtedly very nice. Big area, nice swiss tents with attached bathrooms. River flowing near by the camps, huge area for parties and bonfire. The place is great for stay though it is around 7kms from bus stand and market.  Bad part is the service which needs vast improvement. Food department also needs a check immediately. On our 3 nights stay, we slept literally hungry as we didn't like the quality and taste of the food. Apart from these cons, property is great with awesome Views. Hope service and food is improved the next time we visit.",2312harsh,/Profile/2312harsh,"New Delhi, India",40

ladakh,"The best way to approach Luna Eco Camp is by raft. After a leisurely morning float on the Indus you land at Choglamsar just in time for lunch, and the day is perfect.  Upon entering the sprawling camp site, you first notice the lovely landscaping and beautiful walkways that lead you from one secluded area to another. The landscape and the views are simply stunning from this vantage point, and the amenities are a perfect match. There are tents for every budget, from simple A-shapes to what resembles little country homes with attached bathrooms, lovingly and tastefully furnished with locally sourced materials. There is light as well as outlets to charge your phone and camera.   A little further down the path is a beautiful swimming pond with a terrace and a small jetty, all left",Antje K,/Profile/792antjek,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",50
ladakh,"Staff is extremely friendly and the place is just perfect, the river flows through the camp which is a great sight in itself. They have all sorts of games for kids, archery and indoor games which keep the kids busy. they have a small pond with a wooden bridge over it which is a great place to get photos clicked. the only trade off is the proximity to city but the distance is easily covered in 15 minutes. The best part was the stars that we got to see in the night as the place is away from the city. an ideal place for groups",Siddharth J,/Profile/siddharthj200,"Rajkot, India",50
ladakh,"This is a fantastic property. Mr. Skarma is a gracious host and he did everything to take care of us like his own family.   The property is huge, the people are extremely friendly. If you want to enjoy the true mother nature then this is the place where you arw supposed to be!  The tents are spacious and clean. They were extremely lavish. The service was prompt and the food was great too.   Looking forward to revisiting the memories sooner.   Thank you so much for such a wonderful experience.",Ameya P,/Profile/421ameyap,,50
