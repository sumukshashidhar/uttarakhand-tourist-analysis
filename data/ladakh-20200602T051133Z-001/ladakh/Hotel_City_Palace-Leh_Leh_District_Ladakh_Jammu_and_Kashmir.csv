At arrival one of my fellow travelers took the help offered by one of the staff to carry the luggage upstairs, since he hasn't had any small money to give the tip immediately, he told the guy he would get some change and pay him a bit later. But the guy simply would not leave without getting any money.   The night was more or less uneventful apart from a power switch off at 11pm.
