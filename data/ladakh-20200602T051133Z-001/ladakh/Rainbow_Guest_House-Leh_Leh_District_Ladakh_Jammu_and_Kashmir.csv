One of our friend have referred this place so we have booked over call (Not through any website) and Initially thought we will reach this place on arrival day and we will decide whether will continue with Rainbow or not, based on the place,food etc .  On Arrival around 8 AM they have welcomed with Kava Tea it was so good in taste and for the climate. Hospitality was good, so we decide that we are going to continue here for rest of our days.

At Rainbow, I made friends, who supported me wholeheartedly, and I am now (proudly, 'cause I am so not someone good with machines) solo bike rider and climber. How did Rainbow help? If you are surrounded by nice, well-wishers, you will tend to thrive and flourish. I won't go into details of how I was aided and supported, because that would mean narrating a really long story!

Even the staff is very cooperative, ever smiling and ready to serve you in odd hours. The main head of Hotel, is the mother or you can say Grand Maa, who is very concern for every individual as her own child.

I agreed, because it is in the evening, I can't search another one that time.  Since this room was in first floor, there is no working WiFi.

Rooms are clean with hot water, soap, and towels. Internet barely sends text messages but the same story is all over Leh so if you need good Internet it‚Äôs better to buy a local sim card.

The internet didnt work (sad, but ok since it was a provider issue). Also, the pressure in the shower was too low for showering, only dripping.  I told the manager that i would expect a discount, for which she refused that the room was dirty, the internet wasn't her fault and she didn't answer for the shower.   It was uncomfortable having to argue on their shortcomings only to be attempted proven wrong by the manager. Why not aknowledge the fact that the standard was low and thank me for highlighting it.

ladakh,"The 8 of us (7 guys, 1 girl) reached Rainbow Holiday Homes (Fort Road) on 30 June. This place is tucked away in a corner of Leh a few minutes away from the Main Market and around 20 minutes away from Changspa by foot, which isn't really an issue once you get used to the thin air.  The place has a quaint homestay feel to it coupled with the comfort of a guest house. We got three adjacent rooms on the first floor, all of which were very spacious, well-lit, carpeted, clean and had big cozy beds. The toilets were clean, modern, spacious and had running hot water 24x7. All rooms were equipped with LCD TVs (which we didn't turn on during our stay). The rooms on the first floor had a common area with a dining table, which was the perfect place for the 8 of us to hang out from time to",Surag N,/Profile/suragn,"New Delhi, India",50

ladakh,I normally like to recommend where I really found the hospitality and friendly atmosphere I have stayed. First of all a very good ambience with a economy stay. The food was awesome. First time I tasted the ladakhi bread over there. The stay was pleasure. Free wifi service which brings you back to connect to your friends socially. The Owners were quite helpful in fixing your problems and they recommend your further plan to visit places and if you have a random itinerary.

U can find lots of hotels and guest house in LEH but rainbow has a kind of uniqueness attached to it. firstly, it is very cheap thus value for money and secondly, it is located at the center of LEH so u can be a part of all the happening places. Staff and workers are very helpful, they can get you anything at anytime. I suggest if you are really planning to visit LEH just have a stay there and feel the difference.",Rahul Jain,/Profile/RJBlack_88,"New Delhi, India",50

ladakh,"I along with my couple of friends stayed in this hotel in May 2015 during our Ladakh travel. The highlights of the stay were convenient location, nice view, decent size rooms, mostly reliable and reasonable amenities and very helpful staff and management. Both TAUSEF TAK and his dad ( hotel's owner) are very friendly people and try to make you feel at home. We got good advice from them for our trip to Nubra and Pangong. We booked taxi also through hotel for our whole stay - comfortable car and professional driver.  Given the harsh climate conditions, challenging geography and difficult connectivity with the rest of the country, I'd say hotel has done good job in ensuring comfortable stay.

They pay special attention to their guests and are always willing to oblige. The ladies run the day to day activities, including breakfast and dinner + laundry which is comparatively cheap.For any guidance on sightseeing or taxi always speak to Nabi, who will not only arrange for a vehicle, but will advise. We had one vehicle with the same driver for 7 days. Nabi also arranged for a vehicle to drop us to Manali at a cheaper rate.

Although it's situated off Karzoo, there's a footpath through to Changspa, making it very convenient indeed. Rooms vary in amenities and price but all are clean and comfortable. The family is warm and hospitable, they have a pet cat (unusual in this part of the world), and they maintain a beautiful garden around which the rooms are laid out.",Sophie Ibbotson,/Profile/SophieIbbotson,London,50

Even though we had booked at Rainbow Guest house, due to unavailability of rooms, the owner moved us to Rainbow Holiday Homes and we liked the place. This place was cheaper than the Guest house and very beautiful. Its a new property has hence is not yet listed. That is the reason i am reviewing this under the Rainbow Guest House listing.  The rooms are very spacious with lots of windows and hence lot of sunlight. The staff is very courteous and this feels like home. The bathrooms are very clean and anybody would fall in love with this place. Don't look at eating here (food is served here, but i recommend eating outside).

So, what we look for is an accommodation with basic amenities, good care and service which isn't going to cost a lot. Rainbow fits the bill here.  The owners are extremely helpful in understanding your needs, advising and arranging all the Travel facilities you need. Not too far from the main center and shanti stupa. The stay was very good and feels like home. We get basic food here, but there are lot many options to explore in Leh. so we dont end up in eating at the Guesthouse.

ladakh,"Most of the reviews of this guest house seem to be describing a different experience to mine so I wonder if the rooms in the main house are much better than the one I had in the annexe, upstairs from some of the staff quarters. My room was bright and airy with two windows overlooking the interior courtyard (so no privacy without closing the curtains) but extremely basic. The bed was hard (which I don't mind) with a selection of coverings which were just enough for the season - any colder and I would have used my sleeping bag. The lights were just about adequate (when the electricity supply allowed) and there was a plug socket available. The room also had a chair and a bedside table or two. The room and bedding were clean but the door was ill fitting and would not stay closed",travelbsuisse,/Profile/travelbsuisse,"Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland",20

This is a pleasant little property, within easy reach of the markets and main areas of the town yet sufficiently tucked away to be peaceful and restful. It also helps that there is ample parking outside, something that can be a challenge in some parts of Changspa.  We stayed three nights in one of the older rooms, and one night in a newer one (which comes with a TV and higher ceilings, and is more expensive). Both are very comfortable and cozy, with additional blankets and pillows available on request.  The owner was extremely helpful, and offered a ton of information to help us plan our visit.

Hence we kept on requesting for hot water bags almost 2-3 times a day, to which they attended every time for all 7 days that we stayed.  The best part is that the vegetables that are cooked are very fresh and inorganically grown in the guest house premises itself.  We could see what the cook plucking them up cooking them in the pan.
