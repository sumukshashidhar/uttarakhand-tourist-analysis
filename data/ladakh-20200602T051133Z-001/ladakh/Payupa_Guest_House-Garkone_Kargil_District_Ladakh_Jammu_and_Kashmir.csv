ladakh,"My recent expedition to the Aryan valley (Dha, Hanu, Darchik & Garkone)was an life time experience, The PAYUPA guest at Garkon village was one of a shangrila of the our soul, buried inside  the apricot farms and many tiny little streams across the village. The people are very friendly. when we landed in the aryan valley we were amazed by the 10 minute steep trek across the village (short route )to reach our rooms, regular route takes about 15 min gradual higher elevation walk through the village to reach the guest house ( one should not miss that trek part, navigation is spotted by the arrow marks painted on the rocks) well maintained rooms ( especially the majestic views of the mountain) hygienic rest rooms, authentic kitchen which serve decent food and chai at all times. if u",ItsMeJegan,,"Dharmapuri, India",40
ladakh,"Ci siamo stati per un paio di giorni. La Guest house è divisa in due strutture, noi siamo stati in quella più lontana dalla piazzetta del paese (5 minuti a piedi) vicino al museo. Le stanze sono pulite e spaziose, una dispone di bagno in camere e le altre utilizzano il bagno presente sul piano, è disponibile il wifi. Il personale è disponibile e gentile. Una sera ci hanno proposto di assaggiare il loro vino seduti intorno al fuoco nel giardino della struttura. Per la colazione e le cene abbiamo utilizzato  l’altra struttura che dispone di una sala comune per il servizio. Bellissima in generale la posizione del paese",netora67,,"Bergamo, Italy",40
ladakh,"A very special experience in this little village in the Aryan Valley. Two days with the people of the village, the children, all full of curiosity and gentlness for us. An interesting trip in the semplicity of rural life, with slow rithm, great dignity and serenity. The rooms of th guest house near the little central square of the village are perfect, clean and big. The family that received us was very friendly. Interesting the old house used as museum!",Andrea D,,,50
ladakh,"The location is adjacent to the Himalayan Museum of Labdakh Culture and Heritage which is supported by the Ministry of Culture, Government of India and the Aryan village. The people in this area are believed to be the true Aryans who somehow were left behind when Alexander returned after the conquest of North Western India. The village is inhabited by this group of people whi have embraced Buddhism long back. This is the only accommodation available here and hence no comments on the quality.",Anand G,,"Kochi (Cochin), India",30
