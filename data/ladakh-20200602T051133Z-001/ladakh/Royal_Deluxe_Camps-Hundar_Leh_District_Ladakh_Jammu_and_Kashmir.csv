ladakh,Nice camps. Neat and clean. The food was okay. Electricity and water timing restrictions but easy to manage. We had camp fire late night in the cold weather. The camps had sufficient space inside and the warm blankets provided.,rupangidave,/Profile/rupangidave,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"My son and I reached Hunder at around 2.30 pm on the of 7th of July 2017. The Royal Deluxe Camp, where we were to put up was a lovely eco camp offering a congregation of cute tents with attached toilets. The warmly welcoming verandah at the front had two chairs and a round table with a marble table-top. The fabric of the tent was a neat off-white with a pretty paisley pattern and inside the tent was a large, comfortable bed with a tall cabinet on one side. There was a hook and hangers so we could hang our jackets and an electrical point in the toilet where we took turns to charge our handsets. The inevitable musky-mushy odour of the moistness from the mountain stream that emanated inside the tent took some time to settle down to; but a liberal spray of deodorant brought about",monideepa d,/Profile/monideepad,"Bangalore District, India",50
ladakh,The camping site is situated in a garden on popular willows which looks like an oasis in the cold desert. Our team had a really amazing experience at the camp and we are definately looking forward to visit there once again.,FOURWOLF,/Profile/FOURWOLF,,50
