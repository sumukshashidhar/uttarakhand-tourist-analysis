Location of hotel is very close to Leh main market which makes it a suitable place in case you love shopping 2. Hotel infrastructure is new and good 3. Nature of staff is simple and humble 4. Food quality is satisfactory   Thumbs Down : 1. Though Staff is humble and kind they miss In professionalism, like how to manage orders and client request.

Regarding the hotel amenities,   cleanliness and food it's average, but location is quite good and near the market. Regarding the service, staff and baggage security is on the stake. Our baggage's were not safe, especially when we went out for site seeing, 2-3 items got  lost/misplaced at the time of room cleaning. The reception staff as well as room service staff were not responding properly on the misplaced items; which lead to suspicion and trust on the staff, especially the service staff.

However, the hotel authorities sometimes fail to apply rules to its errant boarders. We found some tourist taking alcohol openly on first floor terrace. We complained but they didn't exert enough pressure to persuade them from doing such. The group continued their majlish till late evening. In my opinion it's a mistake on the part of hotel.
