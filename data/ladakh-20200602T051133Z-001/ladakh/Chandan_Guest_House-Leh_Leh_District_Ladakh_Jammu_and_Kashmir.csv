ladakh,"Chandan guest house is a very nice place to stay in. The family, especially the lady in charge, are very nice. The rooms are clean and the view is great. Rated 4/5 due to the location, and the very weak wifi (although almost all of Leh has bad infrastructure, some other hostels in the area had a better wifi)",Michael K,/Profile/R665XFmichaelk,,40
ladakh,"This is a pretty nice guest house. The rooms are simple, but comfortable enough. Solar hot water. There's a nice garden and a place to sit out. Mostly it's quiet, though there is some construction going on nearby. It's located near the end of the road in an uncongested area, so there's almost no traffic. It's about a 15-20 minute walk to the main market.",Peregrineri,/Profile/Peregrineri,"New Delhi, India",40
