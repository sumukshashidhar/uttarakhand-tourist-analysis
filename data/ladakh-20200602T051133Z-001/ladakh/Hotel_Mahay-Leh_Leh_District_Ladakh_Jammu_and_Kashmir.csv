ladakh,"Location wise good..at a walking distance from marketplace,ambience is serene.You can sit in the lawn and relax with a good view of Shanti stupa and Leh Palace.Upstair rooms are spacious. Food was average.On some days they prepared excellent delicacy and other day so so types. You may get the unexpected.Avoid lunch. Very few staff hinders proper services .Lazy and ever complaining staff.Everytime you have to ask to give this,do that and all.Overbooking done.So during your stay you have to shift from this room to that and this is quite irritating.Otherwise hygenic like rooms are well done,bedsheets clean.The owner is helpful.He will guide you and help you in all ways.",wanderer672014,/Profile/wanderer672014,"New Delhi, India",30
ladakh,"We stayed at this hotel for 3-4 days. Initial experience, when entered in the room was not at all good. But slowly & gradually, when the services were being provided to us, like basic amenities - hot water..ordering some snacks..quality of food. It was excellent. The behavior of the service folks  was outstanding, very well-behaved and never said really no for any kind of food. I would not really grade them as a commercial hotel but more of a home stay with basic amenities provided and homely food quality. The price at which the services were provided, was worth it. It is important to mention the name of the two persons whom we had most interaction - Khan saab and Ajit (I think Ajit, if I remember correctly)  - very friendly, polite in nature and extremely helpful.",Anshuk240981,/Profile/Anshuk240981,"Hyderabad, India",50
