ladakh,"I went there with a group of travellers. What makes the place unique, is its offbeat location. All the camps at Spangmik village are over crowded, and makes you feel you have come to a festival. However, this camp situated in Mann Merak village, provides a full-fleshed personal view of Pangong, at the same time is away from the crowded location.",Fida F,/Profile/Fida_Tangrhong,"Ladakh, India",50
ladakh,"Stayed one night in the tent. The camp is located in the calm Man village. Really enjoyed the stay which was assured by the really friendly brothers that are running the place. I can recommend this to anyone, no matter if you are a solo traveler, couple or family. ",Robert H,/Profile/roberthR6818CO,"Berlin, Germany",50
ladakh,"Tents are located at maan village, slightly away from main point but road passes along the lake with beautiful view. Surrounded by mountains and excellent view of Lake from front makes perfect position to stay. As little away from other tents, not a overcrowded place. Quality of tents are very good and newly relocated structure. Good Service and food received .",Pravin P,/Profile/509pravinp,"Sangli, India",50
