ladakh,Hotel was very nice in guest house category. It is about 10 min far from Leh airport and very close to the local market. Room was very comfortable with attached bathroom. Good for budget travelers. - See more at: http://www.travelguru.com/hotels/India/leh/hotel-sangaylay-guest-house-reviews-00002412#sthash.NGqaNz1j.dpuf,SK INDIA,/Profile/SK_Bangalore,"Bengaluru, India",40
