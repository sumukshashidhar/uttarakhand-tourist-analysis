ladakh,"We booked four rooms for a night at this hotel through our travel agent...the hotel is near main market and thats the only good point about it... The rooms are claustrophobic and washrooms are dingy...there was a peculiar smell coming from rooms which we got used to in a while..nights were chilly so we kept the windows closed... a short while after sleeping I felt some itching on my foot which I ignored thinking it might be a mosquito... but soon it grew...when I coud not bear it any longer, I switched on the light and found bed bugs!! this was the last thing I expected after an average dinner... We got our rooms changed at late night but the fear of bugs didnt let me sleep soundly...overall, a poor stay and perhaps the worst hotel on our Srinagar-Leh-Manali trip...",gauravkhattar,/Profile/gauravkhattar,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",20
ladakh,"Average Hotel for one night stay. Nice hospitality, food. Owner of the Hotel is so helpful & gentle man. You can have a great view from trace. Great value of money & time. Recommended for short stay in this homestay.",Kazi Rashidul Hasan,/Profile/boundule,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",30
