ladakh,"Took this guest house as the rest were closed in winter, dinner n food is provided. Pretty expensive.   Gave us a small heater, which was not goona do much in that cold, but that too was taken away when they switched the main lights off after 11pm, electricity bill ??  They entered our room while we were away and turned off the camera battery chargers and the laptop, while they were charging.   All in all, the only good thing was the food there. Terrible experience. Would never go back again, if anyone is there during the winter, head to Habib's guest house in Hunder, awesome place, food and people.",tkalden,/Profile/tkalden,"Dharamsala, India",20
ladakh,"It is indeed a very basic hotel in Diskit. Has Buffet dinner and lunch service. the rooms were large and clean enough, but without TV. I was given a ground floor room , and I was told that the rooms on the first floor only have TV in the room. So ask for room on the first floor",NancySukheja,/Profile/NancySukheja,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
ladakh,"the hotel is still being built so people worked as late as 10 p.m. despite the winter climate. Although there was a heater in my room, electricity goes off at 11 p.m. so it did not help much. Bathroom was locked, no chance ever for a hot bucket, toilet is outside in the garden. Dinner and beakfast was delicious, should not complain...",JambiP,/Profile/JambiP,"Yokohama, Japan",30
ladakh,"I don't know this place before. I travel to Ladakh in late October so all guesthouse in this area was closed. Guesthouse owner in Leh arrange and contact this hotel for me. It is a good, clean and comfortable hotel. Food here was very delicious. I'm not familiar with indian food but i can eat the meal that owner prepare for me. He was very friendly. This hotel not far from Hunder sand dune and market. You can use electricity in this area only at afternoon and night. Hotel has hot shower and wifi. You can see hotel photo in website. It is the same as real place. ",tawan p,/Profile/tawanp2013,"Bangkok, Thailand",50
ladakh,"The family are really friendly, smiley and humble. I don't know why but they just turn the electricity  on at 5:30 pm and turn back off at 11 pm. Probably electricity doesn't work very well over there. When it got dark, the room was cold and they offered extra blankets. I was surprised by the traditional Ladakh food which was delicious and made worth staying there.",BrazilianOfTheWorld,/Profile/BrazilianOfTheWorld,"Queenstown, New Zealand",40
ladakh,"I just came back from my Leh trip. I am really surprised to see that this hotel has no review so far. We went to Nubra/Diskit/Hunder and stayed here for 1 night as suggested by our cab driver. Honestly, it is a wonderful home stay kind of hotel whose owner uncle and auntie were extremely sweet and took very good care of us. The dining place is typical Ladakh e style. Price was very reasonable considering off season and also food was warm and delicious. From the hotel you are basically just 1-2 Kms or less from the Diskit monastery and Buddha statue. Hunder is 7Kms.",Subhronath,/Profile/Subhronath,"Kolkata, India",50
