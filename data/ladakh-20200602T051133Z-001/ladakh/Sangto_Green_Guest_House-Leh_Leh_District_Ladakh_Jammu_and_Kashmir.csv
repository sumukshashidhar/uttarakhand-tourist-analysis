ladakh,Booked this hotel after reading all the reviews on tripadvisor. Rooms were ok but service was not as expected. The staff does not listen until asked 2-3 times even for a cup of tea or a glass of water. Location of hotel is also ok. The dinner buffet was quite expensive for veg at Rs. 250/- per person and non-veg at Rs. 350/- per person. I was travelling with my parents and we did not want to have complete buffet and just dal and roti. We were however refused by the staff and since no other restaurant is nearby this hotel we had to go for the buffet for 2 days of our stay. The owner was however considerate and charged us meal for 1 day only. I think there are various other places where one can stay in Leh in a similar range and may be checked out.,Ritish Singla,/Profile/ritishs,,20

Lovely calm place a little away from the hustle bustle of the main market, Right next to the shanti stupa. Perfect getway! Must must stay!",SimranThakur1,,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"We went to Leh for 5 days and stayed at sangto green. The hotel is beautiful with an amazing garden which also has a few beautiful apple trees. The rooms were very neat and clean, also the food was simple and homely. The hotel is hardly 4 kms from the airport right next to shanti stupa, the main leh market is 1.5 kms from the hotel. We got a pickup from the airport and the owner of the hotel was very welcoming, he called us one day prior to our trip and gave us the contact details of the driver. l he informed us about the weather in leh & told us about the precautions we need to carry before we visit Leh.Overall it was an good trip as leh is a scenic beauty but sangto had a great role in making this trip a special one.

Apart from the mesmerizing beauty of the place, the friendly and warmth welcome we received at the sangto green guest house,was totally heart touching. through out our stay in guest house, the owner and his family never felt us feel away from home...the rooms are comfortable, clean and tidy.

ladakh,"Stayed in Sangto Green for 4 days/nights. Its located amidst mesmerizing beauty of the  mountains and is oozing with beauty in itself. The small garden includes colorful flowers , apples and cherries which makes the morning soothing and pleasant. The wooden chambers are cozy, neat and clean. However this is still not the best thing about the place, the people are extremely courteous and generous and you can see their commitment to make not just your stay but your entire trip a comfortable and memorable one. Couldn't thank Sundarji enough for his care and hospitality.",Yogesh220986,/Profile/Yogesh220986,"Bengaluru, India",50

ladakh,"When u r in Leh, Sangto Green is the place to stay at!!! The guest house boasts, superbly maintained rooms which would rival any 3-star hotel in metro cities. More than that, the hospitality offered by the owners is unparalled. Not to forget that you don't miss home food here... The owners care for u as any elder at home would do. You get the best of references for taxis, bikes, shopping, etc. from them and it makes the trip to Ladakh all the more convenient and assured. I have travelled a few places now in India and across the globe, and Sangto Green is one of the best experiences i have had till date!!!",Prateek P,/Profile/831prateekp,,50
ladakh,"I have been at Sangto Green for a day, the property is very beautiful with a garden full of flowers and apple trees. The owners of the hotel are very very supportive they guided me about leh. Pick up has been arranged for me from the airport to the guest house. In the day time I have also played little badminton in the veranda. They also arranged a bike for me the same day. you can have a great view of mountains and shanti stupa which is very near to the hotel. They served good, tasty & hygienic meals. I had a good time with some travellers there. I have no words to express their hospitality, such a good persons I have never met people like them in my whole life. I had a wonderful time there I would like to visit again on my next visit there.",GauravRathor,/Profile/GauravRathor,"New Delhi, India",50

We were stunned by the hospitality and the kind/helping nature of the guest house owner.

ladakh,"Happened to stay here with 4 friends. Very peaceful and hygenic place. One of my friends wasn't well so he had to be kept in Leh itself while the rest of us went to Nubra valley on bikes. Due to landslides and flash floods, we got stuck there for 4 days. In those 4 days the friend in Leh had not recovered at all. Bt the owners took really good care of him and used all their contacts to book flight tickets for him and take him to the necessary medics. The owners are a very caring couple and serve you delicious and healthy home made food. They are also a good source of information for everything. But what stands out is the care that they show towards their tourists. Our Leh Ladakh trip would not have been pleasant without the owners. Thank you for everything Sancto Green!",Pritesh786,/Profile/Pritesh786,"Pune, India",50
ladakh,"After a super tiring road journey all we wanted was a relaxing atmosphere and home made food which luckily we found @Sangto Green. It's indeed a Home away from Home.  Rooms are amazingly maintained. There's a beautiful garden surrounding the hotel and the best part is they provide super-duper food. Food was so awesome , we seldom ate outside. One of my friend fell sick and they took such a great care of him as if we were family. Took him to the hospital by themselves while we were away, made Khichadi for him, kept checking on his health while we were carelessly exploring Ladakh coz we knew that he was been taken good care of.  They used to drop us to the market even though it's just nearby. Sometimes we took their cycle to roam around and they were pretty cool about it.

ladakh,I reached on 2nd Aug with friends. The entrance was beautiful with gorgeous flowers planted right next to it. The lobby was lovely - with wooden carvings and the hall was made up very tastefully - with carved tables and Kashmiri work curtains. It was really impressive. They showed me the room - the view was breath-taking: I could see mountains at a distance and lots of greenery. I miss this the most now. They'd check everyday to see if we are liking the food and discussed the menu for next day. The food was really yummy and served hot. I fell ill with AMS and migraine - the owners Mrs. Sumita Dana & Mr. Sunder Paul visited the hospital to check I was fine. Most networks don't work there. So they gave me a mobile for emergency as I wasn't keeping well. When my friends left for,VijayaSShetty,/Profile/VijayaSShetty,"Pune, India",50

ladakh,I alongwith my family really enjoyed six days stay in this guest house in the first week of June 2015. I found a home away from my home. Scenic beauty of this guest house will mesmerize you. You can see snow laden mountain's top in the morning while you will enjoy colourful lighting of Shanti stup in the evening. Host is very friendly and their hospitality will make you feel that you are in your own house. Chillness of air will be filled with warmth of the host. They are one of the premium family in Leh. Their knowledge and experience is very wide. They have good exposure to our country. I spent so many hours leisurely talking with them. I am very much thankful of them for proving budget stay and tasty food. I strongly recommend this guest house at Leh for your destination for,dbandhu38224,/Profile/dbandhu38224,"Chennai, India",50
