ladakh,I have stayed there in 1st week of Sep -19. The staff is courteous & always wear the pleasing smile on their face. Mrs. Diskit & house keeping boy Bipin stands out & can give competition to any five star hotel in terms of taking care of customer. The rooms are of decent size & there is no compromise on cleanliness & hygiene in any of the aspect. They have even served us our choice of food even though when it was not there on Menu card. I had Poha for breakfast which is very unusual in that part of India. Food preparation is also as per the taste requirement.  Some of the rooms are having awesome glacier view & I absolutely love it.  The big open space at first floor presents a lovely view of surrounding while sipping tea .  The place is also very near to the main market . It is,j_piyush,/Profile/j_piyush,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Its location is just perfect - just 150 M from the main market, and a bit away from the main polluted road. And it's a big, comfortable Hotel to stay in. For me the icing on the cake though was Sanjay and Ms Diskit's terrific professionalism and hospitality - extremely polite, humble, and might I add 'caring'.  After running the Ladakh half marathon, I was exhausted and my heartbeat became a bit irregular. The staff was most helpful at this point, in coming up to my room(since i was unable to move), measure the oxygen level in my blood, and advise me about nearby clinics and hospitals. And this isn't an isolated incident, the staff was most helpful at ALL times.",Saumyajit,/Profile/Saumyajit1,,50

Since Leh was the base for us we opted for this highly recommended hotel and we were amazed at the high standards of quality and services being meted out tirelessly by the staff 24*7. Spacious and neat and tidy rooms with a beautiful view of snow capped mountains was the expectation after reading other reviews. However what stood out was the level of personalised service  being rendered by a highly skilled team of ever helpful locals.

The rooms are neatly done and the eye for detail is evident in small little things.

BAD points: -The lobby was undergoing renovation, so a temporary lobby was made just inside the entrance; and it was left unattended(most of the time). -The rooms on the GROUND floor were really small and cramped.The windows directly opened into the ""lobby"", or even worse, a storage room, where labourers used to work.

The hotel is in a secluded lane but very  close to the Market, which is less than 5 mins walk away. The staff was helpful and the food was also decent. The only drawback I noticed was that almost all the 1st floor rooms face the common terrace and therefore offer little privacy.

ladakh,Great staff who went the extra step to make the stay enjoyable. Great views from the rooms and the veranda area where you can enjoy a lemon ginger honey tea and watch the world go by.

ladakh,"The title says it all, every room has a view. The feeling of sipping tea while looking at towering Himalayan peaks cannot be put down in words. Add to that commendable room service and mouth watering food, it just can't be any better. It was my first trip to Leh and hospitality of Glacier view ensured it was a trip worth remembering. Also located near the main market makes access to any basic facility easy. I would recommend Hotel Glacier view highly to everyone visiting Leh.",Vikrant_Bhat_14,/Profile/Vikrant_Bhat_14,"Pune, Maharashtra, India",40
ladakh,"We were a group of friends and family and stayed in hotel for around a week and from the experience was Amazing. We experienced stay in both double rooms as well as Suites during our stay.  Each room has view overlooking mighty Himalayas and all furniture is hard wood.  Room service is fabulous and hotel staff is courteous.  The buffet was also add-on for us, they had variety of food for each day.  It's very near to main market and all eat outs.  Excellent over all",Abishek1234,/Profile/Abishek1234,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"Hello My name is rahul . I had great experience with Hotel Glacier view . Its just 500meters  away from the main market .   The double rooms and Suites are wonderful  neat and clean.  The room has  got central heating system. though we did not require any heating as we  visited ladakh in the month of August. The hotel has also got huge parking space.  the look of hotel from outside is great. it gives best look with its huge traditional/ religious  windows. The front view of hotel has got mountains which is superb. hotel glacier view has also  got wonderful food both veg and non veg.overall  The hospitality of glacier view is nice..

ladakh,"The hotel has a nice location - quiet but not far from the market. Some (but not most) of the rooms provide an excellent view of snow-capped Stok Kangri. The (refurbished, we were told, after new owner took over) hotel has good amenities (in the rooms, and outside). Yet overpriced. The restaurant has limited offering. So, I'd suggest one should avoid American Plan (all meals included in the tariff), and try out many eateries around the hotel. The new staff, imported from Agra, needs to be trained for the hospitality industry. The hotel has potential. We found the new owner regularly sunning himself in open space (nice place!). Probably he'd want to get more involved in the operations of the hotel to provide better service, improved restaurant, working wifi, telephone service in",Aalochak,/Profile/Aalochak,"Hyderabad, India",30
