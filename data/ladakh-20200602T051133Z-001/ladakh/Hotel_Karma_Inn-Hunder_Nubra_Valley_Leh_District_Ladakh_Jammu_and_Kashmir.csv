ladakh,"Location is very good, very close to the Hunder Sand dunes. Since this hotel is located in the middle of the valley you can see the Himalayan range on one side and Karakoram on the other, very clearly. Garden is also very well maintained. Food choice is minimal. Go for MAP plan, you can't go anywhere to have dinner after dark. Electricity stays till 10 PM. Lots of foreigners prefer this. Separate quarters available for drivers. Hotel Manager Mr. Krishna in Karma Inn hailing from West Bengal was an exceptionally warm, courteous gentleman. This hotel would be my one and only recommendation. Better to stay here than in tents.

There is no restaurant as such, meals are served in a canteen-like area but the food is quite good, especially vegetarian dishes, probably as they were sourced from their own vegetable garden.

The hotel front view was beautiful, very picturesque, our room overlook those snow-capped mountains ... spectacular view !!  Since it was off season, there was no staff, the owners only served us.

ladakh,"Hunder is just 10 minutes away from the town of Diskit and I am glad I chose to stay in hunder rather than Diskit. Hunder is a smaller town surrounded by nature. Karma Inn is a medium sized hotel surrounded by mountains and my morning walk in the neighbourhood was a such a pleasure. The hotel has a lovely garden with apricot, apple and other trees along with a vegetable garden. There is no wifi in this hotel and if you have a bnsl mobile you might pick up a faint signal from the near by town of Diskit. There is one Vegetarian restaurant and you are better off buying a package that covers all meals since there is nowhere else to eat.  This Hotel is clean and the Bathroom was very neat and the best that I have seen in these areas. The rooms are large and sport a flat screen tv.",SagarVS,/Profile/SagarVS,India,30

ladakh,"The hotel was nice and clean, decent with no frills. There was not much to do around, but the hotel was peaceful. Lights were out during most of the day.   The service was good. Food was average.   Not much to complain about except for the power outage, but nothing to rave about either. Room were simple and clean.",SFO_2,/Profile/SFO_2,USA,30
