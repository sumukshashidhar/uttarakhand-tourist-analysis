ladakh,"Rude, Their tariff is not fixed, it changes according to their moods, Mr. Nasir ali is associated with this hotel who is a real cheat and loots customer, would suggest not to go in this hotel and never do any booking with LEH TREK'DI Adventure which is run by same person (not safe for couples, family)",AKTravelBolgger,/Profile/AKTravelBolgger,,10

ladakh,"After a long tiring yet enchanting bike ride, here we were in a hotel nearby Leh market where we were received warmly and all the tiredness flew with the view of the hotel..The rooms were very neat and clean.. with all the comforts at their best!! The food was good alongwith the serving staff :) The owner of the hotel was a man with a pleasing personality and was benevolent.. Leh market was at a walkable distance hence could get the ""feel"" of the city as well..also nearby places included Leh palace and Shanti Stupa. So 5/5 over all for the experience and the location of the hotel..!!",Aditi B,/Profile/AditiB286,,50

ladakh,Hotel is about 1 year old. The room has good space. The restaurant offers reasonably good food. Hotel staffs are very helpful. The location is near the airport and in the city centre/market area. Overall this hotel offers good value for money & I would recommend it.,Pooja N,/Profile/poojan782,"Noida, India",40
