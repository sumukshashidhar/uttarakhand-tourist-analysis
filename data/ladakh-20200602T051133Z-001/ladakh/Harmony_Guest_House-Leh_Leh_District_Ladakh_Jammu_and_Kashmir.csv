ladakh,"Visited Leh just as the tourist season opened up for the year, and this place was recorded by a friend. Turned out to be the best recommendation for the trip.  Harmony Guest house is located away from the crowds, but is within walking distance of the main market. Three of the best eating joints here - Gesmo's, Lamayru and Tibetan Kitchen - are nearest to the place.   The rooms are neat and well furnished. There are options of 2 and three bedded rooms. TV and wifi are available in all rooms.   The best part is Tashi Cho, the lady who owns and runs the place. She is genuinely caring and very cheerful. The meals she provided on request are delicious. She makes all efforts to make the guests comfortable, including offering hot water bottles for the bed.  The guest house also",Raman G,/Profile/RamanG198,,50
