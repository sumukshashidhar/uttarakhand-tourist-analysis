The owner himself looks after the property & is very helpful. But they need to improve on the food, the breakfast & the dinner buffet spread is not very good.

Diner was a simple affair with a limited buffet as was breakfast. There was no electricity after 23:00 but we were very tired anyway so made no difference to us.

There are too many scenic views on the way, you have to leave them behind to stay true to your itinerary.  The sand dunes, the stream running through the desert, the once a year mela that we got to visit, there were too many attractions in the place to forget. Coupled with this was the really awesome stay at Hunder Resort. It completely took away any fatigue from the 7 hour journey we had to go through.

The personal touch by the owner and eagerness to ensure a comfortable stay for their guests left us with a wonderful experience.  The aspect which stands out is their food. Inspite of the limited choice of vegetables, the chef was able to present a great spread of finger-licking dishes. There was one preparation of a local leafy vegetable (quite like spinach) which was as awesome as home-cooked stuff.",GPTEN,/Profile/GPTEN,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Well appointed rooms and charming service, sums up the place.  The owner, Mr. Dorje is on his toes from dawn to dusk taking care of his guests with his old worldly charm.  The food is quite good, but we quickly tired of the vegetarian fare.  Mr. Dorje was kind enough to prepare chicken specially for us. We stayed there for 3 nights and suggest if you have similar plans to get some stores with you from Leh to help the resort stock up and serve you some non-veg fare of your choice.  All in all, a very good experience.",sanjivwagh1,/Profile/sanjivwagh1,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"The property is spacious with well maintained tents. Away from the noisy crowds, this property is one of the best available at Nubra. The tents are moderately big with basic amenities such as TV, Kettle(non-Electric), Room Service. Hot water is provided on request as there was a technical problem with their solar connection during my stay. Food offered is delicious. The staff is very polite and courteous. Every need of yours will be taken care.Request for bon-fire at additional cost as sourcing wood is difficult and expensive in that region. There is also a  fresh water stream running through the property from the Karakoram Mountain Range, just flow of water though. The property is worth",anandganpaa,/Profile/anandganpaa,"Hyderabad, India",40
ladakh,"We spent a night here while visiting sand dunes at Hunder in Nubra Valley. The rooms are very spacious with a separate sit out area and a balcony and is fairly clean. On the first day the service was quick and nice. We had to leave by 7AM the next day but there was no running hot water and after much haggling they provided hot water in dirty ""buckets"" (Picture enclosed). They had promised us breakfast at 6.45 AM but they were struggling till 7.15 AM. The food was very basic but not bad. I do realize that the place is very remote but they need to get over the laid back attitude as they work for only 6 months in a year. They provide free wifi, but it doesnt work..I dont blame the hotel but the service providers should e blamed.",Kalindi D,/Profile/kalindid_12,"Pune, India",30

ladakh,Great room. Nice facilities. Pleasant staff. Stayed here for 1 night on 16th April 2016 and it was a nice experience. Dinner and breakfast was decent. Not too great but not bad at all. Warm water availabity was not a problem.,Varun G,/Profile/varung375,"Panchkula, India",50
ladakh,Great hotel even best if compared to nubra valley hotels. The staff is very friendly helpful and feels you like homely stay. Food here is just simple like eating at home. They have very limited resources for food even milk and breads they have bring it from leh which is 5 hours drive. 24 hrs hot water. Big electricity problem but thank god they have generator. It gets chilled at night where you needs heaters and hot water bottle which they provide. I strongly recommend this hotel because I talked with other people who I met at local sightseeing they told no electricity whole night in there hotels no hot water they didn't even slept whole night. Tips take glucose D or tang powder with you and drink lot of it. Helps you in headache and gives you instant power which helped us alot.,jeetander c,/Profile/jeetanderc,,50
ladakh,"Nice location at Nubra Valley.  It is very near to the place where you can ride bacterian camels.  Spacious Rooms. We took 2 rooms on the ground floor just behind car parking space.  i specially liked the entry ( drawing room ) with huge seating place /small tables where friends can sit, eat and chat.  There is a nice garden outside,  Buffet breakfast and dinner was good. There are no places to eat nearby so food has to be taken in hotel only.  Must try their veg pakodas..awesome.  Parking space is available.  Just in front of resort, there is a house where we saw lots of apple trees loaded with apples ( travelled in month of Sep 2015 with friends)  Very comfortable stay I will surely come back.",Vipul V,/Profile/644vipulv,"Faridabad, India",50
ladakh,"We visited this place in july with friends. After a long journey crossing over the Khardung La when the hint of tiredness just started to set in, we reached this place.  Spacious room, picteresque mountains, small kitchen garden, amazing home cooked food and the super hospitality of these guys made us fall in love of this place. One of the best stays of my whole ladakh trip.",Sourasattwa R,/Profile/sourasattwar,,50
ladakh,"We stayed at Hunder resort for 2 nights and it was the most comfortable stay in Hunder. The rooms & bathrooms were super clean, the linen was at par with any luxury resort. Furniture is cute and the wooden flooring gives the rooms a very cozy feel. Food was brilliant and the owner ""Chos"" was very hospitable.  Anyone looking for a comfortable, clean and cozy stay...Hunder Resort is the place for them !!",ibAd,/Profile/ibAd,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,New hotels.. Rooms are very good  Specious entrance in room.  Nice garden and flowers  Location is nice and not too far from sand dunes  No room heater available. Major draw backs in cold nights.  Food is ok. Staff is not so supportive.  Wifi connectivity is good,Chirayu3,/Profile/Chirayu3,"Vadodara, India",30
ladakh,Had a good experience in this hotel during the short stay for one day. Food was homely and tasty. Rooms were well maintained. The village Hunder views makes us feel on the top of the world. Night stay is a must while u travel to Nubra valley as sand dunes and mountain peaks at the same location will need at least 2 days to enjoy without getting tired.,Tarun M,/Profile/334tarunm,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
ladakh,"After you drive through from Leh to Nubra, you realize that its a small village in the middle of nowhere. But on reaching the Hunder Resort we were pleasantly surprised as it was a very good hotel with all the amenities like wi fi, cable tv etc. The rooms are spacious and can easily accommodate 4-5 people easily. A great value for money hotel with amazing home cooked food using vegetables grown in their own garden. It has a very picturesque location and will be worth the stay if  you are visiting Nubra.",Avidtraveller79,/Profile/Avidtraveller79,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,Stayed on 29 th August . Most soothing and relaxing of Leh trip. Location is awesome. Rooms are spacious and well maintained. Staffs are very friendly. Food is delicious.
