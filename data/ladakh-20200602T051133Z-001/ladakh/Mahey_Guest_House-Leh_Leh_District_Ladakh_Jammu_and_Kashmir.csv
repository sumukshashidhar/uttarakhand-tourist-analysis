ladakh,"We stayed at The Mahey for about a week. The rooms were very comfortable with heating and ample hot water. The heater was great for drying clothes overnight. The staff were more than helpful, and catered to all our needs. Meals served in the dining room were excellent, with good variety. Mainly Indian with an addition of noodles and French fries! Breakfast was more than adequate. The location is quiet with beautiful mountain views. Just a short walk to the market. Would recommend this accommodation for anyone visiting beautiful Ladakh.",Sue T,/Profile/I2441XKsuet,,40

There is ample parking available for your hired vehicles. The hospitality of the resort is excellent. The hotel staff/butlers as well is warm, welcoming and friendly.  The rooms are very comfortable with adequate amenities including room heater, TV, sofaset, closet, etc. The room linen is clean and tidy. The bathroom and the loo are clean and hygienic with round-the-clock hot water.  Dining is available in the dining room as well as the bedroom. The food menu for all meals is varied, including vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. Indian or local will be made available to you as per your request. The food is nicely",adtykhndlwl,/Profile/adtykhndlwl,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"I have been travelling to Leh since last 5 years and have stayed in a variety of resorts/ hotels . Yet Mahey  beats them all in terms of location, spectacular views, value for money. Away from the noise and dust of the roads and yet close to all the attractions and  the market.  A new property with  spacious rooms, internet, comfortable beds, central heating, clean linen, clean toilets and huge windows opening to views of majestic snow capped mountain is there a better resort ? There is a feeling of openness and space in this resort unlike many of the fancy Leh hotels/resorts. One gets the feel of village life   with fields inside the campus of the hotel with the owner family farming on the land. The owners run a very reputed adventure / rafting company called Splash Adventure",manjgu,/Profile/manjgu,New Delhi,50

Thus it doesnt realy matter.I was suprised that they also had cable tv and Wifi.Food too was of good quality and enjoyed my stay.Juley to all at Mahey !",Nigel R,/Profile/NigelR232,Colombo,40
