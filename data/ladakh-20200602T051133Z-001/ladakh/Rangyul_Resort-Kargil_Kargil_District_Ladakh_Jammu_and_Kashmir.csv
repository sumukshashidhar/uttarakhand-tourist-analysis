ladakh,"We had our booking on 5 th October'19 for 5 cottages. Check-in was very fast. By the time we reached their property it was late evening we were tired n hungry. We requested soup,they served us in 30 mins. Dinner consisted of small but appetising menu. Breakfast was also the same. In such a cold weather their hostility made us feel warm. Rooms were cosy with electric blankets,few were with heater. 24Ã—7 hot running water Washrooms were clean Don't expect city type facilities..then u will be contended. Mr Hassan is a great guy with a smile and intentions to make guest comfortable. Special mention to the staff ,who were always dispensable in such cold weather. Last not the least Mr. Sonu to entertain us with Kishore Kumar's song during dinner. Overall nice experience. Thank you",SONIA B,/Profile/soniabaid,"Kolkata, India",40
ladakh,"Great stay in nice cottages, with excellent views. Cottages are spacious, the staff is very caring, they do their best to make your stay comfortable. The views from the cottages in the front are awesome. It is right on the highway, so you don't have to struggle to get into the Kargil town and get stuck in the narrow lanes. It is a perfect stay if you are travelling from Srinagar to Leh and want a night halt. The food was great too, they also have a karaoke in the restaurant which adds great fun. I would strongly recommend anyone looking for a decent and comfortable stay overnight.",nitin_khurana_15,/Profile/nitin_khurana_15,"Noida, India",50

ladakh,"This place is what exactly you would look for after a long day of drive! When we reached, the hotel basked in the golden glory of the setting sun and the sight was wonderful. They have very clean and cozy small cottages and a very well maintained lawn. The hotel staff were also very hospitable. Food is good but remember that there standard serving size is huge. Enjoyed the stay!",Sayantani Chatterjee,/Profile/SayantaniC,"Hyderabad, India",50
ladakh,We stayed here on our way back from Leh to Srinagar for two nights. Absolutely loved the place. Hotel is on the main highway before entering Kargil town from Leh side. Liked following things- 1. Well kept cottages with good view from sitout area 2. Food was good. 3. Manager was very helpful and caring  Certainly would recommend as stop-over place in this sector.,Gautam P,/Profile/gautampendse,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,One of the best hotels we stayed in our trip. Staff is polite. Food was amazing. Fresh air and the view takes your breath away. You will see variety of flowers and well maintained garden. Rooms were good. The best part of the resort is its 'peacefulness'. Don't forget to stare at the stars in the night sitting at the porch of your villa. They look amazingly clear.,Soniya P,/Profile/soniyap71,"Pune, Maharashtra, India",50
ladakh,"View Was great, Owner is very helpful, Caretakers are very prompt in service, Food is GOOD. Very nice property. Even the serve food with live stage singer Mr. Junior Kishore Kumar. In total experience was nice.",arungautam10,/Profile/arungautam10,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,We 9 people came across the resort in the afternoon. The garden and the space in the room are very good and comfortable. And the staff are helpful and talkative. You must choose here for the stay in Kargil.,Wenyi,/Profile/Nafisa00,Kaohsiung,50
ladakh,Resort is confusing why they name every thing a resort. But the stay is with the best view possible and very peaceful property. They don't provide campfire to enjoy because some localities creat trouble told the property manager. Service is efficient. We have to leave early in the morning around 5:45 am and they were ready to provide tea coffee... Food for dinner was good but little bit slow. Jain food available at this place. Room has 5-6 charging port. Parking place is less. Go for this property not extraordinary but yes worth the money  with view and facilities they provide. ,Shah A,/Profile/43shaha,,40
ladakh,"nice property located on the srinagar leh highway, 5 kms away from kargil market rooms are basic, staff is courteous except the manager. parking is limited and if you have to leave early morning that can be a big task getting your car out  no wifi sleep quality is very poor",Ashd333,/Profile/Ashd333,"Edgewater, New Jersey",40
ladakh,"The property is located on the outskirts of Kargil going towards Leh bang on the highway. This consist of huts , there are around 10 huts in the property. Provided with all basic amenities huts are big, comfortable and have an outdoor sitting area.  Bathrooms have some more scope of improvement, the washbasin in my bathroom was leaking. The view from the property are amazing, it has green farms on both sides and provides an amazing view of himalayas at all sides. A good dining hall and the food was good. In this area the mobile signals are very patchy, hotel doesn't have a WiFi facility. Overall a good property but looked a bit overpriced to me for the facilities provided.",nynikhil,/Profile/nynikhil,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
ladakh,Unexpected property at such an excellent peace pure and in between mountains... Truely a loveable place in Challenging conditions.... Well trained staff... Lovely food and clean place... Definately looking to be here again soon....,Killol K,/Profile/KillolK2,,50
ladakh,"This property has one of the most breathtaking views and an amazing staff. The hotel management is extremely cordial. The food is very homely. We stayed here for a night but after staying there, we really wanted to extend our stay.",PoulomisAbode,/Profile/PoulomisAbode,,50
ladakh,"We went in group of 10 and booked atleast 5 rooms. All our rooms were pretty spacious and well equipped amenities and facilities. It seems the hotel is a little brand new, hence the services are not that upto the mark yet an amazing stay. They have these personalized balconies outside of each cottage, they will play good music or arrange live singer for you who will keep you entertained while you re dining. Must book this while at Kargil.",jinal b,/Profile/jinalb8166,,40
