ladakh,"Excellent place to stay. Location is near airport. Guest house has a beautiful view. Most of the places to visit in Leh are in vicinity. Leh Market is just 15 minutes away from guest house. It has basic facilities like WiFi, english toilet & hot water. Food (breakfast & dinner) is tastier than expected. The best thing about this place is service by Mr. Jimmy & his team. We spent 4 nights at this guest house. Tip: Shops near this guest house are selling products at more reasonable prices than Leh Market.",Mangesh G,/Profile/mangeshgiri,,50

ladakh,"We stayed in the guest house for 4 days and just loved the place and the hospitality. Mr. Jimmy is a real time champion when it comes to service. Starting from helping with the itinerary to getting the bikes at your door step, he was an excellent help everywhere. It doesnâ€™t ends here, he also dropped us at the airport and also extended his support by providing us with his own car to explore the local market. Bingo 10 on 10 the place and to the service level. Strongly recommend this place to everyone who is looking for decent place at reasonable price and with excellent service.",joysiwach,/Profile/joysiwach,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,We stayed for around 3 days in the guest house and the best part about the guest house is the following: 1. Rooms 2. Accessibility from the main market 3. Food 4. Services The guest house owner Mr. Jigmat is the most humble person and he has provided the best services. He guided us in getting rental bikes as well as he guided us in local shopping or site seeings for an additional day that we stayed over there.  I would have rated the guest house 10/10.  I would recommend this guest house to everyone who is visiting LEH.,Binit Shah,/Profile/binitshah27,,50

ladakh,"Nice place, great views and friendly service. The room I stayed in had a great view of the Stok mountain range.
