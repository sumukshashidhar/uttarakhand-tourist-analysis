ladakh,"After checking out the local travel agencies in Leh, Ladakh regarding their travel itineraries and prices to Nubra Valley, Pangong Tso, and the Sham Valley and its majestic monasteries, I took the advice of a friend back in Virginia who was from Delhi who suggested I should get in touch with a Mr. Lobzang Rinchen of the Druk Ladakh Hotel.  She told me he would be invaluable in helping me organize my trip through Ladakh.  I'm certainly glad I listened to her!  Over dinner with Lobzang at his hotel, he was instrumental in organizing my travel plans and offered me a much better price than the travel agencies in Leh.  I stayed a total of 4 nights at the Druk Ladakh, which is beautifully situated close to the Shanti Stupa.

I will write Pros & Cons  Cons :   - Its far from the market Nothing is the walking vicinity. - Food is super costly inside the Hotel and its pathetic . - Room is okay type . - Never take any trip or Car from the Hotel they will charge you a hell lot extra than the market . - Room has a pungent smell. - Forget about internet connection though they will give you the wi fi password but it will never work.  Pro:  - There is only one which is the view of shanti stupa and the mountain.  Conclusion :   Better chose another hotel which is in Changspa road or in the market . Its a pathetic hotel with pathetic staff Specially MR. TASHI who claims to be a travel agent of Hotel . He charged 5k extra from the normal rate for Nubra , pangong Tso and Tsomuriri .

ladakh,Recently were there for 5 nights with other 4 couple friends. We first checked in and were given 4 rooms on 2nd floor. With thin air we used to feel lot of exhaustion. Elevator is badly needed. The rooms and bathrooms are spacious nice and clean. Restaurant needs to be refurbished and to be made livelier. Breakfast is not very good wrt South Indian cuisine. Dinner was good. But a la carte is very expensive. One mixed  veg dish is RS 510 is four star rate whereas the hotel is just 3 star. No live music . The view of the mountains and Shanti stupa from the room is good. Some of the rooms have very small TV's. There should be some indoor activities.

We were promptly picked up from the airport by a taxi that had been organized by the hotel. The same taxi was scheduled to take us sight seeing for the remnant of the trip. We were booked into the Pangong Suite. The suite was massive to say the least. A huge living room, with views of the Shanti Stupa and the himalayas, a large bedroom, a balcony, a changing room that would put other hotels' bedrooms to shame, and a fully fitted bathroom. There was a heater in the main bedroom which made staying there comfortable. The floor was wooden with rugs everywhere, so it was comfortable to walk on with just socks.

They advised us to stay in the ground floor for the first day /two so as to help acclimatization - I am glad I took their advice! It takes a day for your body to get used to the lower levels of oxygen and you dont want to be climbing stairs and left huffing and puffing( and they dont have a lift)  The food is mediocre - gets boring after the first few days and the hotel is farther away from the market but its a nice quite place - and offers the view of the shanti stupa + plus they will organise the trip to the places in and around and are quite reasonable.

Changspa is not part of the main market, but you keep walking for 15 mins and u arrive at the main market.   The Food was a let down, dint enjoy at all.

The surreoundings are green and lovely. On checking-in in the afternoon, we were assigned a room was facing the west, and it was very bright, which gave the room a very cosy feel. The wooden decor looked very smart in the bright rays of the setting sun. The room itself was very spacious and comfortable. Dinner was excellent, with a bit of a variety to choose from. That was a welcome change from the starkness of the campsite at Pangong. We had an early morning flight to Delhi. We didn't expect breakfast service, but we were pleasantly surprised when we were offered wholesome breakfast - fruit,",RajeevM19,/Profile/RajeevM19,"Mumbai, India",50

ladakh,"On our recent trip to Leh, we stayed 5 nights at the Druk in Leh. We were very happy with our stay. Relatively new hotel. Large room & bathroom. Running hot water 24 hrs. Excellent unrestricted views of Shanti Stupa & the snow capped peaks from the rooms on the upper floor. Overall staff was helpful & service was prompt. Breakfast was good, not excellent. It included eggs to order and the regular fruit, milk, cereal, toast & couple of other Indian dishes. Our other meals were never at Druk so no comments on that. In absence of electricity, generator would be on in the mornings & evenings when it was needed. The room had Tata Sky with a flat tv, adequate lights & plug points. I would surely stay at the Druk again.",MrMilestogo,/Profile/MrMilestogo,mumbai,50
ladakh,Me and my family went to Leh on 27th june.We reserved a hotel room in Hotel Druk Leh in two sessions.The 1st one was from 27th to 30th june and the 2nd was from 2nd to 4th july.After completion of 1st session we went  to Nubra valley and when we came back to hotel the front desk operator said that they dont have any room to give us.When I furnished my hotel voucher they told me that our booking was cancelled.When i called my travel agent they told me that they have not released any booking.I told the staffs named Ms Zeen  and Ms Gupta that we have paid for that room two n a half months ago.they said that they can't provide it.Their behavior  was really shocking.They were continously refusing to give us a room.They had  vacant rooms in their hotel though.I was really dissapointed,Shreya B,/Profile/shreya304558,"Kolkata, India",10
ladakh,"I visited druk hotel with my friends this summer , we took three rooms , it was a wonderful experience, the staff was very helpful & efficient. The rooms were neat & clean , however a bit smaller in size , guess all hotels are like that in this region.  I must mention that their manager Ms Zeen was always there to help out & plan our itinerary wonderfully. My special thanks to her & her staff for the lovely hospitality extended . She made our trip truly memorable. ",arunmalik,/Profile/arunmalik,,50
ladakh,"As you park your car at the Druk after a grueling drive of about 14hr from Jispa, u see the property and a smile come to your face. It looks inviting, comfortable and already ur thinking of a nice hot shower and some good food to get over a tiring day. Alas, that was not to happen. While the rooms are well laid out and quite spacious, service at the hotel is a real damper. Quality of the food is pathetic to say the least. For half the price, u'll get much better food close by at ""Jeevan Cafe"" whose pizzas & sizzlers were an absolute marvel. Anyway, coming back to Druk, it was surprising there is no drinking water provided in the rooms. While the lobby and the rest of the hotel interiors are pretty good, the dining hall is quite crappy. The excuse of a breakfast served is just",Ghost71,/Profile/Ghost71,"New Delhi, India",20
ladakh,"On my recent trip to Leh, Ladakh, I stayed at hotel Druk for 2 nights, followed later by 2 nights at the the Ladakh Residency nearby.  We were 2 families together and had a nice & comfortable stay at Druk Hotel. The scenic beauty from the hotel is very good and rooms & services were good too.   By mistake I had forgotten my Omega wrist-watch in the hotel while checking out. But the staff & owners of this hotel made sure I got it back! They rang me a few times and after taking my Calcutta address, they couriered it to me! I must compliment and THANK everyone at the hotel for this!",RajeshKejriwal,/Profile/RajeshKejriwal,"Kolkata, India",30

During stay, the house keeping staff was polite, the rooms were good enough. the staff were very helpful. one more thing i'd like to mention is that during check out i had forgotten my Tagheur wrist watch in the room. when i reached Delhi i received a call from the lady on reception that my watch . since it was not possible for me to go back for the watch, she parceled me the watch. i'm grateful for it.

ladakh,"Went as two couples and liked the place so much that we ended up staying in all four days. The staff were extremely helpful in booking and while we were there as well. if you are looking for a very relaxing place with a touch of the old rustic charm, then this is the place. I was a bit hesitant about the food initially, but we were in for a very pleasant surprise. We thoroughly enjoyed our (very long) buffet breakfasts, lunches and dinners.  The staff was extremely warm and welcoming. I'd like to especially thank Suneeta Manager, Rigzin at the reception, and Rohit.   Surprisingly, even the families who were staying at The Druk Laakh share and a tone of warm familiarity in their voices. Our experience was truly memorable. Sad, the trip ended too soon :(",Pakhiliza,/Profile/Pakhiliza,"New Delhi, India",50

ladakh,"On looking at the website of this hotel a lot was expected. Rooms were spacious and nice enough but stains on the walls and half working bathroom fixtures was unfortunate. I guess maintaining a decent property was a problem for these guys. No heaters were provided, which is surprising considering nights are almost always cold throughout the year.  Room service was terrible and the buffet breakfast and dinners were not special either. Just about enough to not be left hungry. The staff, specially in the reception had trouble understanding simple English/Hindi. A request for two cups of black tea turned into a milky coffee ?!!? The room service staff at first seemed disinterested but came around after a little tipping.  Im not sure about the quality of service in the rest of Leh,",Tranceuser,/Profile/Tranceuser,"Pune, India",20
ladakh,"We booked this hotel through our travel agent who warned us that though this was one of the priciest offerings in Leh we were not to expect anything approaching 5 star comfort.  With this background we were prepared to expect anything.  Anything except a hotel that did not provide heating when the temperature outside plunged to minus 10 degrees C.  We were provided hot water bottles to warm our cockles before going to bed.  Thankfully the body heat from our family of 4 (we chose to sleep in the same room, although we were booked two rooms) warmed up the room by about 2 AM, after which comfortable sleep became possible.  The one big positive in the hotel is the pressurized rain showers in the bathrooms that provide an endless supply of steaming hot water - the only downside being",TheItinerantTinker,/Profile/TheItinerantTinker,Bangalore,20
