ladakh,"We stayed there during May 2019. The manager Mr. Naresh is a very cordial and helpful person. The other staffs are also very helpful. The rooms are well lit and with big windows. The food quality is also very tasty. The Wifi is not great, but that is the problem of the whole Ladakh. The market is closeby and one can get emergency supplies very easily. I will of course recommend this hotel for a comfortable stay.",Debdutta B,/Profile/DebduttaB,Ahmedabad,40
ladakh,The experience was fairly good - location wise its nearer to the market area. Wi fi is challenging as its in rest of the ladakh. Food was nice and the staff was friendly. Special thanks to Mr. Naresh and the entire support people.  Thank you !,Manish C,/Profile/ManishC626,,50
ladakh,"We had a comfortable stay here in a spacious room with all amenities including 24-hour hot water thanks to the geyser in the bathroom. The manager, Naresh, kept our room for us even when we went to Pangong and Nubra for overnight stays. The service was good with attentive staff. The food was the typical North Indian fare and we thought they could have given us a choice of some local cuisine. That we had to get elsewhere. It has a nice sit-out lawn and a lovely fower hedge. We had asked for a room on the ground floor as, being elderly, we didn't want to do any climbing in that thin  Leh air. The manager duly obliged. The only drawback was that it was rather away from the main town and the approach roads were just mud paths.",818manuelf,/Profile/818manuelf,Mumbai,40
ladakh,"Except that the hotel is located at a distance from the Leg market, rest everything was acceptable.   The bathroom in room # 3 needs some repairs. Much needed hot water was available through the day. Reception is equipped with first aid box. Wi-Fi is a challenge, though, Mr Naresh Kapoor was quite helpful to provide the same.

ladakh,"This Hotel is in the main Leh Fort Road, which is very near to the market. The property was good, The rooms are clean and nice. The staff was also very supportive. The only thing i disliked about this hotel was the food. Both the breakfast and dinner menu were very average and the quality of the food was below average. Thus the rating.

ladakh,"We had to acclamitize in Leh for two days and Kanishka is one of the best places to do that. It has all the facilities and the location is very near to Leh market (15 min walk or a share taxi taking Rs 25 per person to market). They have a garden below where you can enjoy your evening tea along with very good home cooked buffet food in dinner and breakfast. The buffet would have less variety but it's commendable considering the less growth of vegetables and even lower availability of non veg options. The only issue we had was that we got third floor and since we had just landed in Leh, we were finding in extremely difficult to climb up every day. Also make sure geyser and all are working fine for your room since there is mainly solar power electricity usage in Leh. It will get",ekta s,/Profile/ektas277,"Chennai, India",40
ladakh,"We came after a long bike trip from Sarchu. Room we got was small. But it was neat. There were no hangers in the wardrobe on asking I got 2. In Sarchu hot water wont be available hence we can not take shower. But once we reached Leh we found out that in this hotel Hot water is not available in the evening. So we had to wait until next day morning for a shower.  Wifi password was given but there is no Internet. Owner said internet does not work anywhere in Leh. But when we went for lunch to another hotel, we could use their wifi without any issues. Owner was also not very friendly. Though airport is closer and standard drop rate is 300, he tried to arrange a drop for 400. When I said it is 300 he got angry.

ladakh,"Its very close to the market. You can see a beautiful view of snow claded mountains from the rooms. The hotel service is good and staff is helpful. Rooms are good and clean, not very lavish and not very average. It has a TV with DTH connection which helped us keep entertained on first day when you need to stay back in hotel to get acclimatized. If you have senior people with you, try to grab room on ground floor coz climbing stairs is tiring due to lack of oxygen.Loved the food spread everyday, they included one local dish on 2 of the days and as a variety served chinese cuisine on one of the days. Wifi connection is poor on top floors. They have a very nice garden with variety of flowers.",shrutikshatriya17,/Profile/shrutikshatriya17,"Pune, India",40

ladakh,Our stay at Kanishk was very good. Jigmith n his staff were friendly n ready to help. Rooms were spacious n clean and comfortable. The rooms on the ground floor had extra beds .

ladakh,"Its a great place to stay in Leh, comfortable and clean rooms, the ones on the second floor have a pretty nice and big balcony, if you get those rooms its a plus, however climbing up and down in Leh is not generally as easy as at other places, remember no lift. Food was okay, not great, but decent. Only one of the rooms has a geyser which is on the ground floor, rest of the rooms work on solar heaters, the staff is co-operative enough to provide hot water buckets if needed. They have a great lawn outside which is pretty nicely maintained and good for children to play outside. The wifi is there, but works intermittently, but thats a general thing in Leh.",nitin_khurana_15,/Profile/nitin_khurana_15,"Noida, India",40

Hot water in the morning was only for an hour when we were staying. The hotel is just off the fort road in Leh and about 10-15 mins walk from market.Dinner is served only until 9:30 PM.

Staff were very courteous, humble and helpful. They made our stay extremely  comfortable. The hotel is well maintained and so are the rooms.

ladakh,"I was in leh in this hotel from 15/6/2017 to 17/6/2017 and on 19/5/2017, I m very disturbed here coz of bad behaviour of staff, they do not provide proper break fast and dinner. We asked the manager for giving some quality food but they provide poori chhole bread butter and plain omlet daily. In dinner daal and aaloo only. No other food. They write in their package free wifi but their wifi was not proper working and when ever ask why inter net is not working. They have one answer only net is banned. As post paid connection is only working in leh and our internet is not working so we r dependent on their internet only. The manager is very rude and uncivilised.

The in house restaurant serves nice homely food. Don't expect to have anything fancy there. The hotel is a bit far from the town center/ market area and is in a tranquil neighborhood.

ladakh,A really nice hotel with courteous and helpful staff.  The rooms are spacious with great view of the local mountains.  The hotel is located at walking distance to main market; however if you are travelling to Airport you  got to travel some distance.  There are no fans or air conditioner in the rooms which is very common in this part of the world as it would not be missed as the place itself is naturally cool and does not require fans or air conditioner.  Be sure to get a room with balcony view as it offers the best view of the nearby mountains.,Krupesh M,/Profile/krupeshm2014,Mumbai,50

You will face this problem only if you are visiting Leh in July, rest all months should be good. - Food was really good. Better than I expected, both, Veg and Non Veg options  -vs - Electricity is a problem. Long hrs of no electricity, they dont even switch on generators during the day but only in night.

ladakh,If you like your hotel to be away from the noise and chaos of the Market and prefer some quiet then Kanishka is definitely a good place to try. Its a small Hotel located at about a 10 minute cab ride from the main market place   Upon entering the hotel you are greeted by a small little garden with a seating area and a swing adjoining it. The lobby area houses the dining area and the reception.   Coming to the rooms - you might want to choose a room on the higher floors since rooms on the Ground floor face the garden and privacy could be an issue. One of the windows to our room opened out to the balcony of the adjoining room! Also rooms can vary in size so you might want to check them out before you finalise where you want to stay.
