ladakh,"We stayed for 2 nights at the hotel and we had quite an amazing stay. Rooms were good with good enough amenities but what really stood out for us was the interaction with the owner and the manager of the hotel. Mr. Wangchuk and Mr. Sukesh helped us a great deal in planning and getting further arrangements for our trip.   They were really warm to us. We would recommend this hotel to everyone. And this comes from a 4 times traveller to Ladakh. The hotel offers a value for money stay. Similar hotels cost a bomb in Leh.  Best, Supriya & Athak",athak b,/Profile/Adventure611333,,50
ladakh,"We checked in on the 3rd of September and had an included buffet lunch at the hotel - what we were served was appalling. Rice, dal, paneer and salad - that was it!! When we asked about the lack of choice, we were told that we were the only people for lunch so that's all we could get. We asked for non vegetarian food and were told that it was Gokul Ashtami. We asked for local cuisine and were told the cook didn't know how to make it!! They then started digging up the road outside the hotel and we couldn't get the car to come up to the hotel. When we came back to the hotel after our river rafting trip on the 4th, we had to walk about 3 km in dust and road work. We then decided we were not coming back after our Nubra/Pangong trip. The one extra star is for Lakshman and Paswan who",mrinmenon1968,/Profile/mrinmenon1968,"Coimbatore, India",20

ladakh,"After summiting Stok Kangri, my husband and I were wandering the streets of Leh filthy and exhausted with our large backpacks in search of soft beds to rest our weary heads.  Thank goodness we stumbled upon The Grand Ladakh!  One bounce on the comfy mattress and we knew we were in the right place.  The whole room was so comfortable with the ceiling fan, very clean bathroom, and nice hot shower.  Our stay only improved over the next few days due to the graciousness of the helpful and friendly staff.  The location is quiet, yet not a far walk from the hustle and bustle and large selection of restaurants on Fort Road.

ladakh,"The Grand Ladakh is pretty new property and I was bit sceptical while choosing it for my stay. However once I entered through the gate my whole perception changed for the property. The staffs are proactive and cordial. They strive and get things done for you from cab booking to medicine, playing cards and what not!!!!. One more thing this property is among VERY few which has fan fitted in most of the rooms. And not the least; Sukesh (Big guy) ensured that everyone in the hotel is comfy and they are rendered whatever services they wish for.  He knows Leh Ladakh in and out and was our guide who was literally available 24x7 for any emergency. Finally; the location of the property is really good and food was sumptuous in the kitchen.

ladakh,"We had very bad experience at Leh in Hotel Grand Ladakh. Our first stay was on 11th and 12th May 2016.We faced following problems: 1. We were promised hot water in the room thru taps for.24 hrs. On the 11th evening, we wanted to get fresh after a long journey. But there was no hot water. In the morning of 12th May, when we were supposed to leave for the site seeing, there were all running around to show that all the staff was trying to provide hot water to guests. All the promises of 10 minutes and 15 minutes, but we could not get hot water in the end. Bathing at freezing temperatures with chilled water is the new experience that we could add to. 2. When we returned in the evening we demanded for hot water and we were promised that the lapses in the system are overcome and that",sachink2110,/Profile/sachink2110,"Pune, India",10

ladakh,We stumbled across this hotel by chance as the place we intended to stay at was full. We stayed at three different hotels in Leh during our week long stay in the region. This one is the best we stayed at - hands down. It was a new hotel so it was not all done yet (they were still hanging pictures when we were there and they even asked our opinion about the decorations)   I love this place. The owner and his team has awesome service mind. The rate we got was so reasonable that it is such great value for money - a real find. The room has a modern rain shower with running hot water that made me not wanting to leave the shower after such a cold day outside. The view from the second floor room is beautiful with no obstruction. The bed was cozy and I loved laying on the chaise to look,LittleHawksbill,/Profile/LittleHawksbill,"Bangkok, Thailand",50
