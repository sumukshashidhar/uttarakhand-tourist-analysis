ladakh,"This is right in the middle of the city, very near to the Leh palace. We really enjoyed their hospitality and service. The breakfast served was pretty delicious. The place is very beautiful and the rooms are pretty clean.",Angad Singh,/Profile/angad2102,"Hong Kong, China",50
ladakh,"My father and I stayed at The Travellers House in 2016 and 2017, a total of 6 or 7 nights on each visit. It is really a cross between a guesthouse and a home stay, as you can sit in their lounge room throughout the day, to relax, read a book and have a tea or coffee.  It is the owners that really make the place, brother and sister Sammi and Namgyal and their mother Rigzen, are warm and friendly and easy to talk to and can help with any travel arrangements.  The rooms are neat and tidy and well priced. The bathrooms are squeaky clean and have reliable hot showers.  The breakfast each morning (150Rs pp) is the best we have had in Ladakh. Homemade Ladakhi bread and apricot jam, tomato omlette and tea or coffee.",Dale Holmes,/Profile/DaleHolmes,"Hobart, Australia",50
ladakh,"We booked the first 6 nights in advance and finally stayed 13 nights because we felt at home. This place is located close to everything you'll need, but in a calm side street so it feels remote enough to relax and read a book as well. The rooms are nice, clean and simple, the family is friendly and helpful. There's a beautiful garden where we enjoyed sitting outside every morning having tasty breakfast (sometimes even with self-made bread). Definitly a place to recommend - and come back!",KatrinscheM,/Profile/KatrinscheM,"Cologne, Germany",50
ladakh,"Stayed here and booked 2 rooms for 4 people. The location is decent, rooms are great, hosts are very helpful and guiding. Moreover, there are green apple trees within the property, so we can grab some quick bites. Worth the stay.",GauravAgrawalPml,/Profile/GauravAgrawalPml,,50
ladakh,It was my first time in India and my 2 week stay in Leh has been a wonderful experience. The place is rightly located with pleasant surroundings. Everyone had been a nice host. Thank you all for a wonderful holiday,simeone2017,/Profile/simeone2017,"New Bern, North Carolina",50
ladakh,"We stayed at travellers house for 6 nights in September 15 and it's perfect if you're on a budget. The room was spacious, clean and a great hot shower. The host family were lovely and so is their cute little dog who'd love watching as come and go. ",travelinthemix,/Profile/travelinthemix,"London, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"A peaceful place, close to everything, 2 minutes walking from Changspa and 5 minutes walking from main bazar, but still very quiet. Hot water 24/7 and very nice owner. Special view from the roof. In high season book it before,",Dcf1983,/Profile/Dcf1983,"Sao Paulo, SP",50
ladakh,"We stayed 2 nights here before doing a trek in the Markha Valley. The staff - a family were very helpful in providing advice on laundry, where to buy gas for stove, hiking preparations and altitude sickness prevention. Only 5 min walk away is everything you need - food, groceries, laundry, restaurants, cafes and tour companies. The room was ok. The advantages were the great staff who let us leave our heavier luggage while we did our trek and the location - quiet.",susan g,/Profile/679susang,melbourne,40
ladakh,"It was a really good experience to stay in this guesthouse. The family is really helpful with information and whatever you need. I had an allergy problem because of the carpet (Leh is in a desert, so there is some dust and it's dry) and they went right away to clean the room with the vacuum cleaner. It is also possible to go to the rooftop to see the stars (that are really clear since it's high), specially when there is no power (what is common on Leh).",ivanzp,/Profile/ivanzp,"Prague, Czech Republic",40
ladakh,"This is a lovely guesthouse and extremely good value. The rooms are large and spacious as are the bathrooms. It is well located for easy access to town centre. The family that own the property are very friendly, welcoming and will to help with any queries (like ordering a taxi to get to the airport), apples from their tree for our trek.  For me the only problem was the lack of catering. Whilst given tea when we first arrived it was not possible to get chai at other times. Meaning that we had to go out for breakfast before getting our first cup of the day! AS a chai addict this for me was a problem.  But considering the comfort, warm welcome and reasonable cost I have no reason to complain. A very good choice in Leh",mirandaburcot,/Profile/mirandaburcot,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"I was here last summer for 7 days. The family was very friendly and they were very helpful when we went trekking, they even let us store some of our excess luggage. The location is great because it's close to Changspa Road (if you take the shortcut behind the pond), which has a ""younger"" feel to it and has a lot of places to eat and shop. There is only a 10 minute walk to the center of town. I will definitely come back to this place again and would recommend it to anyone going to Leh.",Ulrik M,/Profile/ulrikm_13,"Aarhus, Arhus, Denmark",50
ladakh,"I am a student from the United States currently studying abroad and was lucky enough to get to stay at Traveller's House for three nights over one of our ten day breaks. It was honestly the best guest house I have stayed in during my entire time in India!   The location and decor alone are perfect. It truly felt like a homey bed and breakfast. I would highly recommend this! They also gave us a list of ""local"" food places that were amazing! I had the most wonderful time with them and I hope to go back someday soon!",442Kelly,/Profile/442Kelly,"Melbourne, Australia",40
