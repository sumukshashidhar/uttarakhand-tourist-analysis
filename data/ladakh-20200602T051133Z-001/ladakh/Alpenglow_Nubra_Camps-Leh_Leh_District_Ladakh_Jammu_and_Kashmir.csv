ladakh,Alpenglow Nubra camps is located at the end of the street in Ombay of Hunder area. I liked it as the location is away from the hustle bustle of the area and camps have a serene surroundings. surroundings are very green and one sees the mountain range in front. The tents are comfortable with attached toilet and bath. They give you enough protection in the chilly weather. The staff is very helpful and greet you with a hot cup of tea on arrival. Once is made feel welcome. There is provision of a campfire every night. Overall a very satisfying experience.  the breakfast and meals are included,mohtaanup,/Profile/mohtaanup,Delhi,50
