ladakh,Comfortable country guesthouse in a very quiet location. The buffet food was very good. Service was exceptional and Bozo the local (owner or manager) dog was friendly and a blast. There really aren't a lot of choices in and around Alchi and watching/photographing the villagers gather up the barley was worth spending the night.,Clayhaus,/Profile/clayhaus,"Salt Lake City, Utah",40
ladakh,"If you are looking for reasonably-priced and cozy accommodation in Alchi, Ladakh, we highly recommend Lotsava guest house. We (a group of five travellers) spent there two nights in July 2015 without any prior reservation. The guest house is actually a house of a lovely elderly couple, who have been living there all their lives. The rooms are clean and neat and have private bathrooms. There was not running hot water at the time of our stay but it was easily available in buckets. The guest house is situated aside from the main road very close to the Monastery (actually right on the way to it). The area is very quiet and inspiring. We are sure anyone would enjoy their stay there. How to reach: from the local bus stand walk left towards Alchi Resort hotel. Right before the Resort",tanjasutra,/Profile/tanjasutra,"Moscow, Russia",50
