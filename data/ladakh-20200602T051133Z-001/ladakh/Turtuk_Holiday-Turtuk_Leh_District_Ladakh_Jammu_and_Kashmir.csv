ladakh,"A very nice place, a wonder in the middle of nowhere. The scattered cottages were surrounded by a beautiful well tended garden. They gave us extra blankets and hot water bottles. The room was spacious, and clean, as well as the bathroom. Hot water only in the morning at 7:00. Power from 6:30 pm till 23:00. The staff was nice and accommodating.  Friendly and helpful manager. Food was satisfying, though somehow strange to have ‚Äòpasta‚Äô! Pity we couldn‚Äôt taste the Balti cuisine. A great place to stay. Turtuk is one of the northernmost villages in India.

Hotel staff is very accommodating and helpful. The Rajma chawal is the best we have ever had.  We reached here quiet late and it was not possible to purchase Turtuk's renowned apricots from the village. As we were leaving for Pangong very early morning next day, we were pleasantly surprised as the hotel staff arranged a few bags overnight.  The hotel also arranged for an early morning guide for the village walk, which we really enjoyed.

However, we felt that Turtuk has much more to offer and we had no time to explore this amazingly beautiful village.

The drive yielded some fantastic scenery but the roads were mostly in bad shape specially the last 20kms to the village.The lower village is nothing special....there is a 'museum' of sorts with a caretaker who means well but there's nothing to see. The upper village is beautiful with lush green farms,white buckwheat flowers,apricot trees etc. with the backdrop of lofty mountains,painting a very pretty picture ! We spent a couple of hours there wandering around in the afternoon heat.

Dinner was delicious served with aplomb by Rashid explaining his philosophy of farm to table. On our second day Rashid gave us a guided tour of the upper village accompanied by 2 of the staff carrying coffee and umbrellas! We visited the King and he showed us his family heritage.

It has very high strategic importance. When you visit the Turtuk royal house, you would learn much more. The hiking around the region is tough and scenic. Turtuk holiday homes were very comfortable and we had a lovely time. We were travelling with our family (31 members including 2 children of age 3 each).

The property has a garden area followed by a small patch for vegetables. The garden area though doesn't have much of a grass and is good enough for a small bonfire.

There are five schools in the village and every child goes to school. It's clean and quaint.

A small river flows nearby and you can go for a short trek around turtuk village early morning and experience the peaceful life of people living there. Lots of apricot cultivation around. The staff is just amazing with swift service. Good tasty food. Mr attaullah khan has helped a lot over past two years for arranging stays for my contacts.

ladakh,A friend recommended us to visit Turtuk and stay a night at this camp. I am glad we took that idea. Had the most amazing stay here. The staff is extremely hospitable. They lit a camp fire on request and provided us dinner near the fire. The food was extremely delicious just like home food. The tents were clean and well equipped with attached western toilets. There was running hot water during the day. The entire camp has been sculpted beautifully with lots of flowers and trees all around.

ladakh,"I had one of the best experiences while staying here. The hotel staff is so good. The service is prompt and Mr Rasheed, the care taker gave us the best in class service. He arranged a small tour for us to the village , introduced us to the balti food and made the best arrangement possible. The food served was freshly made and delicious. The balti food was mind blowing. He also arranged a bornfire for us at nights.  They have tent facilities which is clean and hygienic. The location of this hotel is so nice that you can hear the river side water flowing. Its very peaceful and beautiful. The plantation is also very beautiful.

The camp site was neat and clean and the food made was simple and hygienic.  His Manager Mr Ali, was kind enough showing us the two ancient villages and introduced us to its history.  The people are very soft spoken, open minded, having an high school, multiple primary schools, and a public library in the tiny village of 3000 people.

The hotel stuff gave us a local village tour which was worthwhile and shown K2 pick from a location. One con is electricity is only available from 7 pm to 11pm.

ladakh,"I rate this place very high given the sheer location, which is back of the beyond. The hardship with which they manage to deliver reasonable quality with warm smile is exemplary. The tents are basic but are attached with washroom having running hot water. The hot water however travels in a bucket with the help of human legs. The place is clean and quite habitable. Food is basic but tasty and the buckwheat Dosa is divine. The owner took us for a trek, despite it being Ramzan, which shows their commitment to the tourist folks coming to this place. The village sits on the bank of river Shyok and is a miniature Venice, where streams from river Shyok runs through the entire village touching almost every household encircling them with a soothing sound of tranquility.

ladakh,Turtuk holiday camp on the banks of river Shyok is an excellent place to stay and experience the Balti village. We stayed here in July 2013.The owner Rehmatullah Khan was extremely friendly and showed us the village in person. The camp was clean with basic facilities. The owner's younger brother arranged a candle light dinner for us as the dining tent was full. I was happy to see his presence of mind and a great dinner set up which was done by their limited resources. Dinner was good. The local breakfast of Balti's Kisir and Tsamik curd was excellent that we din't bother to eat bread or corn flakes. Over all Turtuk was an unforgettable experience which we will cherish for out life time,Sanchaari83,/Profile/Sanchaari83,"Singapore, Singapore",50

The property is locally owned and offers basic amenities and tents (with bathrooms).  Staff/Service: The staff is quite friendly and offered prompt service for all requests.  Best Part: We had a tour of the old Balti village with the owner (Mr Rehemtulla, a local Balti resident) and got a good history and perspective of Turktuk and Baltistan. Go to the local monastery for beautiful views of the village and K2. Also visit a local museum maintained by one of the decedents of the original Balti people.",sr1000,/Profile/sr1000,"Pune, India",50

This northern most village of India is 250 km. away from Leh, it opened for the tourists only in 2010.

It was amazing to see such a well maintained tents in this beautiful valley. Icing on the cake was hospitality of owner Mr. Rahmatullah Khan. Being in remote place, far away from modern civilisation, don't expect a 5 star luxury, However the tents have everything you need to be cozy, good comfortable bed, attached toilet, perfect view of nature, separate space for campfires, separate kitchen which though has limited menu but best you can expect in remotely part, most of cooked vegetables are from their own organic kitchen garden.

This is the best accommodation you can get at Turtuk with some very nice hospitality by Khan brothers. Do take the guided tour of Turtuk village to understand the Balti culture and if possible, do ask the Khan brothers to arrange for you some Balti dishes.

It‚Äôs an amazing place with highly commendable service and a very friendly staff, it would be worthwhile to visit the Turtuk village which is just at walking distance, or visit the river nearby! In afternoon you can just sleep outside over mats or play cards under the trees, away from the sun beating down! The best part is discovering many interesting facts about the village Turtuk and also eating juicy, delicious fruits, dry fruits. The natural fridges are amazing. There is also a good chance to meet the local people, socialize with them, and also meet the local students. The food is amazing, hygienic and delicious, if you are a food lover, you can learn",Hirmay,/Profile/Hirmay,Baroda,50
ladakh,"Stayed 2 nights after a 7 hour drive from Leh. Gave us a full day to just walk around the village and temple and enjoy the view.   This area only opened in 2010 so tourist infrastructure still coming up. Just comparing this seems like the best place to stay in Turtuk.   Swiss style tents with attached bathrooms in a lovely garden setting. Nothing fancy but Neat and clean. ""Running"" hot water on demand (staff comes running with a bucket!). Tasty food.   No wifi but such a clear night sky and view that you really don't miss it.   This place has a huge heart in the form of Rahamtullah - the cheerful owner, and his family - who all take turns cooking, cleaning, guiding you around, and planting vegetables and plucking fruit. He's more than happy to give you a quick history and more",KhannuGurgaon,/Profile/KhannuGurgaon,Gurgaon,40

He takes upon himself to act as your guide and shows wonderful facts of Turtuk village, unfolds it's history and geography in front of you, takes you to the 'raja's Yabgo dynasty, introduces you to local culture, local food, fruits, farms, customs and people. Minus this, and Turtuk stay would remain to be just another relaxing holiday in beautiful surrounding. Thanks to mr. Rehmatullah for allowing us to experience and learn something different.

Unfortunately, they were out of tents (due to a group booking) except the very first one, which is #0 I guess :) Rashid (studying in Bangalore) and Rahamat offered us that tent, and also asked us to join in for Balti Village tour, which we postponed to next day (and missed :( ). The tent was basic and attached bathroom looked roughly constructed! We thought we will freeze to death, but to our surprise the tents were warm in the night and we slept well :)  We were exhausted after a days drive from Leh and so we requested early dinner!!!

ladakh,I was a little sceptical about this place considering that it is one of the last villages on the Indian border. The camp dispelled all my notions. The tents were clean and tidy. The blankets provided were sufficient to protect from the chilly weather. The concrete bathrooms were also well maintained. The property is surrounded by trees which gives it very pleasant feel. Food could have been better. The management has grand plans and are currently expanding. Abdullah took us on a trip to the village and also the monastery overlooking the site of the former Pakistani bunkers. It was truly an out of the world experience.,aarane92,/Profile/aarane92,"Navi Mumbai, India",40

Turtuk is about 8000 ft above the sea level, and temperature during end of July was a pleasant breezy mid-high 20s. It was nice to sit in front of the tent as the camp is surrounded with wild and vibrantly colored blooms. Yoga mats are provided in front of each tent and you could take a short walk to Shyok river and lay your mat there. It was an especially nice gesture when they prepared a lovely dinner set up by the gazebo. A visit in the morning to the twin villages of Turtuk - Youl and Pharol was just delightful with scenic wheat fields, apricot trees, cobbled walkways, and adorable baltistan children ...

ladakh,"I visited Turtuk with friends of mine in August for an overnight stay. Turtuk, along with three other villages of Chalunka, Thaksi and Thang were with Pakistan till 1971 and have been opened up for tourism since 2010. Turtuk Holiday Camp is one of only two camp accommodations available near the main road and below the village. Run by Rahamatullah Beg and his brothers, Ataullah (accountant in Grand Dragon Leh) and Rashidullah (studying Bangalore), the camp provides basic accommodation and certainly less luxuries than the Desert Himalaya Camp we stayed at Deskit, Nubra. However, the great hospitality and warmth provided by Rahamatullah and his staff covers for most of the other drawbacks of the camp.

However, that was not the case when we arrived. Just bad luck I guess. We had lunch there and the lunch was simple but delicious. We loved it ! There is nothing much to do in Turtuk . You could trek up to the village or just go up to the river. Thats it. This happens to be the northern most part of India.

ladakh,"Stayed at this small family run camp with a guest for two nights in June. The camp is run by Rehmatullah and Atatullah Khan - two borthers who started it in 2010. The camp is basic in terms of creature comfort. Food is a choice of Indian and Balti food. The camp was flooded in 2010/11 which has affected the condition of camps. However, the location of the camp, the experience offered by the hosts and the genuine and simple hospitality compensates for the lack of comfort. Turtuk is a Balti village that was captured from Pakistan in 1971 along with three other villages - Chalunka, Taksi and Thang. The people are Baltis - they are Noorbakshis (a branch of Sufism) and claim to have Aryan and Mongol origins. The village is remote - so agriculture is their main source of income.

The camps look worn out, and there are only two tents with attached bathroom. Even they were very small and dirty, very difficult to take bath if you are planning to stay for more than a day. However all the shortcomings were washed away by the hospitality of the person incharge and the people in and around the camp. Extremely friendly people, very sweet and ready to provide whatever we need.  Food was excellent. Camps are close to the shyok river, one can walk around the village, and the upper villages of parole and yule.  If possible ask for the traditional balti food.
