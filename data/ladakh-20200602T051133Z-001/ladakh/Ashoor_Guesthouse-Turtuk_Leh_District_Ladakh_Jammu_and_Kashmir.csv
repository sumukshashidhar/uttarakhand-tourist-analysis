ladakh,The amenities were good and basic. Rooms and premises are clean. We took a romm first floor room with balcony with views of mountain. The owner is friendly and is interested talking about his village to visitors. He guided us to take a walk in the village and also told us about Baltik culture and people.,RoyRP,/Profile/royroyrp,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",50

ladakh,Well in Turtuk one can't expect a good hotel like we get in Leh. There are very limited options. Ashoor is just ok as far as accomodation is concerned. Infact they have got few new rooms but there was a Rat in both our rooms to disturb us in night. Only great thing about this place is the food. The food is veg and really good in taste,vipultmi,/Profile/vipultmi,"Pune, India",40

ladakh,"The majority of accom in Turtuk is located in the upper part of the village. It's a lovely area and will likely draw more tourists. However there is no road access. You need to walk across a bridge and up a hill.  Ashoor GH is located in the lower part of Turtuk on the main access road. It is therefore more easily accessible.  The room was clean, of a good standard and included bed, table and chairs and power sockets. There is a shared bathroom with toilet and ""shower"" (bucket) in the one room. Although small it was a decent standard for the area. There is also a separate hand basin in the hallway.   Staff were friendly and there is a restaurant on the ground floor.  Throughout the village power is only available in the evening until 11pm.  I was pleasantly surprised by the",WalkaboutKen,/Profile/WalkaboutKen,"Sydney, Australia",40
ladakh,"Turtuk is a small village about 3-4 hrs drive from hunder or diksit if you are driving directly from sumoor. The last check post ( india-pak border)  for visitors to enter is 4 kms from Turtuk. It would be better to plan for 2 nights stay. Ashoor guest house is highly recommended as it is on the way,we dont have to carry our luggage up. owner is well informed of the places to visit and the food is excellent.  The village itself is divided by the bridge into 3 parts and one has to walk to explore the beauty of all the regions. Historically it seems horse polo started here in 16th century and every year in march even today it starts from the old ground. The locals are very fond of this sport. Most of them are muslims speaks Balti language and are very hospitable. The walk to",suresh s,/Profile/525sureshs,"Mysore, Karnataka, India",50
ladakh,"This is a small guest house where you actually sleep to sound of small water fall which is behind this guest house. Very basic place but well maintained and clean.  They serve food in room as well as in dining area. Food was really nice.  People who are running this place are also very nice,  we met the guy who is owner's son,  he took us around to show the village, his hospitality was remarkable. He made  sure that we saw and enjoyed the village completely. I will any day recommend this place if you are visiting Turtuk.",Monicathakur20,/Profile/Monicathakur20,"Kochi (Cochin), India",50
ladakh,"We stayed here for one night after a long motorbike trip from Leh.  The place is lovely, very comfortable with clean rooms and bathroom.  The owner and his son could not have been more welcoming and gave us a 'briefing' on the village, where to go and what to see.  The food served in the restaurant was some of the best we had in India (amazing paneer butter masala) and the waiter was incredibly nice.  If you are taking the trip to Turtuk, highly recommend staying here.",IrishAussieLondon,/Profile/IrishAussieLondon,London,50

ladakh,"With lush green fields of buckwheat and barley, Turtuk looks like an oasis of green amidst all the barrenness and roaring torrent of river Shyok as it rushes to converge with the mighty Indus in Pakistan.Then there is the monastery on a nearby hilltop that serves as a viewpoint for K2 or Mount Godwin-Austen, which is visible far across the border when the skies are clear. On December 13, 1971, the Indian army launched an operation in the Turtuk sector and advanced 25 km extending its domain to a cluster of four villages - Dhothang, Tyakshi, Turtuk and Chalungkha. As you leave behind the monasteries and prayer flags and enter the village of Bogdang, the change is striking. The villagers here are fair and rosy-cheeked with aquiline features.

Little but clean rooms, good food, nice stuff, telling us everything and more about Turtuk. Very special village worth visiting. And this guest house is ideal place for base camp. Other day we saw some more guesthouses in vilage - probably with better view but with no car access.",Vouhca,/Profile/Vouhca,"Postojna, Slovenia",40
ladakh,"Turtuk is a small village and it is the farthest you can go as a tourist. This place was opened to tourist 4-5 years back. This place is one of the best experience you can have and one of the reasons would be the stay at Ashoor.  Ashoor Guest House is one of very few hotels located on the road. Turtuk village is on a hill where people must walk a small path (about 1 Km). Most homestays, guest houses can be reached only by walking this path. There is no vehicles that can go there. Ashoor guesthouse is located on the road and thereby it can be reached by a vehicle. There is enough place for parking bikes or car too. You can always go to village for sightseeing by walking the 1 km path but when you stay in Ashoor, you can do the same without having any need to lift any luggage.

ladakh,"The hotel is good, need not say more about the owners as enough good has been written (all true). The cook and other staff are not locals, and seem grumpy. best feature for me was the parking space available right beside the hotel, and you can see your parked vehicle parked from the rooms. Most of the hotels in Turtuk are a good walk above the road, so you will need to park your vehicles down below. Some hotels on the hill do have a parking area down on the road, but still does not feel safe enough. Ashoor is conveniently placed beside the road, and the owners are charming folks!",S G,/Profile/gomusam,"New Delhi, India",30
ladakh,"This place is registered in my mind because of only one thing: the wonderful owner Mr.   Turtuk is a small village in Nubra Valley that has just been added to tourism 3-4 years back. This place is the farthest you can go near the Line of Control or LoC.   The guest house rooms are inexpensive, considering the comfort, hygiene and peace they provide. right opposite the river (you can here the river current), the rooms are austere, but comfortable. The food served in the dining area is good too.  About the wonderful owner, who is one of the most genuinely courteous fellow I have ever met. When we asked about watching the LoC post from as near as possible, he took us in his car to the army post (till which civilians are supposed to go), which was very sweet of him.

ladakh,"We stayed here for only one night....and that was a great experience.... The guest house is a ""Bhul Bhulaiya"" with lots of staircases....so you need time to get acquainted with it and locate your room....but that's the fun part...it is painted with a lot of different colours, which give it a fresh and friendly appearance.... This place is brand new and offers good food and small, yet comfy rooms... The owner Mr. Ibrahim was always present to look after his guests... He also took us on a two-hour walking trail in the Turtuk village, which was opened for tourists only in 2010.
