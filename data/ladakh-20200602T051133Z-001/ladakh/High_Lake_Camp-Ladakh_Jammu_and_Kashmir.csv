ladakh,"If you're looking for a place that is safe, clean and well maintained, this is it. Clean sheets, safe environment, warm and hospitable staff and I am sold!  This was by far my only five star experience on a camp site. (I-kid-you-not) The camp is situated on the Pangong river amidst scenery of surpassing loveliness. My stay here was nothing but wonderful throughout. The first thing I noticed was how clean the amenities were. The bed sheets were fresh, the bathroom was state of the art and staff was so kind and friendly. I was so needy with my ""chai"" demands but the staff would just smile and make one for me every single time without any hesitation (please don't be a demanding chai-lady like me) The camp has their own kitchen and dine in area where they prepare fresh meals",M'lady,/Profile/tobychompkins,"New York City, New York",50
