ladakh,"Regal camp in Pangong is over a year old and it seems they haven't cleaned the tents since. We had a so called super dlx tent where the sheets were filthy. My wife asked for new sheets but never came. So tired she slept with a T-shirt on the pillow.  She caught a skin infection and is under medication these days.  Although meals are included, you feel that you are in some 2nd rated school hostel. The staff keeps most of the stuff for themselves and the guests are left with whatever leftovers and are blamed for not coming to the dining hall in time.  I would never recommend this place.  Management if you are overwhelmed by business, than close down a few tents or hirer more staff.  See a normal Roti and the one I was served... ",john Upadhyaya,/Profile/johnu256,"Varanasi, India",10

ladakh,Camps are well located not far from pangong Lake..Offers good views of the lake from tents as well as Restaurant deck..Super deluxe Tents look new and well maintained. Staff Service is nice.They did provide extra blankets as it is extremely windy in pangong and at night mercury drops very low. Food menu is limited but is tasty with good quality. Recommended stay! ,Jayeshkumar Panchal,/Profile/jayeshpanchal,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"This camp has a very good view of the lake, the tents are clean and well maintained.  Each room has a 'patio' area at the front facing the lake so you can enjoy great views of sunrise/chill out in the evening while the sun sets.   The staff is very friendly and helpful.The food was good and also the kitchen staff was helpful in cooking some items with customization.",Anshuman Bansal,/Profile/bansalanshuman,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,"My husband and I stayed here in mid August 2017. The Regal Camp team are helpful and provide hot tea/coffee & biscuits on arrival. It was pretty nippy when we arrived, so this was a nice way to warm us up!   The room is spacious with a comfortable bed, two bedside tables, one plug socket and a lovely, thick, fluffy blanket for the freezing temperatures at night. The en suite is pretty clean too, with a bucket and cold water for those who want to brave an ice bucket bath challenge! Each room has a 'patio' area at the front facing the lake so you can enjoy great views of sunrise/chill out in the evening while the sun sets. The sun rise is definitely worth seeing.   Every morning the team will come round with a steaming hot bucket of water for you to wash with. It honestly is the",Prcilla37,/Profile/Prcilla37,"London, UK",40
