ladakh,"I have been to Nubra 7 times, but stayed at Grand Nubra for the first time. It is at Diskit, and far from any market or town. Hotel is good. Rooms have a view of Karakoram range (see photo) and a big statue of Maitreya Budhha. Food was nice. Only suggestion I can give is that they should do something to keep insects out of their dining hall.",Subodh,/Profile/subodhsamyak,"New Delhi, India",50

Owing to some constraints, they did not have power supply during the day and were running the gensets in the evening for power. Power went out by 11pm. Overall, good place for a short stay",saikumarsn,/Profile/saikumarsn,"Bengaluru, India",40

ladakh,"Our group booked this hotel for 4 rooms and was last minutes (1 hour before arriving) informed by the tour agency which apparently the same owner with this hotel that fully book and need to move us to another hotel which was lower category (tent camp+ 1 hr of hot water) and a bit far from this location. However, we just say NO to that hotel and they changed to another hotel with hot water and better condition but still some construction inside that hotel. No energy to argue and just accepted this options. The reason that hotel have to cancel our group was because “hotel under renovation”. Next day we went to have lunch in this hotel and found out that last night was fully booked by Indian and Italian group total 11 rooms (by accident to ask their staff in the hotel).

ladakh,Our group confirmed our trip package with the travel agent who is the owner of this hotel 2 months before our arrival (at the end of March). our trip was during 8-18 Jun 2018. We were informed to be moved to another “camp tent” about 10 minutes before arrival to this hotel! Guide told that the hotel is closed as of under renovation of third floor but the info we got when we had lunch another at this hotel it was fully booked last night! Not only this hotel was changed but the guide and another hotel at Pangong lake also! This is the worst travel agent I ever deal with...,Siriwatthana C,/Profile/SiriwatthanaC,"Bangkok, Thailand",10
ladakh,"Fantastic location surrounded by Karakoram ranges and wilderness, one can see the Milky Way from here. The hotel is nicely located away from the town, service and food is very good. The staff is very warm and helpful. They are building the second floor so you need to bear with the construction work, but that's not a problem because that happens during the day time when you are sight seeing. Bathroom fittings and room/bed quality is above average. Recommended. Couple of tips - it can become very windy and dusty (remember you are in a high altitude desert), so take appropriate protection to cover your face when a strong wind hits you in this dry land.",prithvirajbose,/Profile/prithvirajbose,"Kolkata, India",50

They said we got a group booking so.. n if you want you can take your advance payment return.. we were in a family group and this was extremely annoying to spend your leisure holiday time to search for a hotel after a long travel.. when we have a mindset to go n relax,prachi o,/Profile/prachio,"Mumbai, India",10

ladakh,"It was in July when i travelled to Ladak. After being surrounded by mountains and mountains and high altitude, it was so nice to have a short break and enjoyed fresh-er air, less dusty, double rainbow at a lower altitude in Nubra  The hotel room at Hotel Grand Nubra is spacious and clean. Staffs are very responsive and have good service-mind. Breakfast is plenty.   I went out for a walk around the hotel (1-2km) as when i came in by car, there were so many inviting green scenery to go back for, like some wild plants, birds, donkeys and cattle.  It's just so relaxing.  And at dawn, up on the roof top (it is meant to be the hotel extension part), the first light shine to the top of the mountain was also very nice.",maymay662,/Profile/maymay662,"Bangkok, Thailand",50
