ladakh,"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner were provided on time and testy. Rooms are big, airy and giving good view of Leh. Small but beautiful garden is maintained with seating arrangement to get relaxed . if visited next time i will prefer to stay here and recommending  others too. As our tour provided airport transportation and as we were out for all days during day period not used airport transporation and in-room dining services",timirkurambhatti,/Profile/timirkurambhatti,"Thane, India",40

ladakh,"Had 2 stays here as part of tour in the Ladakh region. Few graces, besides convenience to the city centre, but numerous deficiencies :  1. On both occasions, rooms were not clean. Things were sticking on the floor, and there were stains (!!!) in the bathroom. 2. Toilet paper was absent on both visits, and towels on the 2nd visit. Were delivered when asked for, but this was a reflection of the cleaning and makeover one can expect. 3. On 2nd visit, I stayed in the room due to a fever. Noticed the cleaning staff threw down the rubbish to the garden, (mostly empty water bottles) from the higher floors instead of carrying them down.  4. On 2 occasions, the cleaning staff barged into the room without knocking, and withdrew any sort of apology. They tried to do this again on 2 other",Rj-spark,/Profile/Rj-spark,"Singapore, Singapore",10
ladakh,"This property has 2 wings i.e. Heritage & Modern and both are equally good so decide what you would like.The heritage wing has a total of 4 rooms. 2 rooms are attached through a balcony so its good for groups of 4-6, another big room has an unattached washroom and the 4th room is standalone.We were 9 so took the entire floor.In case of the new wing surely opt for any of the rooms with a balcony as the views are superb.Buffet Breakfast & Dinner is served in the Dining Hall on the ground floor and Lunch is on 24 hour notice.No room service or anything else.You have to get your own bed tea from the kitchen and that too after 0715 hrs ! As Ladakh suffers from excessive dust so this property needs regular dusting which sadly is missing.The property is basically run by 4 people i.e.",Shuddho G,/Profile/ShuddhoGhosh,"Kolkata, India",40

ladakh,I took a trip to Leh and we stayed here for almost 3 nights. Hotel was really nice with some beautiful views and very near to Leh Market. Other than that I only would suggest to keep a table fan or AC as it becomes quite hot in summers.,Charmi18892,/Profile/Charmi18892,"Surat, India",40
