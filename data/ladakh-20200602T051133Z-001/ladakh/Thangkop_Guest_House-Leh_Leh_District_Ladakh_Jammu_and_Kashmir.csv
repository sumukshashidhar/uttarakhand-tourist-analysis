ladakh,Wir haben die Zeit im Thangkop sehr genossen. Die Gastgeber sind sehr warmherzig und lassen nichts zu wünschen übrig. Die Lage ist in Fußweite zur Innenstadt. Die Zimmer sind geräumig leise und sauber.   Michael & Jay,M P,/Profile/415mp,,50
ladakh,"I stayed in thangkop guest house in July-Aug 2016 for over a month. For a low budget traveller/backpacker/biker, I would suggest Thangkop. The Owners are very friendly and the place is neat and clean. The view from the top of the guest house is also beautiful. During season, you can find this place cheaper than any place else. It is situated in Lower Tukcha road from Fort Road and is close enough to walk to Leh Mall Road but far enough to seclude yourself.",Madhava P,/Profile/madhavap2017,"Chennai, India",50
ladakh,I stayed for 4 days in the Thangkop guest house. I wanted to find a place that was similar to the local houses and had the ladakhi rustic charm rather than staying at a hotel. Thangkop guest house is a beautiful property located a few mins away from the main street of Leh city. The house is run by the owners (a husband and wife) who stay in the lower floor whereas the upeer floor has rooms available for guests for lodging purposes. They uncle aunty are very friendly and their hospitality is very welcoming. I felt at home here. We stayed in the top most room which was a single room on the top most fllor adjoining the terrace of the guest house. It was a very comfy and spacious room with spick and span and a large bathroom.   The plus point here was that the bathroom was equipped,Anupa P,/Profile/anupap2017,"Pune, India",50
ladakh,"Awesome place, peacefull retreat with beautiful garden ideal for meditation. Very clean rooms with patio. 15 minutes from Leh center, in a quiet neigborhood. Bike parking available. Hosts are super nice! Good value!",Andrew S,/Profile/317AndrewS,"Mesa, Arizona",50
ladakh,"Es una guesthouse muy limpia situada en la parte baja y residencial de la ciudad, a 10 minutos del centro. Las habitaciones son amplias y luminosas y las camas muy cómodas. Algunas tienen baño privado y otras compartido. Como en toda la ciudad a veces la luz falla pero hay agua caliente corriente (dependiendo de la electricidad) o bien cubos con agua caliente para ducharte a cualquier hora del día. Lo mejor de todo es la acogida que la familia te da, te sientes como en casa! Sin duda, volvería al mismo lugar.",ecuerda73,/Profile/ecuerda73,madrid,50
