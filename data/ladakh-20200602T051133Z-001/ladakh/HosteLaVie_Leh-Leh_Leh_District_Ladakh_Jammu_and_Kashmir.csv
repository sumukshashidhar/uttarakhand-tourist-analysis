ladakh,"Situated just a few metres of the Leh-Manali highway, this is everything what you need when it comes to being a backpacker. Miss Phunchok is a great hostess and her amazing hospitality makes you feel at home instantly. She directed me to a room and it was very comfortable. The bed linens and blankets were as good as new, may be it was. Got to meet a lot of people from all over the world. Miss Phunchok organizes tours and gives out bikes at a nominal rental price, which I was unaware of until I got there on a Royal Enfield.. HIT ME. Order for food can be placed with Miss Phunchok and her co workers make sure, you are served well and timely. The Honey Ginger Lemon Tea was spellbinding. The recreation room had too much of flies in it, apart from it, had no complaints whatsoever.",Eber Shibin,/Profile/ebershibin,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"We booked 4 night in advance, after 1 night we decided to go to another hostel. We have never done something like this before. From the beginning we felt uncomfortable, the staff was not welcoming and helpfull.  We slept 1 night in a dorm; there was no window, a lot of flighs, few space, and there was a lot of noise from the common area (we slept next to it, with only 1 window in between). The manager offered us another dorm, but we decided to go somewhere else. We didn’t had to pay for the other 3 nights, so that was friendley from the manager. All together, I wouldn’t recommend this hostel for backpackers.",Hella B,/Profile/HellaB18,,10
ladakh,Such a lovely little hostel. The staff are very helpful and are excellent at connecting travellers with each other for day trips and treks. I recommend the 10 bed dorm as the 12 bed is a bit noisy. The WiFi often cuts out but that’s the same everywhere in Leh - welcome to the Himalayas!!,Ele P,/Profile/Pilgrimpilgrim123,"London, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,Nice and clean place to stay. great hospitality and free breakfast. Arranged rental bike on request. Little outside from City but just 15 min away ((public transportation is available) Highly place to stay :),Manish Verma,/Profile/manishvrm,"Singapore, Singapore",50
ladakh,"It was an amazing experience ! The hostel was clean , the manager was extremely helpful , kind and strict ! The food at the hostel would be a 3/5 . I'm just 18yrs old and they helped me plan my travel within Leh . In the main market things are a little over priced and one needs to be careful while buying things , check in many shops before buying something!  The butter tea and yak cheese have a an acquired taste , but you must give it a try !",Richa A,/Profile/travelricha16,"Vadodara, India",50
ladakh,"Hostelavie is a beautiful hostel , very clean and nice informative and helpful staff. Located in a peaceful neighbourhood . There is a free breakfast which is very basic  but you can order from the menu at extra price.",RahulGaira,/Profile/RahulGaira,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,"The staff of HosteLaVie is extremely helpful, kind and welcoming! They helped me a lot after a tiring drive by bus from Manali to Leh. Despite being fully booked they found a place for me when someone canceled reservation so I could stay. They provided me by all information I needed. And I enjoyed simple breakfast, which is free. The place is really very clean and neat and it is a perfect place to meet other backpackers :) Loved it!",Veronika S,/Profile/veronikas143,,50
ladakh,This is a great little hostel. The staff are excellent in helping people with tours/bookings/taxis etc. and the food is cheap and decent. Would stay here again if I even make it back to Leh. It’s a super place to meet like minded people as well so you can hitch on to others plans. Only issue is the WiFi but it’s not great anywhere in Leh anyway. ,Alan H,/Profile/alanthemarmot,"Dublin, Ireland",50
ladakh,"It's such a beautiful n well managed hostel with all facilities that one expects. Staff were very friendly n helpful. Food n drinks served for an extra cost were excellent and very reasonably priced. The beds were very comfortable, I stayed in 10 bedded dorm it has Windows, attached bathroom with hot n cold shower and cupboards. The common sitting area and dining place were very good to talk n socialize with other travelers. They even helped with bike rentals n taxi services.  The location was a little far from the city though it was commutable by buses or cabs or bikes. ",JoyjeetM,/Profile/JoyjeetM,"Ghaziabad, India",50
ladakh,"Had gone there with the Aim to acclimatize for Stok Kangri (the highest trekkable peak in the world - higher than the Everest base camp and if super fit and acclimatized adequately, doable in 3-4 days), the giant is a 40 minutes drive away. Though met two amazing Swiss-Germanic guys, who wanted to ride bikes in Nubra. With zero plans and prior intentions of doing so, ended up for an unplanned joyous ride with them through Leh (without any further reservations). Apart from this consistent multi-cultural atmosphere, the hostel staff was kind enough to keep our heavier bags (free and they also were arranging to send a Delhi guy's bag to him through another Delhi guest), help get our bikes, had an in-house ex-guide, who helped understand Stok Kangri. Option is yours, either",Shyam C,/Profile/ShyamC111,,50
ladakh,"The staff are very friendly and smiley, I like the shower because there are many bathrooms to choose from. Traveling to the city within easy. A warm place ,Free breakfast,Clean room,But if you sleep in the room with other people who do not know, it will be very difficult.If you snore !!

ladakh,"One of the most memorable trip I made with family . Punchok Dolma ,the Manager,made is feel like family members, she is just great,very efficient,cool, and pleasant personality,always helpful,managed our tour,travel arrangement with the taxis as per our needs.Stanzin wangail,the cofounder is always in the campus,to keep the establishment running smoothly.Serves free breakfast in the morning, and lunch ,dinner as per your needs. Have their own strict rules to be followed,which is good too.We had  travellers of so many different countries at the Hostel in first wweek of May 2018  staying in the Dorms which was fun and good cultural exchange. Myself and my family will cherish this stay at Leh at hostelLavie for life.  Thankyou Phunchok,Stanzin and all the staff.God Bless.",nitinbijwe,/Profile/nitinbijwe,"Amravati, India",50
ladakh,"Phonsook and Dorje really made us feel like part of a family, both were very helpful and as ladakhis they knew a lot about the area. Phonsook was great at organising taxis and permits for visiting other parts of Ladakh, and Dorje knew a lot about trekking and helped us with preparing for the Marka valley trek. Overall an excellent stay, even if there was no wifi and it's a little out of town (only a 10 rupee shared taxi to get to the market though). Rooms were comfortable and warm and the common area was great for meeting people. Great views from the roof as well.",camerondowd,/Profile/camerondowd,"Lausanne, Switzerland",50
ladakh,"Stayed there for a good 10 days. We booked our stay on the wrong dates thinking we would take 2 days to reach Leh from Srinagar. We ended up arriving a day earlier. All their rooms were full, but they were so nice to let us sleep in the common area for a cheap price.   Dorje, one of the staffs who cooks breakfast for everyone , is super friendly and knowledgeable about the treks around Ladakh. Awesome fella, one of the biggest reason for our good time in Leh.  The manager, a nice lady who knows the ins and outs of Leh was super chill. She is the one you should seek advise if you need help with shared taxis to Pangong Tso or your bike road trip plans, etc. She also can help you get your permits done, which you need to visit the protected places.  In conclusion, I would highly",Azrin H,/Profile/AzrinH15,"Singapore, Singapore",50
ladakh,"A typical hostel has strict rules and everybody must abide by the same. Doesn't have a WiFi connection, so theme is basically to disconnect from the world. Breakfast is complimentary. Great staff ( warden and cook) helpful . In close vicinity to main city ,petrol pump and Leh-Manali taxi stand !",Manav G,/Profile/Mrgloballylocal,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"Visited this place in early sep 2017, Despite of hostel system, we booked a personal luxury room which costed us 6 times of hostel bed. No doubt the interior was amazing which excited us to book the room, but it was our mistake because we were services of hostel only not the personal room. We paid 1700rs for the room in which the hotel authority were asking us to carry our own water bottle for water, was serving 4 biscuits and bread in breakfast. Not just that, the bed had bugs too. There was no tv nothing and whenever we were asking for something like general things we get in a hotel every time same response we used ti get online booking , this is the first time taking direct booking. How can this statement justify the service?? Overall very disappointing stay.",Tanu2006,/Profile/Tanu2006,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",20
ladakh,"I don't know how to describe my five days in this hostel, the hostel experience here is just as amazing as the landscape in Ladakh. The staff is the main property of this hostel. They treat you like your family and your friends. Though they don't have wifi but that makes visitors get closer. The location is amazing too though a bit far from the market but it's easy to take a share taxi to there and only cost you like 20rps. From the market back to hostel you cam also take a taxi or you can walk. It will take you around 15mins by walking. Here is the only recommendation for accommodation.

ladakh,"My 3rd visit to Leh and 1st time stayed in hostel. Great that someone started a hostel here with perfect environment & great view of mountain from roof top. Got to know that this was the very 1st Hostel in Leh & it was a great choice for me. The staff Phunsuk was amazing, she takes extra care of each guest & tries to provide local authentic information about places. They have used nice vibrant color in dorm, ample open space to hang out, situated at a little quite place in Leh. Wifi could have been slightly better but I guess we shouldn't expect much at 11000 feet. They have basic restaurant & food is OK.  Though I had a different itinerary in my mind for travel but my trip to Leh would have been incomplete without her suggestions for certain untouched villages & houses which",KumarBornToTravel,/Profile/KumarBornToTravel,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"We spent three wonderful days in Leh at this nice hostel. The best hostel we found during our trip in India!!The structure is new and very nice, rooms are clean and really confortable. Everything, from the forniture to the painting on the walls is perfect and makes you feel at home.  In this perfect structure the best part is the staff, kind and friendly. They was always available to help us to organized the travel. Very good also the food they prepared us in the evening, congratulations to the chef!!! Thanks to all the staff for the beautiful time spent in Leh!!!!",Simone C,/Profile/J8333FPsimonec,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",50
ladakh,"Leh is a great place to be around, but expensive for a traveller for sure. HosteLaVie, on the other hand, is like an Oasis there. Cheap and best. I have travelled to Ladakh 7 times but this was the first time I found out there was a hostel there.  The team is good there taking care of you when needed. The beds are cool and serve the purpose but nothing great than that.   The Vicinity of main market is a small issue but the views from the room and the ambience do the work. A must visit place if you in Leh.  Kudos to the management team.",sayannath,/Profile/sayannath,"New Delhi, India",50
