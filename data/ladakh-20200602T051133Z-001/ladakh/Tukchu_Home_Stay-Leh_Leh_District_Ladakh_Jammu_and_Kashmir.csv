ladakh,"We recently went to Ladakh and was welcome in the amazing serene home of Tashi ji. The room was very comfortable and his collection of books was enriching. Tashi ji made sure that everything was smooth during the trip, taking care of permits, suggesting guest houses in nubra valley, and guiding with the do's and don'ts in the territory which welcomes you with less oxygen yet abundant sunshine, warmth and smile. He introduced us to our driver Paldan ji, who was fierce on the wheels yet an amazingly awesome human being. Last but not the least would like to express my gratitude for Mrs Tashi and Ms Dolma for working so hard to take care of each and every needs of the guests. Their relentless,tireless and ever smiling efforts made our stay memorable and joyous",Payel Mitra,/Profile/MitraPayel,"Kolkata, India",40

Rooms are very clean with hot water available at your convenience. Host Mr. Tashi has very good knowledge on the history of Leh, Ladakh and Ladakhis. Although, the family is very busy, they allocated enough time to talk to me and shared many exciting memories. They have good collections of books. Host Lady and her family provided me with sumptuous breakfast and dinner during my stay.  They helped me to plan my tour, hired me the best drivers and cars which helped me to see Ladakh in a very efficient way. Thank you Tukchu Home-Stay!

He gave us info on the ground situation in Leh following its declaration as a Union Territory and assured us that there was nothing to be worried about. He gave valuable input on bike renting shops (the bike we rented were indeed decent)  He also helped us organize our trip to Tso Moriri - he got us a room at a guesthouse in Karzok, planned the routes to and from Karzok. He also gave valuable suggestions on how to avoid traffic restrictions caused by Ladakh marathon on the day we were meant to leave for Karzok  The entire household ensured that we felt welcomed and as part of the family.

At our request, he arranged a cab and driver for our entire stay to travel in and around Leh. Both the car and the driver were good and the price fair.   Tukchu's location is not the best - away from the market, not a shop within walking distance, isolated area, and bad approach roads. Being a homestay, there were issues such as no electricity (long periods over 3 days), mostly erratic WiFi, and not enough hot water when the skies were overcast since the property has a solar heater.

It is a short 10-minute walk to cafes / restaurants on Changspa Road and another 10 minutes more to the main market - though to be honest, the last place I would recommend, is the market - there are plenty of other areas with stunning views, where you can enjoy pleasant walks.  The food is lip-smackingly delicious - breakfast included local delicacies like khambir - a tasty Ladakhi bread - that is not really available in restaurants.

ladakh,"Tashi and his family's hospitality adds a lot of depth to one's (already intense) experience of Ladakh.   We were a group of almost ten friends and we stayed at Tashi's quaint guesthouse in Leh last summer for almost five days. The guesthouse is slightly outside Leh (10 min walk from the main city) and is very close to the main Stupa. Nestled in a quiet and peaceful neighbourhood, this guesthouse is probably the exact atmosphere one would look for - close to the centre, yet cut out from all the chaos of a town. The urban looking glass facade of the building is probably the best part of the architecture, because it provides ample light and beautiful views from all floors at all times of the day (including splendid views of the night time sky). All the rooms are very comfortable,",Avani T,/Profile/tintin0103,"Bengaluru, India",50

Murup & Dolma - You are very sweet & adorable. A big hug to you too. Idzin - You are a princess. A cute hug to you. Stanzin - you are a gentleman and you look amazing in those hair cut. Hug to you too. Karma - A powerhouse of energy. Lots of kisses to you.  Now the time for Review:  No words to describe our stay in Tukchu home. Such a amazing family. Had a fantabulous time with them. We did such great fun things and Masti with them. It was like our second home.  Pros:  1) Everything is so good about this home stay. In this freezing weather we got running water in our wash rooms. 2) They took care of us like we are,DeepakVerma,/Profile/DeepakVerma,"Delhi, Delhi, India",50

At our arrival, Tashi and his family have been very welcoming and we shared some very pleasant time discussing about Ladahk and Buddhism.  They have been of a great help for organizing our trek in the Markha valley and when we came back from the trek, it was like being back home!   The place is really peaceful and cosy, the view is incredible and the food is delicious- especially the momos! :)  We spent hours just sitting in the lovely living room, staring at the mountains or reading one of the books lent by Tashi.

Mr Tashi and his family members are really friendly and they make you feel like u hav come to your relatives place and not some new place.....we had a very warm welcome and had a gr8 time at this place. Food was good as we are vegie and were not interested in dishes that we get in hotels regularly.  Rooms were clean & big and also they had amazing views from the windows .  (do not expect to get a hotel kind of room cleaning service every day as you are staying in a home stay.)   Best part was , we had the chance to c the mask dance festival which takes place once in a year at Mr Tashi's Village.

Every evening Tashi will sit with us on dinner and will tell us about our plans, where we can go, how the place is etc. Tashi's wife cooks really amazing food and it taste great.

ladakh,I visited Leh with my wife for 9 days and  stayed at Tashi's place for 6 days  out of the whole trip. All members of the family were very welcoming and made us feel at home while we were staying at the place. The location of the house is very nice - its just below the Shanti stupa and you can see a lot of trees and a good view of Leh from this place. The house is very well maintained with very nice living rooms and bed rooms. The food served in the house is also  very nice as well and one would love the warmth shared by the family members. The only con about the place is that it is a little far for a walk to the nearest market - changspa lane and it takes about a good 15-20 min to walk to the market. But this is a small price to pay for such a nice stay away from home. I and my,akhileshkeshap,/Profile/akhileshkeshap,"New Delhi, India",50

House: It's a beautiful and well maintained house with spacious rooms. These rooms come with an attached washroom (these are large washrooms, with running hot water and one of the cleanest washroom I have seen). The rooms offer great views of the mountain ranges and part of the shanti stupa. They have ample corners in the house for groups to sit and chat. They also provide free wifi.

For the price that is requested this equals unbeatable value.
