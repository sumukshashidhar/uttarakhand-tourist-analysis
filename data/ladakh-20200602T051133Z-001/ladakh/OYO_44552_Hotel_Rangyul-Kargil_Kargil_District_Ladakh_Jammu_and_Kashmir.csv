ladakh,"We stayed in this for 1 night with my family. Though we booked without much research as a transit hotel we were really liked the place and what it had to offer. Rooms we were given were clean, spacious with a amazing view of the mountain through the large windows and hanging balconies. Stuffs were friendly and courteous. They have suggested and arranged for LOC trip which become one of the highlights of our trip. Food was good.",Arindam D,/Profile/ad-arindamdas,,50

ladakh,"Rangyul hotel comes as a pleasant surprise..We enjoyed our stay and have nothing much to crib about . It was more than expected. ,initially we had an impression that Kargil is a small hill town with limited facilities.. Surprisingly.. the contrary turned out to be true. KARGIL has all modern amenities and plethora of good , modern and stylish hotels Aaccess to noisy market was not a priority for us  , so we found Rangul's location as its USP.. It is situated in a quiet lane with almost 360 degree vista of the valley open to view and enjoy Apricot gardens all around made the views more exciting. the  staff  plucked fresh  apricots for us  from their own orchards  and   served us  in the rooms:  a tasty  yummy treat to  have  these   golden spheres with   tender  taste  Thanks  to",Mohnish B,/Profile/mohnishb2015,Chandigarh,40
ladakh,"I found hotel massively over-priced, cashing in of course on the lack of options that travellers have, but I soon forgot the price when I felt the genuine welcome, the comfortable and beautifully clean room, the care and courtesy and kindness, and of course the real quality of the hotel structure. I got what I paid for and was very happy.  The view from the hotel was charming, across lovely marigold and vege garden below my window looking down on the raging foaming mountain river and across of course the school polo ground below and other nice views of a very peaceful and enjoyable rural mountain village setting. The help and co-operation of staff was constant and sincere, even to offer to get up early morning and drive me to taxi, which I did not need and thus declined.

ladakh,"we have been looking for hotels in Kargil as we have to stay here for one day. we are heading to Leh and from Srinagar and  there is the one day stoppage in Kargil, so we are looking for a medium range hotels and we fixed Rangyul from goibibo at 1200 rps.night including breakfast. The important point - as we are headed towards leh in a public transport bus we make some friends and two girls from Rajasthan, they won't have booked there hotel in kargil so, we take them with us to Rangyul and they won't have any vacant room then Hussain the manager of rangyul shifted us to there New hotel which is also good and also drops us in the bus stand with breakfast at 4 o'clock morning, its been a very nice experience there.

ladakh,"New hotel, big spacious rooms, beautifully designed as well. Nice balcony. We reached at 11 pm n yet they welcomed us warmly and arranged dinner for us in their terrace type of restaurant. Food was awesome.  They served their special aprocot (jardalu/ khurmani) desert and also told us the recipe! Very economical. We were thrilled to get such a nice hotel at such a throwaway price. You usually wudnt want to spend a lot at a place if you are staying there just overnight to acclamatize yourself as u head to Ladakh..felt like trip well begun",Dipika B,/Profile/210dipikab,,50
ladakh,Don't book through iBiBo or directly this hotel as they are great cheaters and the service they provide is worst.They charge money and provide accomodation to other parties. They don't respect Customers and for somebody coming from far location they should atleast have some values.Please don't book this hotel.There are lot of other hotels which provide excellent services like Zojila Residency and many others.,Varun,/Profile/varunrbellur,"Bengaluru, India",10
ladakh,Don't choose this hotel for your stay at Kargil.The hotel management is very careless and don't provide any proper service for the Customers.If you do prior booking and once they receive your amount they will give your room to other people and when you arrive at the hotel they will surprise you.The manager is very arrogant and don't even respect his customers.,holyvalance1,/Profile/holyvalance1,"New Delhi, India",10
ladakh,"We started our trip from Srinagar to Leh and on the way we stopped for a overnight stay at this hotel. 27th June Checkin and 28th June Check out. The moment we reached the Hotel the staff was so co-operative that we didn't have to worry at all about our luggage to be carried to the room. All the luggage was brought by them they did arrange it in the room. The rooms were neat and clean, washroom were well maintained, however the Gyser was not working. But the moment we informed the manager he go it repaired within 1 hour. Since we did not have our phone network the manager also allowed to make calls to our family back in Mumbai. The Wifi was also working with good strength. Overall a good experience.",rak4luv,/Profile/rak4luv,"Mumbai, India",50

The staff is extremely polite and the food is delicious and cost efficient. We were three people who shared a double room but they did not even charge us for an extra bed. On our request, they arranged us a cab for local sightseeing. The driver was extremely polite and had a lot of knowledge of the places.

ladakh,"We were travelling to leh from srinagar n wanted just a night halt option.  Rangyul staff n team offers you much more than that. They serve real good breakfast,free room service. First floor rooms are better as compared to the ground floor rooms. While on our return journey also we stayed here overnight n the owner took us to the LOC to show a pakistani village in his personal Mahindra XUV. While having dinner in the room,all of a sudden we encountered heavy water leakage from the false ceiling,but the team n the owner personally apologized n cleared every single drop of water. Free wifi.  Manager and owner both share a common name - Ali. Manager Ali is very cute n pro-active in providing service.

ladakh,"We stayed for one night at Kargil on our way to Leh. The hotel is located about 2 kms from the main market area right behind the sessions court.   The rooms were clean and large (especially room number 1 which also has a balcony) and had a good view of the river. The food was also good. We ate both dinner (paneer butter masala) and breakfast (masala omlette, toast, paratha). Mineral water was provided in the rooms at no extra charge.   The staff was helpful and polite. Our cell phones were not working in Kargil and we used the hotel landline to make calls. To our surprise, we were not charged anything for the phone calls. This was a stark difference from other hotels where we have been charged hefty rates for making calls.   The only issue was that the tap water was black in",Mohit R,/Profile/mohitraisinghani,,50
