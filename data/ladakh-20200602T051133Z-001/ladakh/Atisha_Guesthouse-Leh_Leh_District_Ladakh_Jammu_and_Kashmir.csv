ladakh,"The Atisha guest house owner lives on the ground floor of the lodge. The rooms are extremely clean cosy and comfortable. The wifi works fine for Let, and hot water runs throughout the day. The owner is extremely generous, kind and calm. He gave us an empty petrol can for our bike trip, and also gave us delicious onion pakodas which he was cooking for himself. The family is helpful in general, and only take bookings on the phone. The lodge is generally always full.",kosha m,/Profile/kosham3,,50
ladakh,"I stayed here for 5 nights with my parents as Leh was the base for us. The owners are very friendly, cordial. The rooms are neatly maintained with free Wi-fi and at a budget friendly price. A truly home away from home, the comfort level of this place makes it a must stay in Leh",Arka B,/Profile/ArkaB53,,50
ladakh,I was in Ladakh for a month and only stayed here when I was in Leh. The owners Amo and Dawa were very friendly and treated me very kindly during my stay. Left my bags in the storeroom while off hiking without any problems.,benjamin9244,/Profile/benjamin9244,"Singapore, Singapore",50

ladakh,"This guest house is located very close to the markets off Fort road. It has clean and functional rooms with running hot water in the bathrooms. For the cost they charge, it is excellent value for money.",S S,/Profile/SS230,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,We stayed at the Atisha Guest House during our visit in August 2014. The staff is very efficient and helpful and it is located at a prime spot in the Leh market and yet its quite and peaceful. I would recommend it to the travelers who are on a budget trip. But the rooms have not much view.,s0ulful_traveller,/Profile/s0ulful_traveller,"Mumbai, India",40
