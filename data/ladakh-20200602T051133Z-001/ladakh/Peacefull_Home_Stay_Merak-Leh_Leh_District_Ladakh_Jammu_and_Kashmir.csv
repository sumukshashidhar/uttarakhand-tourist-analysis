ladakh,"What better a view when you wake up in the morning, than the spectacular Pangong Tso gleaming away in front of you? Peacefull Home Stay is a cozy place in Merak, perhaps he last village on the Indian border before the Pangong moves into China. You don't need a TV here, for the view from the windows is breathtaking. The owner and host family is cheerful, hospitable, and extremely thoughtful. Although the food was plain, it was delicious, prepared by Mrs. Dolker herself.  Paljor Dolker, her husband, kept an eye on all our needs throughout the time we were in the home stay.  The bedding and blankets were clean, the washroom was spotless, and the view from our living room, kya kehne. This could hands down be the best place to stay close to Pangong Tso. Hats off to the Dolker family",Hrushikesh Kotasthane,/Profile/slickshifter,"Nagpur, India",50

ladakh,One of the best stay of our entire trip. The view of Pangong Lake from room is just amazing. You can directly see the sunrise from the room and if u are a morning person take a walk to the lake and enjoy the beauty. The stay is 5 mins walking from lake. The host Mr Kunzang Paljor and his family are lovely people. They make sure you are never short of hot tea and some delicious homemade food. Thank you Peaceful Homestay üôè,Srushti,/Profile/SRUS_SHAH,,50
ladakh,This is a small little homestay in the Merak village away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist crowd.. Me and my sister stayed at this place in mid Sep for one night..It had a room with a view of the lake.. The entire homestay was home to us.. There was no one other than us.. The homestay family stayed in a seperate house close to the accomodation.. The lake was a mere 5 min walk.. We had dinner with the family and it felt very warm and homely.. The food is very basic and one cannot expect more out there.. They provide hot water in buckets.. They have a few rooms with attached bathrooms and one room with shared bathroom..The temperatures had started dipping in the night but the bedsheets ver very cozy...The place is apt for star/sky gazing coz the sky is very clear...Please,rmarkar,/Profile/rmarkar,"Thane, India",40
