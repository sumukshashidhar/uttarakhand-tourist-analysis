ladakh,If you are looking for real comfort ....sorry this is just any refugee camp type feeling where you will not enjoy the food and also will not enjoy the surroundings as it is right in the center of the village so you will get a feel of as if you are some village - the tent beds and bathroom are OK as per location - hot water is a big issue ,Sanjay J,/Profile/SanjayJ694,,30
ladakh,"They have recently converted the camp into a permanent structure of cottages. Each of them have toilet and bath with running hot water at specified times. Electricity is a problem as elsewhere ,it is available only for three hours in the night. So schedule your mobile charging accordingly.  Food was very good, even though the choice was limited. We were getting a packed lunch next day, and they were very kind to cater to individual choices. Altogether a very good experience",njan45,/Profile/njan45,"Kochi (Cochin), India",50

Explorester Recommends - 3.7 out of 5   We stayed here for one night on our trip to Nubra. The drive to this place is brilliant. The location is amazing. But we were a little disappointed to see no camps. This hotel was initially camps (tents) but over the past few years they have upgraded it to cottages. The whole idea was to camp in Nubra so it was a little disappointing to have not got that. The cottages are average. The food is decent.  The surroundings are brilliant.

ladakh,Superb place for those who love nature and peace. Not very big place but  some where around 10 -12 tents. Tree of golden apple and apricot planted anyone can just grab and eat it. A small valley flows at the back of the back. Water flowing sound is clear and mesmerising. The hospitality of the staffs are very friendlier and caring. Must stay place in junta valley,Crispin,/Profile/FrancisCrispin,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"This camp is taken care of and maintained by the monks of Thiksey Monastery. The tents were very clean and hygienic with a fixed bathroom inside. Ample amount of space in the tent even though we were 3 people in the tent.The layout of the tents was amazing with a lot of greenery around and there was a stream running through the backside of the property which was extremely soothing to the ears. The service was great and the staff was very helpful and courteous. I actually went into their kitchen and cooked meals for my family and it was fun, the staff was very cooperative. There were charging points in every room and good speed wifi too. Lights went out at sharp 11 pm but we had a great time around the burnfire that was lit at the campsite. My family and i had a wonderful",Sonika M,/Profile/sonikam700,"Mumbai, India",50
