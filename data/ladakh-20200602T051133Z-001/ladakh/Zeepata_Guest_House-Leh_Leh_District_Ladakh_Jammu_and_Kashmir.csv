ladakh,"My friend and I spent the most amazing week at Zeepata guest house during our trip to Leh in June. The staff are very friendly, warm and extremely welcoming. It felt like staying with a family I knew for long. Their hospitality and the genuine love they have for Ladakh were very heart-warming.  Thank you to the team at Zeepata for this wonderful experience. Ladakh will always have a special place in our hearts.  The food is just great, prepared tastefully on request by chef Deepak. The rooms and the surroundings are very clean and well maintained. We stayed on the top floor.   Mr. Namgyal and Rigzen were excellent hosts, engaging in lively conversations about Ladakh, its culture and many other interesting things. Thanks to Tirtha, Santha and all the others at Zeepata  I would",Joan N,/Profile/joan_nirupa,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",50
ladakh,"I Have visited Zeepata on June 2016, This is best place to stay if you want to have Home like Feeling. Best Staff and best cook [Deepak ji], I will never forget their hospitality. I have stay 6 days in Leh and had my dinner and lunch mostly in Zeepata only.  Room Tip: Comparatively small room, Very clean, Good View[501, 502] close to balcony.

ladakh,"I have stayed in Zeepata for 15 days last year in August and September. It is a perfect place as you can have a calm and serene stay here. There is an in house kitchen from where you can get tasty and fresh food. I used to go on the roof every night and the view of Shanti Stupa from the roof of Zeepata is amazing. I think it changes its color.. may be not but i used to feel it. There were many travelers who became my good friends and we used to talk and sing and relax till late night. Very close from all the local attractions, it is a perfect and even if you are a solo traveler, you will find great company for trips from the fellow travelers staying in Zeepata. The owners are really helpful and friendly. When i reached leh, it was quite late and there were no taxis, the owner",shivee s,/Profile/shivees2017,"Shimla, India",50
ladakh,"From day one we felt like home - the clean room, the hot shower, and the hygenic toilet. Zeepata was amazing and so warm, really felt like a second mother away from home (she made us sandwiches before our track, like my mother does!)  Thanks, I will surely recommend to my friends about your wonderful guest house",ffaffaffa,/Profile/ffaffaffa,"Barcelona, Venezuela",50
ladakh,"Extremely nice ""Mama"", warm, welcoming, clean, great food! Just loved it!  Location is a bit ""far"" (5 minutes) from center, which is great because you're a bit away from the noisier main road.........  The best ginger- honey - lemon in India!

ladakh,"Zeepata! I stayed here for about a week before leaving on a trek, and when I returned, it really felt like coming come -- Palmo surprised me with dinner, and I was terribly sad to go. Zeepata is exceptionally clean & they serve great food and tea at almost all hours. The rooms are warm and sunny and there is simply a good feeling and energy about this place. I really can't recommend Zeepata enough and I hope you have as wonderful a stay here as I did!",tracyfuad,/Profile/tracyfuad,"Brooklyn, New York",50
ladakh,"Don't know where to start.... The location is ideal, situated in the gorgeous Upper Changspa. You have to walk through a easily navigable maze of stupas and other traditional Ladakhi homes to find this little oasis. When you arrive you will be at one of the cleanest guesthouses in all of Leh which has a full menu of delicious food and a terrace with beautiful view of Shanti Stupa and the Stok Mountains off in the distance. Palmo and her husband are some of the most genuinely kind people I have met in my four months in India. They helped my fiance and I with whatever we needed from travel questions to serving up traditional soup to help me get over a stomach bug–which worked like a charm. As you can tell, I have nothing but amazing things to say about this place, the staff and",erikwardell,/Profile/erikwardell,"Rishikesh, India",50
ladakh,"Stayed here three times over a month as doing side trips from leh and each time it was a fantastic experience. Probably the cleanest guest house in the country with great bathrooms and lots of hot water,  just fantastic . Food was also really good and they'll deliver it to your room too. Would give five stars but the internet rarely worked ( not unusual in leh) , staff can be hard to find and language can be a challenge, although friendly folk!",jim c,/Profile/jimcS5119DO,,40
ladakh,"Stayed here for 6 nights during my trip to Ladakh. Mr Namgyal and Mrs Palmo are very good hosts and look after all their guests very well. Food prepared by the nepali cook Deepak is excellent and I preferred to take all my meals at guest house as much as possible. The guest house approach is through small lanes from the main road (near bridge) and in dark hours, one needs a torch or mobile flash light support to reach the guest house. Overall a pleasant stay with Ladakhi family.",DipakJivnani,/Profile/DipakJivnani,"Surat, India",40
ladakh,"I was travelling alone to Leh for the first time and very much curious about my stay over there. After searching too much for my stay I found Zeepata Guest House on Wikitravel. After that I searched for this homen away from home on net. After checking about details related guest house I saw some room pictures and called upon numbers collected from net. I called upon them and my deal was final. It is situated in Upper Changspa locality of Leh which is just 10 minutes walk away from main market. Everything was in such organised way that I have no words to say in praise of owners. Though room service was available but I always prefer to have my breakfast, lunch or dinner in common room. I have full access to their kitchen and can order anything over a order book placed over there.",drashu,/Profile/drashu,,50
ladakh,"We knew we would hit Leh after an absurdly long journey and booked a room in advance based on wikitravel and tripadvisor recommendations.  For the first time, we loved it so much that we stayed there every night that we were in Leh during our two weeks in Ladakh.  Zeepata Guesthouse is located in Upper Changspa and about a 7 minute walk from the main part of town, either down Leh’s one main road with lots of traffic or through little back pathways that were really adorable. But despite its proximity, it was super quiet near the little Gomang Stupa and felt like you were more in a remote village than in the city. For 600-700 rupees ($10-$12 USD), you can get a lovely room with big windows and wooden floors that is super clean and well-maintained. We had a shared bathroom, but",OurEpicAdventur...

ladakh,"Large, clean, nicely furnished rooms. 24 hours hot water and free wifi. Very comfortable hotel with a real warmth to it. Super-helpful and friendly family that run it. Great food available and a lovely, sociable communal eating area. I only had breakfasts there, but there was a great selection of food available that was very tasty. Room was a bit more expensive than a lot of rooms in Leh, but definitely worth it. Nice quiet area away from main roads but close to Changspa Road.",sezmac1,/Profile/sezmac1,"Melbourne, Australia",50
ladakh,It was absolutely one of the best places to stay in the whole India. Stuff helped us with the mountain sickness and cooked good tibetan food. People in there made us feel at ease even if we came from the other side of the world. Rooms and toilettes are clean. Free wifi is avabile and you can also refill your bottle of water,Lucapaolomassimo,/Profile/Lucapaolomassimo,"Trieste, Italy",50
ladakh,"We found Zeepata through TripAdvisor and are so glad we did. It was our first accommodation in India and other travelers all said it was the best they'd found. It was very clean compared to other places we've stayed since, but the nicest part was when we, unfortunately, got sick, Palmo was very concerned for our well being and knew just the right remedy: lots of hot water and rice soup. Just knowing someone cared really helped us to mend.  Other nice amenities were the filtered water to fill your bottles and the upper deck/patio. Very nice.",Shanti555,/Profile/Shanti555,Manali,50

I enjoyed Fifa world Cup matches as well.  The owner and his family was very decent and polite. I highly recommend Zeepaata guest house for traveler. Moreover our travel partner stayed in another guest house for three days. They spent 250 rupees buffet everyday and not satisfied with the food. We offered him Zeepaata's buffet. They were so happy with the food.  Thanks Zeepaata for spending memorable moments with you.",Sabby2014,/Profile/Sabby2014,"Punjab Province, Pakistan",50
ladakh,I went to leh in sept 2012 and got its reference from a travel blog. I am too late in writing this review but nevertheless. If you are looking for a homestay then this is the place. It is located hidden from elsewhere near changspa bridge in upper changspa. The owner is really friendly and the food is home cooked and served as how they eat it. The view is beautiful giving front view of shanti stupa. This place is near to the famous jeevan cafe as well. Both rooms and food are really really cheap. Book it prior to going there as it is really in demand in peak season.,L0neTraveller2012,/Profile/L0neTraveller2012,"Faridabad, India",50

The family also cared for those of us who were sick due to the high atitude or other sickness.  The rooms were very nice, some of them with own bath - but also the common bath was clean and good.  The rooms were good but without heat so that Palmo (the owner) provides warm blankets during cold nights.",sap13marco_m,/Profile/sap13marco_m,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
