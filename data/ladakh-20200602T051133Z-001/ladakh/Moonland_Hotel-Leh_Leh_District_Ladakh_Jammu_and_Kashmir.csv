ladakh,"We stopped here for Lunch on our way to Lamayuru Monastery. We didn't stay here so can not comment on  the Hotel Rooms. Restaurant was reasonably clean and decent. Buffet food served to us was nothing great. Since its a running highway and well connected with Leh and Srinagar, they can do better. Having said that we did enjoy the Lunch as it was served hot. The Hotel is favorite with adventure enthusiasts who would like to engage in various activities like trekking, rafting, biking etc. They can arrange all such activities for the Residents of their Hotel.",Dalbir_S_Virdi,/Profile/Dalbir_S_Virdi,"Navi Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,It's a decent but basic hotel in Lamayouro and it's a short walk to Lamayuru Monastery (if that is the reason you might be visiting this remote town). The rooms are smallish but decent and relatively clean. There is WiFi but only at the dinning hall which is in a separate building on it's own. There is a small courtyard with outdoor sitting which is my fav chillout area in the cool of the early morning or evening. From here you have a good view of the monastery with the mountains as a backdrop. Buffet dinner was quite tasty and nice but other drinks are chargeable separately.,Rob7711,/Profile/Rob7711,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",30
ladakh,"Hotel Moonland (New) which is situated just at opposite of old Moonland Hotel at Lamayuru itself.  It is a gorgeous property with spacious decent rooms, spacious attached baths with latest state-of-the-art modern fittings and fixtures, absolutely clean white linens, blankets & quilts, a big dining hall where continental dishes are served and also most courteous staff.  This is most probably a three storied building, I just can't remember, anyway to take care of tired tourists as well as devotees who come here to pay a visit at Lamayuru Monastery, arrangement of installing a Lift is going on.  An well has already been constructed and hopefully, the lift will be commissioned shortly.

ladakh,The hotel was still in the repairing process as the insides still smelt of new wood and paint. The hotel has still long way to go as hot water was still not available 24hrs and beds were giving squeaky sounds. Overall the service was quite nice food was good.,Farhaanaaz,/Profile/Farhaanaaz,"Jaipur District, India",30
ladakh,"We happened to stay in the newest edition of the Moonland Hotel. However, the hotel was not yet quite ready. Workers were still busy with the finishing touches. We seemed to have been among the first guests. There was no reliable electricity yet and the smell of new concrete permeated the rooms. The rooms were sizable with a small balcony. The bed was comfortable with quality linen. A group of young men served us with a lot of charm. They were trying to make up for the imperfections of the physical structure of the hotel. While my companions liked the food I was less enthusiastic about it. However, I believe that the hotel will be a good option once they have overcome the birthing pains.",Eleonora_PH,/Profile/Eleonora_PH,"Manila, Philippines",30
ladakh,What a beautiful place it is! A little place with a very well maintained garden. The property is very clean and rather cute. The owners are very welcoming and accommodative. The food must be mentioned too. It is simple and extremely tasty. Just what you want. They have a wonderful view of the Lamayuru monestry as well. Please note they are not marked properly in Google. It is not in the same road as the monestry. It is along NH1 after crossing the monestry road (if you are coming from Kargil),Sayantani Chatterjee,/Profile/SayantaniC,"Hyderabad, India",50

ladakh,One enters this hotel through a beautiful garden. My room was very basic with almost no amenities.  The furniture in the room was old.  The staff at the hotel was very nice and helpful.  Wi-Fi did not work at the hotel.  Meals were good.,WonderfulWorldItIs,/Profile/WonderfulWorldItIs,United States,20
ladakh,"The hotel is rather simple, the rooms are not fancy but functional. The bed linen was clean, blankets were holding me warm during the nights, there was hot water in the bathroom (including fully functional shower) and power. The best was the friendly staff who made me lunch even though I had not booked it before and they were really not prepared for it. The garden in front of the hotel was very nice and from the entrance there’s a really nice view of Lamayuru Monastery (especially worth seeing at sunset). Food for dinner and breakfast was good even though not as balanced as we are used to in the western world, i.e. not many vegetables make it on the plate. They however made very good fried noodles.",d7ni,/Profile/d7ni,"Zurich, Switzerland",30
ladakh,"Basic accommodation as it was snowing , but a very friendly and welcoming family + amazing omelettes.  It was very cold, but there were plenty of rugs to keep us warm.

ladakh,"This hotel is a popular choice by many who are passing by. You can get a good view of Lamayuru Monastery from the common terrace. Our stay was warm, homely, and comfortable, although it was not the cleanest. But rest assured you can get a good hot shower because you will need them during those cold nights. Note however that the hot water supply is 'limited'. You get it in the late evening from 7pm onwards. The key is to take your warm shower as early as you can as the temperature of the water has the tendency to dip as the night passes.   The hosts and owner of the hotel have been especially kind and friendly during our visit - they generously offered their very limited supply of home-made apricot juice (you only get it in spring or summer) when they could have saved it for",Gaelleloe,/Profile/Gaelleloe,"Singapore, Singapore",40
ladakh,You should never expect a lot from a small town like Lamayuru. This hotel offers a lot. We had a tight schedule where we had cover Pangong to Srinagar in 2 days. So we decided to take our first break at Lamayuru instead of Leh so that next we day we would not have to cover a lot of distance. The hotel staff were friendly. We reached at dinner time and they served hot food just for as we were the only guests. They took request of what we want to eat and served delicious food in the cold night. Yes I will recommend this place if you plan to take a quick break in Lamayuru.,djbmsce,/Profile/djbmsce,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"After three days of trekking on foot, we then drove to Lamayuru and stayed overnight in the Moonland hotel. Room on first floor (12m2) with bathroom (4m2), nothing special, but good warm shower. Usual hard bed, but clean towels and bedlinen. For lunch, we had our own soup packages. The garden had the most little birds fluttering between the many flowers in all of Ladakh, as well as a sad, but funny looking, stuffed brown yak. After the visit to the gompa, we (three persons) ordered dinner with the cook and while he was busy, we enjoyed sitting in the garden drinking some beers along with walnuts we had bought along the road. For this hotel, our travel agent had booked half board for us, for which we had paid.

It was not in the plan to stay at Lamayuru but we had no option other than stopping here at Lamayuru.  The Hunt for stay started and we got this beautiful ambience just connected with the main road, need not had to search a lot as no one was outside in the night.  The Hotel had good wi-fi network at its restaurant and food was good.  The rooms were spacious and clean and bathrooms were big with supply of life saving ""hot water"".  Hotel looks simple but you will be surprised when you approach it as lots of traveller groups have their stickers sticked--and that's a great sign of respect.

ladakh,"Spent one night here on our way from Leh to Kargil. First got a room without hot water shower, but managed to get another one with a hot shower. Room was with broadloom needle felt carpet. This meant a lot of dust and dirt in the air and breathing problems. Had to sit in the window opening to get some fresh air. (ask for a room without carpet, we saw one when we left the next morning). Bed was okay, but linen could be cleaner. Wifi is a problem - didn't  work most of the time we were there. They serve a super lime/ginger drink, try it.

Hot water available .parking for motorcycles was available too. Food was brilliant . The traditional Ladakhi thukpa & thenthuk were nice . Lemon tea was awesome . The staff is friendly and warm : free wifi is available . And the lamayuru monastery view is beautiful from the rooms . Highly recommended.

ladakh,"This was our third day of our Srinagar - Leh - Ladakh tour by Road, We reached Lamayuru post lunch time. Lamayuru is a village in Leh District known for its moon-land like landscapes and Yuru Monastery. The hotel derives its name from the landscapes of Lamayuru.  We stayed one night at Hotel The Moonland Lamayuru. The hotel is multi-storeyed property with a view of the beautiful hills and located at a distance of about 500 meters from the main Srinagar-Leh highway. There is absolute no pollution around the hotel whether noise or air pollution. We reached the hotel post lunch time. There was nothing immediately available as food; because the buffet for the guests was over.

ladakh,"Very friendly owners; definitely stop in for tea and conversation (at the very least). Buffet style dinners (we did not try their food or stay with them). We stopped in for tea, apples (organic and plucked from their trees) and Internet. They have internet on demand (all the time but you may need to ask them to turn on the generator). Conversation with Sounam (questionable spelling) is very interesting as he shares how Lamayuru has changed over time.

ladakh,This hotel is located just off the kargil-Leh highway and at a walk-able distance to the monastery.  The stand-out feature of the place is an excellent garden.  The rooms are basic but clean and the overall service is good. We reached late evening and wanted a snack but the kitchen was busy with dinner service.  The owner intervened and served us some geat sandwiches.  The dinner and breakfast were also good. Overall a good exeprience,Sompan,/Profile/Sompan,"Mumbai, India",40

ladakh,The hotel was better than my expectations. I did not have high expectations from a hotel in a small place like Lamayuru. The hotel has a nice garden with a view of the surrounding hills and a small fountain. We had a budget room. Our room was decent sized but with modest amenities and no TV. The bathroom was just about ok. We found a lot of foreigners staying in this hotel. They probably had better rooms. The food was also more to suit their taste. But we liked the buffet dinner spread. The hotel boys were helpful and served with a smile. ,Soumen C,/Profile/CASoumen,"Kolkata, India",40

Staff is a friendly, jolly bunch altogether. Food was excellent, far above average for the region. And the manager arranged a guide for a hike to Wanla in no time.   During my stay there were many travellers either for trekking, breaking up long journey or visiting monestary.

They are small, but one can manage if it's only a stopover for the night. We reached Lamayuru late at night (around 9.30-10) and this too late for the village people. We checked a hotel right next to the monastery, it was stinking. Then we checked a guest house and a home stay. But there was no place and neither were they very clean. This little hotel was truly better than the rest. Clean bed sheets and blankets were provided for the extra beds as well.

It is a small hamlet straight out of a fairy tale book. And Moonland is the only hotel in this village which starts and finishes withing 3-4 mountsin bends. The hotel is mothing fancy but clean and hygienic. The food was yummy.  The staff from what I remember was not that friendly but then it didnt matter to us.

Bedrooms very simple with en suite, poorly tiled bathroom with shower, bucket shower and wc. Broken shower window with wind whistling though it made showering a very quick affair! The wc seat was badly fitted and in fact came away from the toilet. Limited hot water - time given by staff when it's available. Simple but tasty and plentiful buffet dinner.

ladakh,"There is not a lot of choice in Lamayuru, mostly very small 'homestay' type guest houses. This is also a guest house so don't expect hotel facilities, but is larger than other options. The rooms are pretty basic, but because it is elevated, there are lovely views of the village and monastery from many rooms and also from the terrace next to the dining room. As others have mentioned, there is limited electricity (evenings only) and hot water (solar). The food was as good as we had anywhere, and the dining room/terrace very pleasant. There is a lovely veg garden, and the manager was very friendly and helpful. Overall a little expensive considering the facilities, but the best option in Lamayuru.",belinda-ann,/Profile/belinda-ann,"sydney, australia",40

We pointed out that the toilet had not been cleaned for what looked like ages and that the toilet brush had just been thrown on the bathroom floor . We were then taken into the dining area for some lunch and were presented with cold rice and a mixture of not very nice vegetables . Having spent an hour at the Moonland Hotel we decided to that we would not be happy staying there and decided to move on .

The hotel rooms are simple but spotlessly clean, and the manager is a warm and friendly person who took great care of us. The food was simple and delicious, and you can enjoy your meal on the patio while looking out at the monastery perched on top of a hill ahead of you.  We were driving from Srinagar to Leh, and decided to stay overnight in Lamayuru instead of Kargil, which most people do. It was a great decision, as we got to enjoy this historic town and the hospitality at Moonland.",mangala_nanda,/Profile/mangala_nanda,"London, United Kingdom",50
