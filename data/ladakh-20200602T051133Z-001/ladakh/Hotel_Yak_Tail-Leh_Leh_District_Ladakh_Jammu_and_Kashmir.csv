Gezmo, chopstiks and Tibetan kitchen are places to try out which are near by. Would recomment and stay again next time for the location alone.

ladakh,"Stayed there for almost a week in the last week of september. Beautiful courtyard with the apple trees and the friendly poodle. Room/Washroom is comfortable, maybe slightly old, but that almost enhances the small town feel of leh.Didnt eat at the hotel, so cant comment on the food. Extremely good location. The restaurant across is the perfect place for breakfast. Couple of great restaurants just a few metres away. Nice staff, helpful & efficient. Reasonably priced.Definitely recommend it!.",Danish f,/Profile/danishfakih,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"A delightful landmark right in the middle of town. As it was cold and alot of places was shut, it was nice to be in the centre of town.  The rooms were clean and spacious and had a tv, which was welcoming when you need to acclamatise for the first few days.  The breakfast was good, and they even served it in the room.  We enjoyed sitting in the garden, which is very beautiful and peaceful. Lovely place.",Kanika77,/Profile/Kanika77,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,Eileen Hewson of Kabristan Archives loves this family hotel. Excellent value for money wonderful views from the upstairs rooms. Delightful courtyard somewhere to laze about or chat to friends. The service has remained consistently good  for 30 years Food is good and plenty of it,KabristanArchives,/Profile/KabristanArchives,"Wem, United Kingdom",30
ladakh,"It was very central and yet relatively quiet. Loved the garden, and the service was good.  Walking distance to restaurants, shops and the main bazaar and gives you access to quite a few travel agencies.  Highly recommend it!",aussiechick1977,/Profile/aussiechick1977,Perth,40
ladakh,"I stayed in two types of room, the nicer ones facing the noisy main street and also the cheaper, quieter ones round the back. I liked the more expensive rooms, except for the noise. No complaints, it was better than expected.",rawguru,/Profile/rawguru,"Expat in Madras, India",40

ladakh,"Been to this hotel in November and except for good meals, there was nothing else there; inadequate heat in the room- insufficient water not enough to even wash face or flush toilet (very cold bathroom), no electricity, no telephone, no TV and no entertainment and a cold bed to sleep in. Had to leave this place in a hurry with loss of deposit already paid for additional days! ",Journey20069,/Profile/Journey20069,"Canton, MI",10
