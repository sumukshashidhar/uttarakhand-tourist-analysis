ladakh,"We stayed in Stonehedge for two nights three days in June, 2019. Its a newly opened and well maintained property. We really liked the architecture of the hotel. it has been designed in such a way hat one gets the feeling on staying in the lap of nature. Rooms are quite spacious and beautifully done. Restaurant served exceptionally good spread of Breakfast on all days during our stay although compared to breakfast, dinner was bit let down. The hotel is very close to the Hunder valley tourist spot where double humped Camal safaris take place. The staff at the front Desk and restaurant was very pleasant and took good care of us.

ladakh,"The hotel is quite new, modern, in part obviously not completed. The room was well furnished, everything new, nothing ruined. Also the bathroom was fine and in good shape. The TV in the room did not work. The buildings of the hotel were well designed, rooms with balconies, a large terrace on the roof top. The handrail on some staircase was (still?) missing. But the restaurant was too small. And it was terribly noisy : a TV was fighting against a music player and the guests yelled, otherwise even neighbours did not understand each other. The lunch was good, the dinner acceptable, the breakfast not so good for tourist from outside india. But generally I would call it a good hotel.",Review314159,/Profile/Review314159,"Karlsruhe, Germany",40

We stayed here for two days and indeed it was a pleasant experience.The staff in the hotel are incredibly helpful and generous .The room was super spacious with all luxurious amenities which is well appreciated considering its remote location.  The views of tall stretched mountains  and the gushing sound of the stream from the balcony is a stealer. The panoramic view from the open restaurent is a WOW factor.

Despite the fact that Nubra valley had long power cuts , we still had a comfortable stay as the hotel provides power backup for sometime. It sounds odd but it did not impact our stay at all. Buffet even though had limited offerings, but was adequate and good. I found this place to be very peaceful as we did not experience any outside noise or doors banging as happens in most of the hotels.keep your phones charged if you get a signal ( only BSNL) works or you can use hotel wifi to be in touch with your family.",Navneet,/Profile/Nashthetraveller,"New Delhi, India",50

The staff is professional and attentive to your needs. Everything was smooth right from booking with Mr. Stanzin to checking-in with the hotel manager and even the restaurant staff were very friendly. Being greeted with a glass of juice and hand towels is a nice touch. The rooms are a treat - spacious, cozy, well furnitured and the ones with the mountain view offer exceptionally spectacular views. Some of the site was still under construction but it was never in the way.

Its all done up with natural stone from the surrounding mountains . The walls in the room were laid in stone , felt very relaxed here loved the balcony,  the garden , stream flowing beneath ,and the courteous staff. Breakfast had alot of fresh fruit , the food too was very good and fresh and I would like to mention Sanjeev Sharma in the restaurant  who took extra care of us. The restaurant and terrace have lovely views and they light a bonfire at night on the terrace . Definitely recommend this place for a few days stay.",Subhana G,/Profile/SubhanaG1,,50
ladakh,"What a wonderful stay it was. Although I’ve never written any review neither did I have ever complained about any previous stays, but this is really worth of my time and I would give more stars if I could. We went to Leh, Ladakh this summer and our stay in Nubra valley was booked at Stone Hedge. This place blows up my mind both in term of location and facilities. The services were extraordinary and the price was competitive. Moreover, a genuinely kindhearted native people in the service was the perfect icing on the cake. I never expected these kind of services at such remote places and the people at Stone Hedge proved me wrong.

Rooms are spacious and comfortable, all the rooms are named with the villages surrounding and sounds so good. The rooms have ethnic touch with locally available material such as Stones and Willow woods. The food quality and variety offered (local food) in the restaurant were really good.

Our room was beautiful and the view was A+ Bed was comfy and water was very hot! Staff was very attentive, food was excellent and reasonably priced. The only two minor issues we ran into were that the staff couldn't figure out how to use the safe in our room, and one of the locks on the door didn't work. The main lock worked fine though, so not a big deal.",Ray,/Profile/alafiawe,,40
ladakh,"Everything positive in other reviews I agree with, but I want to add a small point that impressed me. Stone Hedge provides free spring water in recycled glass bottles as an alternative to plastic bottled water, and it tastes cleaner and fresher than plastic bottled water, aside from the obvious environmental benefits. A plastic bottle of water could quench your thirst for an hour but the plastic will sit in the environment in Ladakh for hundreds of years, or else would be burned to pollute that clean air with carcinogenic smoke. And I don't like like drinking microplastics that are found in bottled water, so I really appreciated the clean local spring water.

The wooden architecture is simple and awesome and rooms are so tastefully and authentically done. Its a beautiful hotel, one of the best in its own simple way.
