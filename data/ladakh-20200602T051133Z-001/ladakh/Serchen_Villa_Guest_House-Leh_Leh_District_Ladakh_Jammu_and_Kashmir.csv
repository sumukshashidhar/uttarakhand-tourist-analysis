ladakh,"We had booked 3 rooms through booking.com.. When we arrived the owner said the rooms are not available coz she said she did not have Internet connection.  The booking was confirmed in july. Not only did the owner stranded us after a long 2 day journey from Manali with a senior who was suffering from AMS,  she also ridiculed us for not calling in advance and confirming the booking. Ironically,  she had Internet connection to say we were no show to booking.com the very next day.  The owner is a irresponsible,  money hungry fraud.  Plz look for other option. Also there is no food served though it is mentioned that they serve food for extra cost.  You have to walk a good 20 mins for even tea coffee ",Pavionvacation,/Profile/Pavionvacation,Bangalore,10
ladakh,"Owners did not honor booking done for 1 + 1 person, and insisted on paying additional sum, which was very unreasonable. There is only one attendant, who is a cook, a steward, a housekeeper and everything else.",Silent E,/Profile/46silente,,20
ladakh,"I travelled alone to leh for a few days, and couldn't have asked for a nicer (or safer) place to stay. The cost was unbelievable - the location : fantastic, not in the heart of town but not isolated (a 7 min walk from the centre of leh!), the owner and manager / cook were super friendly, responsible, helpful and unintrusive. The room and bathroom were incredibly clean (and even had a tv!) (Had the best gobi parantha of my life!)   I can't wait to go back. ",Shriya M,/Profile/418shriyam,,50
ladakh,"I arrived abit late in the evening at this guest house. Room were ok. Food was also fine. location wise also it is good enough.  Overall good for one night. Most of the rooms (with attached bath) are in the new building, though there are a few simpler rooms in the original house. The property is large, with a nice gardenThere are good mountain views. Wifi is free.",Angelina M,/Profile/AngelinaM775,"Toronto, Canada",40
