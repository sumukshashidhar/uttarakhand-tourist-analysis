ladakh,We had a very comfortable stay here. Manoj the care taker and cook prepared very delicious food and was polite in his behaviour. We had not booked in advance and relied on our driver Sonam's advice. The sand dunes for camel rides are quite near from here. Due to the unpredictable electricity there was no hot water during the day. Rooms and bathrooms were clean and the dining hall was also spacious and clean. The rates were inclusive of breakfast and dinner - within our moderate budget. No wifi as no signals. View was fantastic. Beautiful garden outside the guest house.,chetana306,/Profile/chetana306,"Mumbai, India",40

The rooms were clean and offered great views from the room. Its a budget stay rooms but excellent in its category.",Bhautik M,/Profile/bhautikm2014,,40
ladakh,"Durante il nostro viaggio di 15 giorni in Ladakh, abbiamo trascorso una notte in questa Guesthouse della Nubra Valley. Il posto dove è situata è molto bello e tranquillo, ma tutto il resto lascia a desiderare (anche per gli standing di queste zone!) dalla pulizia alla cordialità. Arrivi qualcuno ti fa vedere la camera, mangi, parti e non hai capito chi gestisce questa struttura e la pulizia .... il bagno inguardabile! Comunque quello che ci è successo dopo cena per me ha dell' incredibile, anche per l'India. Premetto che noi mangiamo sempre con la nostra guida e autista. Dunque alla fine della cena (per altro nemmeno troppo buona) e prima di prendere il tè, ci invitano a lasciare la sala da pranzo e ad andare a prendere il tè in giardino, perché un gruppo di5/6 uomini indiani",Flavia M,/Profile/flaviam483,"Locarno, Switzerland",20
ladakh,It is a blessing we found this guesthouse. Because of  a mix-up in our accommodation booking for Double Humped Camp and the camp was closed for the season.  We found this nice bungalow guesthouse set within a lovely garden and birch trees.  It is located near to the Mani wheel bridge.   The guesthouse is newly opened in July this year.  We took  up all  the five twin rooms with attached bathroom.  All rooms are carpeted.  The bathroom is big and clean with cold running water.  Hot water bath is available in the morning  prearranged between 6.30am to 10am.   We noticed that the 2nd level is in the process of building.  The owner Mr T Phuntsog  and his wife were both humble and soft spoken. They were good cook.  Our dinner were delicious cooked with plenty of vegetables direct,Dinah L,/Profile/wun,Malaysia,40
