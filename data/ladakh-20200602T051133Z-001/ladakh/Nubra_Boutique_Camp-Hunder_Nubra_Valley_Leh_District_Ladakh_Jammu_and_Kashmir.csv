ladakh,Pleased with the services and tent. Remotely located in the valley but is a wonderful site. Good food and good service. The staff was very cooperative. Suggest to reach the place before dusk as it can get a bit creepy reaching the site in low light. The property seems to be new and is well maintained.,funduashish,/Profile/funduashish,"Pune, India",50
ladakh,"Located a bit inside from the main road, the Nubra Boutique Camp is a bit difficult to locate. The property is however is well maintained and amidst nature. The beds and bathrooms are clean. They serve breakfast and dinner which is quite good and is vegetarian. The staff was courteous. The hot water supply was for one hour only in the morning hours from 7 AM and one has to plan accordingly.",Nlay,/Profile/vagabond_lay,"Durgapur, India",40

ladakh,"The Nubra Boutique Camp is the newest option in Hundar, just opened in June 2017 and I was one of their first guest. Everything was perfect and new. Large tents with plenty of space and a nice veranda overlooking the mountains. Top quality matresses and fine bed sheets and towel. Really a boutique accomodation. On top of this, the quality of food was also really good, served in the confortable dining room. Silver Sand dunes can be reached in 15 minutes with a nice walk through the local village.  Definitely the place to stay in Nubra Valley. I strongly recommend Nubra Buotique Camp also to support the team ol local people managing the Camp.",aquila65Italia,/Profile/aquila65Italia,italia,50
