ladakh,"We stayed 3 nights at this resort.  Rooms are well appointed, but small. If you have a lot of luggage, it gets cramped. Food and service are good,Wifi lousy  and there was a problem with the hot water for showers, which meant “Indian showers” with buckets and this for INR 6,500 per night!! Even so the place was empty, the owner was not prepared to lower the price. The only reason they get away with this high rate is, that there is a shortage of accommodation in beautiful Sakti. Definitely NOT value for money!!..",zauberberg,/Profile/zauberberg,"Melbourne, Australia",30
ladakh,"The Fana Resort is strategically located in a quaint location off the Manali - Leh Highway in a traditional Ladakhi village Sakti. The village is very scenic and one can stroll around this resort and find a great relaxing environment here. In fact once can decide to stay here instead of Leh as its well connected and also do Pangong lake as a day trip.  The manager and the owner are very friendly and you feel at home with their personal touch. The food ! , they cook it very well. If you are a health conscious person , you will appreciate the choice of the food served.  One can read, do archery in the large garden area , walk to the water spring in the back yard.  Its a great place. As a indian living in a metro city , would also recommend to consider it a place as  great escape. ",FrenchHaveli,/Profile/FrenchHaveli,"Jaipur, India",50
