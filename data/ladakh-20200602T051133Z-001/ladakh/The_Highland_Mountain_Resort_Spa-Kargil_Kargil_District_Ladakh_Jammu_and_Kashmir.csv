The hotel has 4 rooms with queen/double beds but they purposely provided us twin bed rooms and sold our preferred rooms for a premium. Later, the management tells us to take whatever available or leave the hotel. The management also blamed the tour guy falsely that they had made special request for separate twin beds for the couples.

Food is basic, not much choices but filling.  Wi-Fi is available at the lobby but it is rather unstable.   The manager is very nice and I was upgraded to a suite on the return trip. The suite room is huge and would have been very suitable for a family.    Strange part is that the property is right next to the river but there are no rooms with views of the river.

The rooms are well-appointed and spacious, with some of them overlooking the sprawling lawn and the colorful fountain.   It is located just a little away from the main Kargil bazaar and bus stand, on the banks of the river Suru. But do not be put off by the fact that the surrounding area might be noisy because of its proximity to the bazaar. Just experience the quietude and calmness inside. To indulge in such luxury in a relatively small city like Kargil is quite surprising.

However, based on very favourable customer reviews on Tripadvisor, we requested our Tour Operator to book a suite at the Highland Mountain Resort. THIS WAS A BIG MISTAKE.

The Srinagar Leh highway is excellent so the ride is smooth, but it was a long journey. The roads in Zangskar on the other hand are very rough and bumpy, so it's important you stay in a good resort where you can get a running hot shower, and a comfortable room, with good food.
