A home away from home where everything and everybody feel your own.the staff and Stanzin the owner are lovely and make sure that you get the best,they make your stay comfortable.

ladakh,"Traveling to ladaki in winters was always on the charts but a shot of uncertainty aways loomed through the planing. Our stay at jheartjh made us feel at home, like we were visiting friends.    Most of the town was shut,and it felt like visiting a hidden heritage of a lost himalayan community. Thanks to Mr. Sharma, Stanzin, oscar and pali. See you guys soon.",ravikant528,/Profile/ravikant528,,50

ladakh,"This is one of the best hostel experiences I have had in a long time, they made my first trip to Ladakh quite memorable. Located 7 mins from the main market (walking distance) This is a perfect place to indulge in some self-exploration. Lovely hostel mates and lovely staff.",Freedom54952488570,/Profile/Freedom54952488570,,50
ladakh,"Hearth ‚Äì A home away from home. A perfect, cozy hostel in Leh. Often when we travel to a new place we always book hotel rooms, visit the most commercial or touristy spots and then go home. This is where Hearth Hostel is different. Here, you enter a home which is converted in to a hostel, be greeted by the most warm and gracious hosts, go to your alloted room /dormitory with the beautifully made wooden bunk beds, comfortable mattresses and quilts! I usually find it difficult to sleep on a new bed/mattress when I am travelling but Hearth‚Äôs mattresses and quilt wrapped me warmly and led me to effortless sleep.  When it came to exploring the place, hosts who are localites suggested commercial as well as non-commercial point, a blend of both made the whole experience worthwhile.

ladakh,"My first review and I could not be happier to write one for 'The Hearth'. I landed there with a broken hand and unsure of how I would eventually manage my time in Leh. But with Stenzin, Poornima and Bunty Bhai, it was like coming home. These guys are always available never more than a call or 5 minutes away. Plus they will go out of their way to help you with your plans and suggest alternatives.   My room was absolutely clean and the bed so comfortable, that I did not really want to step out, which is a bummer considering I was in Leh.   The garden and the common area lift your mood any time of the day. And one can see snow peaked caps from the rooms. Also one ends up meeting a bazillion people in the common area and a gazillion stories are exchanged.   All in all 'The Hearth'",LoveTravel818093,/Profile/LoveTravel818093,,50
ladakh,"This is the only review I have left during my stay during India. I have never before felt so compelled to do so! Hearth hostel was friendly, clean, welcoming and enjoyable. It's location is perfect and its staff are extremely helpful.  I felt more like a friend to the owners than a client! The beds are insanely comfy (from what ive heard quite hard to find in Leh) and the views of the Himalayas from the rooms are stunning. I ended up staying for just over a week because I could not leave.  Honestly, if you stay in Ladakh, stay here.",tvickery2018,/Profile/tvickery2018,"Stroud, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"the staff has been absolutely nice and flexible, so that my staying has been as easy and comfortable as being at home. Very nice evening initiatives (movies projection, small concerts, games) allow to have a real and unique ladakhi experience. Rooms are spartans but very well equipped... all the furniture is hand made in real wood! Breakfasts and meals are totally homemade prepared...and having them in the central garden, under the apricot tree, has no price! absolutely recommended!",Flavio F,/Profile/851flaviof,"Barcelona, Spain",50
ladakh,"By far my most enjoyable stay in northern india. Great community vibes, generous owners that truly care, access to in-house travel agency services, perfect location in the old Leh market (less tourists), walking distance from the new market, old palace and Tsemo monastery. A little haven of peace‚Äìplus there's an apricot tree.",nathansgiroux,/Profile/nathansgiroux,"Montreal, Canada",50
ladakh,It‚Äôs a great stay for my guests. The old house has a nice Tibet vibe  They also give community kitchen ya can use for very cheap. The location is amazingly right in town but you don‚Äôt feel like you are in the city centre,stanzin g,/Profile/662stanzing,"Leh, India",50
ladakh,I would recommend this hostel to everybody who is visiting Leh. The place is being run by really warm welcoming passionate people. They have also curated a couple of experiences which ensures your good time in Leh.,Pushkar B,/Profile/703pushkarb,,50
ladakh,"I cannot say enough good things about Hearth hostel. The decor is tasteful yet comfortable and makes it feel instantly like a home away from home. Purnima and Stanzin have created a little oasis in the middle of Leh that is peaceful, sociable and a lot of fun. With plans for more music and film evenings, this place has a wonderful vibe and its own feeling of community. A big thank you to all of the lovely staff and the big dogs for making us feel like part of the family, we shall see you in three years!",Flora F,/Profile/FloraF411,,50
ladakh,It was great tour we had a very warm and lovely stay at Hearth and even the staff were so humble and cooperative we felt like home away from home. Hats off to stanzin and his team will surely visit again and stay there,Devashish D,/Profile/devashishd2018,"Navi Mumbai, India",50
