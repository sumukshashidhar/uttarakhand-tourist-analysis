ladakh,Best hostel I've been to. First day in leh is rough but afterwards it's so great. It is far away from the main bazaar but public busses and taxis are abundant. Rupanker is an awesome dude and I will definitely come back. ,Rotem O,/Profile/rotemo340,,50

ladakh,"It was our first trip to Ladakh and we were having lot of expectations alongwith many apprehensions in terms of high altitude issues etc. over there. No matter we booked our flights long back, the booking of the hotel was a last minute decision but definitely it turned to be our best decision for the trip.The first moment I looked at the building of the hotel from the outside, with a traveler picture painted on a huge wall, immediately I got this connection with the place. As I entered the premises, the lobby area is one of the most creative places in the hotel. As we went around, we felt that the paintings on other walls speaks the love of the owners of the hotel for Ladakh and for travelling. The Hotel is a new property, very clean, very pocket friendly and throughout our",Akhilesh,/Profile/akhileshsrivastava,,50

ladakh,"For us the trip was without any planning,got to know about Happy Drifters through a mutual friend and without even knowing how the place was going to be, we just arrived there. As we took off from the main road into an unpaved one, we got a little anxious only to find ourselves surprised by the cool welcome at Happy Drifters. The place is pretty nice, clean and well maintained. The graffiti on the walls gives you the feel of a seasoned traveler( even if you aren't :)) The staff along with owner duo ( Jafar & Rupankar) are quite cordial and fun to be around. For a group like us who wanted the trip to be hassle free, Happy Drifters superbly ensured that it turns into a seamless one. Everything and everywhere we wanted to go was flawlessly arranged by Happy Drifters including",Safari819588,/Profile/Safari819588,,50

ladakh,"As I entered the lane where the traveler‚Äôs home is located, a little uncertainty took over me, as the lane was an unpaved one. But just like the saying goes, don‚Äôt judge a book by its cover, the home, too, looks quite deceptive from outside. As one nears the home, you can see a huge wall art of a traveler with hills and mountains in the backdrop, looming over, beckoning you to explore Ladakh and its snow-clad mountains. Once inside the premises, you can see the home exploding with vibrant arts, the walls painted in various activities depicting the heart of Ladakh, its people, and its culture. With a friendly working staff and pleasant ambience, you are bound to feel at home here.

ladakh,"""Julley"" (Welcome)  Ladakh is still a less chosen travel destination for many. It's a choice usually made in the prime of youth and those who seek adventures more than an easy hotel stay. When you travel to a place that is physically exhausting, you crave to come back to a place where you can have a good night's sleep so that you can take on the next day's adventures with zeal and renewed vigour.  Happy Drifters (about 1.5kms from the Leh airport) has exactly that to offer - a snug sleep, amicable staff, homely food and lots of sunshine and breeze. It's one of those places where you can simply spend the day by snuggling in with your spouse and watch TV or spend an afternoon talking idly with your group of friends as you listen to the echoes of the mountains. And as harsh summer",SushmitaLahkar,/Profile/SushmitaLahkar,"Guwahati, India",50
