ladakh,"Very nice one, we should appreciate the way they have set up the tent in such a remote place. Coffee was awesome and food was tasty. Service was also too good. Owner was so obedient and ready to serve at any time. We were very happy with Highland Camp.  Food - Very Good.  Tent - Very Nice, Only toilet portion they can maintain little more cleaner.  Wi-Fi - Not there.(Not expecting in that region)  Highly recommend this.",vishnumoorthi b,/Profile/vishnumoorthi,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,"We reached the place at approx. 6pm. The location is exactly opposite Pangong Lake. The Bed and the washroom is pathetic. Being the tent it just doesnt help at all against the cold wind outside.For whatever needed, you have to shout for the person, as coming of tent is like walking on ICE. The hospitality of the people is awesome. The place can have a little more facilities with good washroom and Bed. Rest place is OK.",shs07,/Profile/shs07,"Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,"I visited Pangong TSO in the month of May. The location of the camp is just beside the beautiful lake. Water was not there as the pipe got busted due to cold weather. Every time you have to ask for the water and the staff will bring water from the lake with ice. Beds are not comfortable and so will affect the  sleep quality. The scene outside the lake is awesome, specially in the morning time. It is a value for money but not quite comfortable. You can see for some other options.",Ritwik P,/Profile/RitwikP,"Muzaffarpur, India",30
