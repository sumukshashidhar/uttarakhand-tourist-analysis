ladakh,Rooms were clean and spacious. The owners are lovely people. There was running hot water in our bathrooms. They have a beautiful garden and ample of places to sit and admire the view. Will be glad if they can include some local food in breakfast and dinner that they serve but overall all i would like to say is thanks to them.,Priyanka Y,/Profile/570priyankay,"Pune, India",40
ladakh,"We stayed at Galaxy guest house in October. The place is a small one tucked away in Nubra valley small distance away from Hundar sand dunes. Rooms were ok. However, there was no hot water, no basic amenities in the cold weather. The worst experience was that the owner started accusing  us of changing the WIFI password when we were leaving next day early morning, when most of us had complained about it not working. This was completely unacceptable, and the worst part was owner shouting us to ""Get Lost"" when we were leaving.   If trip advisor had a no star rating, would have given that. Completely unacceptable for a hotel to continue in this manner with ridiculous customer centricity!!",Shaunak C,/Profile/shaunakc1984,,10

ladakh,People there.. home cooked food.. location and rooms.. all are 10 on rate card. Nothing to doubt about.. of course it's a guest house but very well maintained. Owners are too good and helpful. Also.. must visit turtuk will possible.. they suggested us this place and I m telling it's worth spending every second there in that village. ,Jitender K,/Profile/128jitenderk,,50
ladakh,"This is a nice little home stay type of guest house located in Hunder. As it is someone's home, it is nicely maintained. Very clean place. The home owners/caretakers were some of the nicest people we met on our trip. They took very good care of us with a regular supply of ginger lemon tea, coffee, etc. I was unwell in Nubra, running a high fever. They were really helpful. The food was mouthwatering to say the least. Very simple yet as delicious as delicious can be. Most of the vegetables were grown by them in their own vegetable garden. We were touched by their simplicity and hospitality. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Nubra Valley",Kartik I,/Profile/KartikI26,,50

ladakh,"We went to this place as another place we were interested in was booked and had heard a recommendation from another traveler earlier in the day. How we wished we had looked for a different place; Hunder after all has numerous guest houses. It is a fairly long ride through stone filled roads to get to this place. It is much more interior when compared to many other guest houses that are closer to the paved road. At the outset the place has a nice garden with apple trees and pretty flowers. The room was small and cramped with little space to place our luggage. There is no TV in the room. The bathroom was in bad shape with broken fittings and no space to keep any clothes inside.

ladakh,"Stayed in Galaxy guest house because our first two preferences (Habib and Yourdum) weren't available. The guest house was completely empty. After negotiating the price, we thought we got a good deal. Booked two rooms. The rooms and the washroom were neat and clean. There was no hot running water but they gave us hot water in buckets. We has no phone network, so the owner offered his phone to make a call. The cook prepared a fantastic dinner for us. Everything looked great about the guesthouse before going to bed.  Got up in the morning, got ready and wanted to order the breakfast. We had only two options: bread or parathas (that too only aaloo). Opted for paratha. After 15-20 mins we were told that our breakfast was ready. There were only four parathas in the casserole (one per",MaheshThipse,/Profile/MaheshThipse,"Pune, Maharashtra, India",20

The rooms though a bit small, are warm and comfortable and toilets and clean and special. Understand that while in Nubra valley, you will be needing a hotel/guest house just to crash in at night. Galaxy guest house offer a comfortable bed and a good bathroom with running hot and cold water 24x7. The electricity is on during night only from 7 pm to 5 am so make sure you charge your mobiles and camera batteries at night.  The food is basic but good.

We were trapped in a village due to landslides for 2 days before we finally reached Galaxy Guest House.  After a bad bad experience due to natural calamity, what we needed the most was home and family. Galaxy guest house was the perfect home and the family that manages the hotel made us a part of their family.   Mr. Stanzin & Mr. Rinchen welcomed us with great warmth even though we reached at 9pm. We had reached 2 days late as per our scheduled date and without any hesitation, they accommodated us. Within 30 minutes, they made the extremely delicious and satisfying dinner.

Very comfortable stay, good clean rooms with hot water and lovely home made food made all the difference to our stay.

Given the number of options at Nubra, we would definitely recommend Galaxy guest house without a second thought as it is really nominally priced given the comfort and homely stay.

ladakh,The Galaxy guest house is located in Hunder village which is right next to the sand dunes of Nubra. Its a nice home stay with an elderly ladhaki couple looking after you. The rooms are cozi and have comfortable beds. The lighting in our room was a little though. The washrooms are very hygienic. The food is a bit of a let down but I dont think in the village there are any better options. Do have the ladhaki local bread for breakfast.,Sorashtra,/Profile/Sorashtra,"Mumbai, India",30

When I went there in july 2013 along with my husband, we were the only people there but trust me, I found it secure enough and comfortable.As far as its location is concerned I don't think it should not  be an issue once u r travelling in a place like Ladakh where every thing is scenic.

Pros : - Nice clean rooms - 24 * 7 hot water - Too too too yummy food.  - Very helping staff - Apple and apricot trees in their farm.  Cons : - If you are traveling in couple, this may not be a ideal place for privacy. Because it is a property more like a bunglow then like a hotel.  - Silly con is, we were 13 of us but were only given 4 towels :) - They had unnecessarily charged us for room service whereas we didn't demanded for any service.

ladakh,"Galaxy Guest house  It is a big mistake on the part of the tourist to book hotel accommodation in advance anywhere in Ladakh. The rates are exorbitant and makes the budget traveller think twice. Most of the accommodation in Nubra are in the towns of Diskit and Hunder. They consist of Tent encampments or guest houses. There are a few in Diskit but the majority of them are in Hunder.  On entering Hunder you head towards the Sand dunes. Down the road you come to a T junction. The road on the right takes you to the sand dunes. The one on the left to all the camps and Guest houses.  Most of the Tent camps are very basic and if you like to rough it out, it is an experience.
