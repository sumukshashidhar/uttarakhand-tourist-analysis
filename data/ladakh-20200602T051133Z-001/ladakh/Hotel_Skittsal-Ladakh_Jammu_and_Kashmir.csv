ladakh,"Do not let the beautiful setting confuse you, this hotel has very poor standard. Their restaurant takes two hours to prepare the food, and my son had the worst food poisoning from the dish he had there. As for the hotel... The room and bathroom were not very clean and no toilet paper. The price they quoted was double what I had seen on the internet and matched only when I showed them the browser. There was zero hot water (meaning nothing came out of the hot water tap) and then they said no hot water in the evening, only at seven but it actually only came on at 9:30am as we were leaving the room. Do not stay here is my recommendation.",Nene M,/Profile/NeneM961,,20
ladakh,"We wanted to stay in a village, hence opted this.. Terrible rooms, we had to upgrade to the best tier room (paid extra for this) as the normal room was horrible.. All rooms had a smell.. ordinary on food.. though the staff was friendly and helpful.. and the location n views from here are just wonderful.. You must stay here if not too fussy with rooms upkeep..",Wanderlust_SM,/Profile/Wanderlust_SM,"Singapore, Singapore",20
ladakh,We were 4 of us and we were on a serious adventure trip. We decided to stay in skitsal which is 18 kms away from Leh @ Stok village. Our instant reaction was amazing. Really beautiful place and homely. Loved the people there ( they were just 4). we knew very few of them shall choose this place to stay and only 30% occupancy were there. The manager was very nice and gentle and gave us our own customized menu. The food was of 1st quality. The best is there were no TV's views were breathtaking. Rooms were very nice and clean with basic amenities. hot water was a problem but the service was so good that they got us hot water anytime. we came back from Pangong and stayed an another day. 2 thumbs up for their hospitality and service.  A Gem within a Gem in leh. Strongly recommend for,Varun V,/Profile/VarunV766,"Chennai, India",40
ladakh,"We spent one night in Hotel Skittsal (meaning place of happiness)  in the midst of hotelhopping around J&K and found a hotel with an inspired view. The hotel is in the village of Stok and stands alone in a valley with miles of bare land around.  The room given to us had a dressing room with the bathroom beyond it. Hot water was availabe only in th emorning from 6 to 10am but you could request at other times A terrace ran around the side of the building and afforded a breathtaking view of the Stok village nestled among the Stok range. The restaurant served nourishing portions of wholesome though basic fare.The staff was at a minimum as we visited before the season started full swing but the manager and the others were extremely helpful, courteous and friendly. The place is a must",arbitraryconstt,/Profile/arbitraryconstt,Mumbai,40
ladakh,"Hotel Skittsal, Stok/Ladakh Visit: July/August 2005 Recommended by a visitor to the TripAdisor website If you want to escape the crowded and noisy city of Leh - especially in July and August - you will find a peaceful place in Stok, a little village 14 km away from Leh and not far from the Royal Stok Palace. Hotel Skittsal gives you all what you expect from a relaxing stay in Ladakh: beautiful surroundings, the most spectacular view on Indus Valley and the surroundig mountains, a building in the traditional Ladakhi style and a friendly staff. We have been visiting this hotel for the past 4 years in a row and always felt like coming home. ",Tourist13435,/Profile/Tourist13435,Neuried/Germany,40
