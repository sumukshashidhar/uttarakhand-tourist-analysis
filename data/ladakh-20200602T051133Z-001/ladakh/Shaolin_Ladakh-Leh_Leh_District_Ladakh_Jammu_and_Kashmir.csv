ladakh,"Shaolin is a wonderful hotel run by a local Ladakhi family. Our stay here, was made memorable by their hospitality. Since we visited Leh without making any plans, Tani, the youngest member of the family and who usually runs the place was kind enough to provide us with all the information about the Ladakh region and also connected us to a bikers group.  The rooms and toilets are clean and offer an  amazing distant view of the Tsemo monastery. Also, there is an outdoor garden, where you can sit, relax and also have a bonfire on chilly evenings.

ladakh,We’re a young couple from the UK travelling India. We stayed at the Shaolin Guest House for 4 nights in July.   It’s a special place with a great atmosphere which is down to the family which run the Guest House. We felt at home here as soon as we arrived - the family (especially Danny and the boys) could not have been more attentive and welcoming.   The rooms are comfortable and clean. The beds have proper duvets. The grounds of the hotel are relaxing - our favourite part was our morning coffee in the garden.  The walk into Leh was fine for us - we didn’t need a taxi as only took 15 minutes. It was a nice chance to stretch our legs!   We ate at the hotel on three nights - the food was prepared by the boys and was good.

ladakh,Stayed here for 3 nights. Kindly note that this is a guest house kind of accommodation and not a Hotel!  Being a guest house the service is very limited like breakfast and dinner is only served if you have made the booking or have informed them in advance. You cannot get anything to eat/drink in between as their kitchen remains closed apart from those time. Rooms are good and spacious. Overall a good place to just sleep overnight. The owner takes care of all travelling and is co-operative but in case he is busy/un-available then the caretakers (2 guys who cook and also takes care of room cleaning) are not very interested to work apart from their routine Job.Most of the time they are busy listening to music and dancing inside the kitchen!!

The owner and the workers are really nice.  It's just one thing that brought me down, it is the distance. It is located around 15-20 min walking distance to the Main Bazaar. Frankly speaking, 15-20 min is actually not too far but... since the road is uphill, i can't help but to feel exhausted and out of breath everytime i want to go back to my homestay.

We had booked online and they had given the room to someone without us cancelling or making any mods. This led to a confusion when we arrived and obviously we were angry.  However, they requested us to give and hour in which they shifted the other guests to a different hotel and cleaned the room for us, which I was ok with as we had 2 other rooms to freshen up.  For the mistake they did the owner gave us a free dinner treat as compensation without us asking which was a nice gesture.  The rooms were spacious and balcony was decently big and clean.

Ladakh is a great place to visit, but things can turn out to be different from the expected and because of weather conditions there may be change in itinerary etc. It is much better to stay with someone who is accommodative and can help you like a family member.   Though the guest house has lean staff, they have amongst the best and positive staff you can ever find (Angmo, Sanju, Babloo). Food is the most homely and tasty I had anywhere in Leh.

The rooms were spacious and clean. And everybody made us feel comfortable and welcome! It is situated away from the clamor of the main market, yet near enough that you can stroll down to the market while soaking in the amazing scenery around. Special thanks to Grandma for the wonderful lunch & dinner! And to Dharmender for managing everything in his cheerful way. The owners were super helpful and even allowed us to keep our luggage with them, while we traveled ahead on a bike. Definitely recommend it.

ladakh,We absolutely enjoyed our stay at Shaolin Guest House.  It's great to experience and introduction of Ladakhi  lifestyle in Leh.  It is about 20 mins walk to town.  A bit long but the footpaths make it an enjoyable walk.  The hosts were very helpful and do order Ladakhi bread for breakfast!

Great veggie garden which you can taste in the cooking. And two wonderful hosts who make you feel right at home. Plus if you bring some ground coffee, they've got a nice Italian espresso maker.",heyhojimjo,/Profile/heyhojimjo,"New Delhi, India",50

The hospitality of Mr Dorje family is simply unforgettable. There's a lot being already said about the food & rooms, so i won't add much.  We booked 3 economic rooms earlier from agoda for the date of our arrival at leh but unfortunalety one of friend's could't join us for the trip. Mr. Dorje as gesture of gratitude upgraded our rooms to deluxe at no extra cost as they were vacant & for the remaining 1 room he said he would adjust the money against the stay made by us in the upcoming  days.

This property is 20 mins walking from the Leh city center. But don't worry you will enjoy walking .TIP - Always carry a torch in night.  Once we arrived at the Shaoline guest house, we were very impressed and amazed by the beautiful garden which was organic garden. Guest house looks great than its photos.  Rooms are very good, Clean, fresh, and tidy. Towels sheets and blankets are neat and clean.  They also have laundry facility which is plus.  Phuntsog ji is the owner of the property.

However since they were over-booked, they instead confirmed our stay in Shaolin Extension run by Sonam and Padma. Initially we were apprehensive, but  on hindsight our stay in Shaolin extension made our Ladakh Holiday so special.  About Shaolin Extension: It is run by Sonam and Padma, while Suraj will be your man-friday...practically you can rely on him for everything. Clean sheets, clean toilet, hot water, awesome food practically everything that you can expect in a star rated hotel. Just that you also get the warm hospitality that you can never expect anywhere. Sonam specially goes out of his way to make your stay in Leh comfortable.  So will I recommend Shaolin Ext? Hell yes,",SSarmah,/Profile/SSarmah,"Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India",50

But what makes it different is the care and attention provided by Phuntsog and family. The food is cooked from the fresh vegetables from the garden itself. It is around 1 km from the main market of Leh which gives it a serene atmosphere. I shall surely recommend it to everyone",ravi_bansal,/Profile/ravi_bansal,"Hyderabad, India",50

The owner were very kind to arrange a pick up cab from Airport to their guest house & they helped us in moving to the another guest house, as we had 2 days booking with them. Food was cooked from home made vegetables, so don't expect any fancy items and most important television.

They were extremely polite and cooperative which was a great help on the first day on landing in Leh with all the strain the body goes through as part of normal acclimatization.  The rooms are neat. There is no restaurant, though there's a dining hall where one gets home made food. Choice is limited but food is simple and tasty.  Wifi is available in the dining hall but not in rooms.

I had a corner room with two double beds, two armchairs, a coffee table, and a view of snow-capped Himalayan mountains. I spent many mornings enjoying the sun with a paperback book and hot milk tea. Cars rarely disturbed the silence, and even a random cow's mooing was louder. The attached bathroom was spacious and up to standard -- there were clean towels, a reliable toilet, and plenty of hot water for the shower and sink.  You can add a home-cooked breakfast (150 INR) and dinner (200 INR) every day. My typical breakfast was an egg omelette with cheese, vegetable soup, toast, and tea.

I had taken a simple single occupancy room which fit my budget. The room was simple, clean and homely. The family is just awesome - Abile is almost always pleasant and she'd come offering chulis and kushis, so are the kids and Dharmender - who is constant entertainment and a huge, huge help.

ladakh,This place is exactly one of those places you want to stay at just because it has all the things you are possibly looking for when you decided to come to Leh in the first place:  1. A gorgeous view of the snow-capped mountains? Check.  - Do go for the rooms facing the front courtyard. The guest house only has 2 of these rooms.  - They are spacious and worth the extra bit of money.  2. Friendly hosts? Check.  - Our hosts were really great. They made sure that we were okay.   - Two of us were down with AMS the whole 2 nights we were there and they were happy to share with us their lunch (at a minimal price) eventhough it was not part of the package.)  - The grandmother was exceptionally adorable and generous with her smiles!  3.

Phuntsog the owner and his family gave us sufficient privacy whilst making sure we had everything we needed.  They cooked us meals with ingredients from their organic farm.
