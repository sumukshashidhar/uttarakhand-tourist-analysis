ladakh,"while coming back from Leh, we stayed there for a night, just to get by types in night. Its quite and nice although there is no kitchen in this, its only for stays.... we brought our dinner from the main market and there are quite good restaurants in kargil as well.... for reaching there you need to cross the main market and ask for dak banglow and you will reach there easily.... for getting food you need to come back to market by your vehicle only....",survivor977,/Profile/survivor977,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
ladakh,"Escape the crowds, pollution and noise here in this quiet hotel, tucked away above town, near the government hotel. After hours and hours in a taxi from Srinagar, we really enjoyed the peace and quiet -- well worth the walk up the hill. We had two nights in Kargil, first in an expensive hotel in the middle of town, with constant noise from other guests, and thankfully Royal Guest House the second night, blissfull.",DanskeDina,/Profile/DanskeDina,,40
