ladakh,I stayed here during my solo trip in winters. Budget accommodation but I was taken care of like a family. Very tasty home cooked food. They also help with transportation and have WiFi though it's patchy as it's govt provided. Contact 9654244102 for bookings ,BunnyPunia,/Profile/BunnyPunia,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"The guesthouse is situated in a very beautiful location, surrounded by high mountains, has a garden of its own. Rooms are comfy and spacious. Home cooked food, tastes great. We did not face any issue during our stay (except no geyser in bathroom). Owner family is very polite and welcomes you.",Ankul G,/Profile/AnkulG,"Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India",50
ladakh,We stayed here for one night in a group.  They have double rooms and one room of 3.  Reasonably priced and clean. The beds were so comfy and the bathroom was spacious.  It was 200 rupees for supper and it was one of the nicest meals I had in India. The curry was homemade and not lathered in oil - so good!  The family are very lovely too!! Unreal sunset view from the rooftop.  It was a pleasant stay all in all! ,FreyaDH,/Profile/FreyaDH,"Bruton, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,The guest house is situated at very remote place of Hunder but newly built and provide all facilities and luxurious bathroom and ladakhi style common dining room. This also has its own kitchen garden and has all around mountain view.,KeshavChakraborty,/Profile/KeshavChakraborty,"Pune, India",40
ladakh,We stayed in this property when we visited to Numbra Valley. The property is situated in Hunder Village. The staff was very courteous and helpful. The food was delicious. The sand dunes in Numbra Valley and the Double humped camel riding  spot are just 5 minutes drive from the guesthouse. The rooms were comfortable enough to make you feel cosy during night when the temperature drops almost near 0.  The electricity is available from 6:30PM-11:00PM so make sure you charge up your camera/laptop/mobile. Since there is no electricity after 11:00PM do ask for an LED light since itâ€™s too dark at night and it will further help you incase if you get up at night. ,Akash_Topdar,/Profile/Akash_Topdar,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"Excellent quality of rooms; very clean room and bathroom. It is a very comfortable place to stay. Food is reasonably good.  Staff there (Sharma) is extremely polite and helpful. Just a tip, do always check the rates of all his services in advance. We got looted for the Beer we ordered from him; paid some 7 times the cost of the can.",Arunkumar R,/Profile/ArunkumarR,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,Best things- - Beautiful property - In the middle of hills - There is a terrace to view the amazing night sky (see pics) - courteous and polite staff - Continuous sound of the stream flowing nearby - They pluck veggies from their own farm which is in their premises and cook for you. Food as a result was really really tasty (as is the case with all of Ladakh) - Rooms are average but decent  - VALUE FOR MONEY....   Things not so good - Not luxury type if you are looking for one   Overall- Opinions differ from person to person.... my overall experience was SERENE....,Suman S,/Profile/sumansinha84,,40
ladakh,"Made the reservation two weeks in advance. The lady is really kind n courteous on the phone. We were scheduled to arrive on 5th July evening.. however the markings on boards isn't the best and it took us a good while to find them.once there however it was good to see the good parking and big garden.. rooms are huge and cosy but electricity goes at 11. The current cook was there from Jammu but was not equipped to answer our questions correctly when it came to knowing the route ahead next day. Also, he charged us extra for 2 paranthas that we ate Inspite of room tariff including dinner n breakfast. Small amount but feels weird paying extra for extra paranthas as they are limited to 2 per person. Never seen this happen anywhere. Apart from this, we had a great stay :-) ",BunnyPunia,/Profile/BunnyPunia,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"A beautiful place, nice and very warm people. They serve dinner and breakfast and it is very good. It is located in a very beautiful place with amazing landscape. Its located a little interior and with a very calm surroundings with fresh water stream flowing next to the house. Make sure you walk around in the mornings to see all birds and experience the beautiful weather.",Guru V,/Profile/GuruV16,,40
ladakh,"We stayed in the guest house for one night. The location is very good, not very far from the sand dunes. The rooms are spacious with large windows, and the atmosphere is peaceful. The hosts are nice people, they served us Thukpa for dinner which tasted awesome. They had guests come over on the day we visited and so we could meet a lot of kids playing outside the house. They also served us butter tea on request.  They have a garden where they grow some veggies and the scenery was beautiful. I would recommend this place for a homely stay at Hunder.",Arun DK,/Profile/dkarun,Hyderabad,50
ladakh,"Budget Guest House with Basic Amenities located in a scenic beauty place in Hunder.... Very Generous Lady who manage the Guest House.Received excellent service....Spacious Room , Hot Running Water, beautiful Garden and apples trees all around..Highly recommended in Hunder..",DjAssam,,"Guwahati, India",50
ladakh,"We had planned two nights stay in Hunder but this GH was full on the day we reached there so we stayed in another GH for one night. We were there in 2nd week of May 2016, the season wasn't in full swing and most of other GH were almost empty. We moved to Yourdum GH next day and we could feel the difference between both guest houses. We booked a 3 bed room for 4 persons with an extra mattress and still the room looked spacious. The attached wash room was really big and clean with running hot water.  The food was simple but satisfying. Had fulka with sarson ka saag with picle and papad for dinner. It was a welcome dish after getting tired of eating variants of potato and cabbage preparations due to unavailability of other vegetables in Ladakh.  The view from the GH is amazing.",MaheshThipse,,"Pune, Maharashtra, India",40
ladakh,"A good family managed resort. Rooms are good, food was excellent. Service better than hotels. Running hot water, nice garden, fruit tress of apples, apricot, walnuts.  Owners are very good and helpful. They called for camel safari people as it was off season.",Surya Prakash Somani,,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,"Stayed a night at the place after a tough bike ride from Leh. Simple, cozy and elegant guesthouse that one will not have any complaints about! A few signboards help you reach the guesthouse, but not very easy to find the place. Once there it has a nice garden (flowers and vegetables) and few rooms that were empty. We had the place all for ourselves and enjoyed the evening talking.   Very polite and accommodating staff, a feature that you will notice all across Ladakh. Food was simple, yet tasty. Rooms were large enough for 2 people and may be a kid. Luke warm water was available, but we missed hot water after a tough ride. The sand dunes are fairly close (approx. 3 kms).  Will recommend for families with kids, large groups. May be a little too quiet for solo travelers.",naviinn,,Bangalore,40
ladakh,"The place was suggested by Mr. Stanzin of Gangba homestay, Leh. The single storey property has rooms with attached baths, hot running water and TV. The staff was helpful. The food was okay. We visited on a full moon night, and had a lovely visual of the bright full moon from our bed. The gurgling of melting ice water running through a channel to draw agricultural water added to the ambience. But the best part was the garden, which displayed apricot trees and rare and exquisite flowers, some of which we did not encounter anywhere else during our 10 day stay in Ladakh. The rates are reasonable. Certainly a better place to stay for a night when compared to the much touted camps in Hundur.",SomnathSarkar,,"Kolkata, India",40
ladakh,"Yourdum Guest House was booked by Gangba Home Stay and their partner ""Not Just Travel.in"". We arrived with no expectations of the place.   After a tiring 3.5-4 hours car ride from Leh, entering Yourdum Guest House will be a relief. What will first greet you is a beautiful garden, bursting with all kinds of blooms and vegetables. Very beautiful and serene.   The guest house is fully carpeted, with 5 guest rooms for either single or couple travelers. The single rooms shared a common bathroom, whilst the couple rooms have their own attached bathrooms - all in western bathroom style. There is a TV in each couple room, and a TV in the dining area. Rooms are generally clean, and sparsely furnished with a bed, curtains and bedside tables. The mattress was thick enough and the blanket",cheehuey,/Profile/cheehuey,"Singapore, Singapore",30
ladakh,"As part of our off-season trip to Ladakh we took an overnight-trip to Diskit-Hunder. Our driver-cum-guide, booked us at the Yourdum family's homestay. It was all on good faith as we had no idea of the area or the facilities available and especially with it being beginning of April, very little was open yet after the lull of winter. It just was your lucky time.  The Yourdum guest house is a facility with 5 really spacious and well furnished rooms owned by a couple assisted by their three daughters. In winters, with visitors being sparse, the family handles on their own and get staff from elsewhere in peak season. From door to room the whole place is carpeted- true to the way it is all over Leh. The beds, furnishings and bathroom fittings are good.  There is a huge certla dining",Onkar_Shetty,/Profile/Onkar_Shetty,India,40
