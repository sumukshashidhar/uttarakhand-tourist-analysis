ladakh,"I always have a predilection for family-owned businesses. Raku Guest House somehow remember me of home and feels nice. Also, it is a fine example of a family working together to make the business successful. I agreed with all the other reviews written before me so I will be brief.  Everybody speaks nice English and they are a very helpful source of info about the nearby attractions. They have a car and offer transport services to the airport or to the beginning of the Markha trek among other places. I left my luggage with the heavy and bulky items in the Guest House and trek the Markha Valley in a lightweight backpacking mode (under 10kg pack weigh). Summarizing, Raku Guest House is a fine back paper friendly guesthouse maybe a little bit more expensive than others but totally",Julian R,/Profile/924julianr,,50

Western toilets. The gardens are just stunning. So peaceful having breakfast or afternoon tea in the gardens, with the sweeping views of the mountains. This immediately puts you at peace.  We didn’t eat the food, however we were told the food is vegetarian. Excellent hot tea.  -The location- 15mins walk to central Leh with the shops and cafes. Has stunning 180 views of the mountains. Only 15mins from the airport.  -The people- Very helpful, courteous, good service.",Neha D,/Profile/nehad852,,50

The family was very obliging and took very good care of me personally when I was recovering  from mild AMS on my day or arrival. The youngest son was very friendly and chatted with me so that I could feel better. We had good wifi connections and hot water throughout  our stay even though I did not have an ensuite bathroom.

ladakh,Though staying in Raku was good experience but i found price is little high side as per the facilities provided. They are charging Rs1800 for the room where as in homestays in pphey and pyang are charged Rs800. so over all they can reduce the price or they can provide food withing that price also location is little away from market and its dark at night no street lights.

Rooms do not have any view but common area has. However, in our opinion it was operated more like a standard hotel than one home stay but had some policies followed are more like a home stay.

Location - Away from the hustle bustle of Leh market area. But it is walkable - 10 minutes walk - to the Leh market place as well. The plus point is the ability to exit from the other side so as to avoid Leh town.  The Home - The rooms are in ground and first floor. Each room is spacious with clean bathroom. The best part of the home is the lounge area on first floor. With lovely carpets spread across, sitting on them and looking at the snow clad peaks while sipping morning cuppa is a fantastic experience!  The People - We always loved Ladakhi hospitality.

Although they didn't have hot water one of the nights, they (the older son and wife of the owner) brought us these giant buckets of hot water, and I think the water was way hotter than if we had used the taps ;). (We didn't end up taking another shower there so I cannot confirm).   FYI there was no internet at all in Leh, apparently there was a place with satellite but by the time we got there it had stopped working again.

Every single night Mr.Raku would come to our room to make sure our blanket were covered us up so we wont got cold at night. They even take care of my friend who's got sick. The family was fantastic! The room was clean and the view from the guest house was amazing. The food was delicious. They even made special dinner for us when they knew it was my birthday. We gathered every night in their kitchen and had dinner together. Feels like home. No doubt, nothing compares Raku Guest House. This is what so called Home Far Away From Home. Will definitely go back there. I love you Amale & Apale!",sidnyaulia,/Profile/sidnyaulia,"Jakarta, Indonesia",50
ladakh,"The family here is kind and warm, just like its sunlit kitchen. The home is beautiful and sitting areas lovely, with expansive views of the mountains. *However*... going after ""season"" won't get you too far.  Know that the pipes freeze so the en-suite bathrooms are closed off, and there won't be running water in the communal bathrooms (but plentiful buckets of water to flush, etc). If you choose to bathe, the owner will happily heat a bucket of water for you. While heat is advertised, the owner insists it be turned off at night, so be prepared for a cold, cold night (although they provide plenty of blankets, sometimes that just doesn't cut it).    I wish we had visited during the summer or even early fall; unfortunately, our time in mid-November had an unseasonal cold snap and",ChacmoolsFriend,/Profile/ChacmoolsFriend,"New York City, New York",40
ladakh,"This hotel was a host of unsaintary conditions.   We arrived in freezing conditions below 30 degrees farheinheit to no flushing toilets no running water at all in sinks, showers or toilets.  Propane heaters with no ventalion with carbon monoxide fumes present.  There were four bedroom upstairs sharing an inopperable bathroom upstairs. There were several bedrooms and one inopperable bathroom downstairs.  The electricity was turned on and off by the owner.  We bought electric heaters with our own money and were told by the owner to turn them off.",Joy B,/Profile/JoyB480,"Venice, Florida",10
ladakh,"Raku guesthouse really is an excellent choice.  It's in a quiet location but only about a 15 minute walk to the centre of town. It's clean, has constant hot water, the rooms are large and comfortable and room 101 has a superb view. The owners are delightful!!! Having breakfast and dinner with 'the family' in their warm kitchen was a real plus point for me. They arranged taxis to and from the airport and also for day trips and nothing seemed too much trouble. I would certainly stay there again.",RogerD125,/Profile/RogerD125,"Norwich, United Kingdom",50

Raku family is very pleasant and helpful.  He made all the travel arrangement for sightseeing for us including permit.  Rooms are very spacious and super clean. Location is very peaceful with beautiful garden and organic farm. Aunty cooks delicious food and we loved every meal. We felt always at home and didn't want to leave.  Will definitely comeback here for another wonderful stay.",Munish242,/Profile/Munish242,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Stayed there for 4 nights in September 2013. Excellent stay, quiet and restful, the hosts would make anything possible to make you feel happy and comfortable. The only small downside, as already marked in another review, is that tea is not part of the price, although proposed as if it was. Not an issue per se, but it was charged on the very high side, and as a surprise on the very last day. Make this clear and there will be no other reviews than 'excellent' !",pierre n,/Profile/pierren697,"Hong Kong, China",50
ladakh,"We were a group of 6 ladies who started our journey from Srinagar. We arrived in Leh from Kargil at dinner time and were welcomed by Mr Raku. We were pleased to see very clean rooms and pleasantly surprised with enough cupboard space for 3 people sharing the room.  Our stay included breakfast (mostly bread, oats & fruits) and dinner, both were very yummy, home-made by the lady of the guesthouse. Our request for special breakfast on two mornings were kindly obliged. The whole family is very friendly and the feel is very much a home-stay experience. Their two boys who were back for summer vacation were helpful in many ways.  The guesthouse is surrounded by a nice garden and is lovely to spend some time in the morning sun or under the evening stars. All in all our 4 nights' stay",KNRSVV,/Profile/KNRSVV,"Singapore,",40
ladakh,"I stayed in Raku Guest House for 4 nights and I am going to stay again when I visit with my family.  Pros:- 1) Large spacious rooms which has very good natural lighting. 2) Hotel is very clean. 3) Quiet location but still near main market (about 500 - 700 meters away). 4) Homely made breakfast and dinner. (you can customize). 5) Customize travel for local as well Nupara valley as well as Phagong Lake. 6) Solar hot water was always available. 7) Friendly owners who maintain good customer service for 6 rooms. 8) Reasonable rates.  Cons:- 1) Internet wifi  connection don't work in room so you have to come in lobby to use it. (but it works great in lobby). Gave some suggestion to improve this. 2) No TV or phone in room, but this is not a big deal as you don't need it.",kenpat123,/Profile/kenpat123,"sanfrancisco,ca",50
ladakh,"We arrived late in the evening from srinagar by jeep and mr angchuk was kind enough to pick us up ans bring us to his guesthouse by car.   The room was sparkling clean, literally! The bed and linen were clean and big, bathroom very modern with an amazing hot shower. It was 9pm and we were still able to have dinner homemade by mr angchuks wife with veggies grown in thd garden! The price was reasonable: 200rs per person.  The location of the guesthouse is great, a leisurely 10minute stroll to the main centre.   Mr angchuk his wife and 2 sons are an amazing family who take pride in what they do, we had great conversations in their kitchen about everything and nothing!  The breakfast is amazing.

ladakh,"We stayed in the Raku guest house for seven nights from June 4th, 2013. The guest house is located in a nice and quiet area, yet the market is just about 15minutes walk from the place. The view from the guest house, particularly our room (101) was excellent. Mr. and Mrs. Raku did everything possible to make our stay comfortable. Mrs. Raku would prepare tasty meals, often at short notice when got back after trips outside Leh, and often we would dine together. Our daughter, five, would even stay back sometimes with them after the meals rather than returning to the room! The vegetables are mostly from their own garden right outside the guest house. The inside of the rooms were also immaculately done. The bathroom was excellent and hot water (from their solar heater) was available.",P_Chatterjee,/Profile/P_Chatterjee,"Noida, India",50

And, still Leh market is only 10 mins walk from here :)  Rooms were clean, spacious and with nice views. Sunlight was good in room. Bedding was comfortable. Toilets were clean and were quipped with all basic modern facilities. Guest house have solar heaters fitted, so there is 24 hours running hot water available.

We were warmly (literally and figuratively) received by Angchok and Skalzang the couple that run the guest house. Raku guest house is a lovely house not too far away from the main market. We were treated like another member of the family. It was simply amazing, Skalzang cooks amazing food, every morning we had delicious breakfasts, amazing lunches and very nice dinners. All cooked with organic local produce, I loved the local momos and the freshly baked bread.

It felt just like home...only much bigger and prettier with killer views and a lush garden :)   It is a bit off the main tourist drag--which I saw as a positive (quiet, gorgeous street with lovely views of the stars and mountains), but could be a little too quiet for some.

The care takers of the guest house are some of the nicest people I have met during my trip. It is very close from the Upper Tukcha Road and the main market.  It is a nicely maintained guest house with traditional kitchen and sitting area.

ladakh,"It is a cozy little place tucked away in Upper Tukcha road about 7 to 8 minutes from the main town center. The area is quiet. There are some good restaurants within a few minutes of walking distance, one of them being Bon Apetit. The airport is very close too. Angchuk and his wife run the place with warmth and professionalism. The entire guest house is very well done up with about seven rooms with clean toilets, some private and some shared. The common kitchen and dining area is exceptionally clean and the food served is delicious, with vegetables from their own garden. The dining area offers a lovely view of the mountains and so do some of the rooms. The rates are quite reasonable, although, breakfast I felt is a bit too expensive. Angchuk also arranges for cars and sightseeing",annapurna_2008,/Profile/annapurna_2008,"Kolkata, India",50
ladakh,"I found this just by walking around, trying to find an alternative to the over-priced and typically impersonal hotel where I had been staying. Wow was I lucky. This is a guest house owned by a friendly Ladakhi family, located on Tukcha Road about a 10-minute walk to the central market on a road with much less traffic than the center of town. Also can walk to the Chanspa area on a traffic-free path through farms and past a small waterfall.  I strongly recommend Raku and especially my room, #101. See photo.(If I can't upload it, email me and I'll send photos to you.) I woke up every morning to the beautiful light of sunrise on the highest mountain in the area, Stok Grangri.
