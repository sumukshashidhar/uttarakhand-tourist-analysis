ladakh,"Stayed on 2nd September 2019 for 1 night with family and friends (6 rooms-double occupancy and 2 rooms-triple occupancy for 18 guests). Our package included b/fast and dinner. I fell in love with the beautiful garden and apple trees. The owner Mr David is such a down to earth person, always with a smile on his lips. He even let us pick a few apples right off the trees and eat !   Do not expect 3 star or 5 star amenities as in a city hotel.I really felt in sync with this place, primarily on account of its beautiful garden, location and the feeling of ""being at home"" it gives. The owner is a very nice gentleman, always visible on the property with a smile chatting with guests...the kitchen staff/waiters are courteous and the food is really good, sort of ""ghar ka khaana"".We got hot",YP Kishore,/Profile/ypk_123,"Visakhapatnam (Vizag), India",50
ladakh,"We stayed at Sand Dune Hotel in June 2018 for two nights. The hotel is situated near the heart of Diskit, near a row of shops where you can buy daily use items. There is also an internet café nearby. The location is very quiet, typical of a small town. Very neat and clean town.  The hotel itself is very nice. Clean room, beautiful garden in the courtyard with herbs, flowers, and trees. Mr. David, the owner, is a very pleasant, kind, affectionate and welcoming person.  He took care of all of our needs. The food has a home cooked meal feel to it which is great.  For our trip to Turtuk and the next day to Pangong, Mr. David packed lunch for us in nice Sand Dune printed boxes, with sandwiches, juice, and chocolate. Everything done very professionally.  I highly recommend this hotel.",Praveen S,/Profile/703praveens,"Katy, Texas",50

ladakh,"great hospitality , very good food, electricity is a problem but not just for this hotel for the whole village.  rooms are clean, bathrooms are leaking, owner, cook and staff very courteous.  thanks for making our stay comfortable",Ashd333,/Profile/Ashd333,"Edgewater, New Jersey",50
ladakh,"A nice, clean budget hotel with extremely friendly staff. Dinesh the manager of the establishment went out of his way to ensure that our stay was comfortable and relaxing. One important point to, the whole Diskit area faces load shedding(power outage) every night from 11 PM - 10 AM. Almost all the hotels in the area have the same problem. So be prepared for the dark. And I mean its pitch dark with not a sliver of light anywhere around you. Enough and more candles are provided by the hotel. However that is one perk of being in such a remote place. Completely cut off from the world. No TV and definitely no WiFi. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is budget conscious. Great food, great location, nice garden to relax and extremely friendly staff. I would like to",kunald21,/Profile/kunald21,pune,50

ladakh,"For the bikers who are brave enough to attempt the Khardung La (La stands for pass), which at 5600 meters above sea level is the highest motorable pass in the world, the journey continues along the pristine Nubra river to the small villages of Hunder or Panamik. This was a part of the famous silk route - the ancient trade route between India and China. The landscape changes after one comes down from the pass and crosses the village of Khardung. The Nubra river cuts through the landscape and brings a green hue to the otherwise desolate landscape. In such surroundings, the Sand Dune Guest house feels right at home. It is 7 kilometers before the town of Hunder where most tourist flock to. This town is called Diskit and most of the locals are involved with the tourist trade in some",Darnie Christopher,/Profile/DarnieChristopher,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"We visited this beautiful guest house during bike trip to Ladakh in June,2015. Situated in a beautiful village in Hunder in Nubra Valley, with very well maintained rooms and close to nature. Hot water was available on request, bathroom was very clean. The owner is a nice gentleman, told many stories about Leh Ladakh. Home cooked food was provided in the dining area. Economical, close to nature, suited for everyone. Highly recommended.",Gaurav486,/Profile/Gaurav486,"Hubli-Dharwad, India",40
ladakh,"Beautiful Small Property run by owners. we loved the garden, small parking area, rooms, dining area, and the 'Apricots'. This was the most enjoyable moments of our trip where we could pluck the fresh Apricots, apples and just eat them fresh.  Food was Better than average. View was excellent from our room window, also from Bathroom window.  Bathroom was super clean.",medhas,/Profile/medhas,"Ratnagiri, India",50
ladakh,"Stayed here for a night while visiting Nubra Valley.  This guesthouse is located at Hunder with a lovely, breathtaking view of the mountain peaks around. You feel in close to nature with herds of sheep, goats and cows grazing all around. It's a budget accommodation but has all the basic amenities. Hot water is provided in a bucket in the morning.  The food cooked had the ingredients from the kitchen garden. Was served in the dining area. Served the purpose well enough!!",Ricky,/Profile/Ricky_DEL_LON_HKG,"Hong Kong, China",40
ladakh,"Dont know how to tell how good is this hotel..Owner is a nice gentleman.Service is very good.All are there to help you in any manner.Food quality is superb.Room maintenance is good.And sight view from hotel is out of the world.Preferable for family,honeymoon couple,nature lovers.",Pritam M,/Profile/null,"Kolkata, India",50
ladakh,Rooms are clean and spacious. Surroundings is calm and Quiet. Facilities are good for the given Room Tariff. The small garden is well maintained. Foods a bit costly. Problem of Frequent power cut in Nubra valley. Overally a very good and economical option to stay in Nubra valley.,BijayKumarMahanta,/Profile/BijayKumarMahanta,"Bhubaneswar, India",40
ladakh,"Nice guesthouse in a garden with good rooms, a very pleasant restaurant and an excellent service, the whole very centrally located in Diskit. A very good option. The one thing you have to think of: take some skin repellent. At sunset, during 20 minutes mosquitos can be nasty (yes, there are mosquitoes at this altitude!!!)",GillesVienna,/Profile/GillesVienna,"Paris, France",50
ladakh,"Stayed one night here and there are not too many places to stay in the small village. It was peaceful, clean and comfortable. The garden was nice with apricots everywhere. Staff were friendly and accomodating. The food was OK. It's a good enough place to stay short term but there is nothing in the village so you can see it all in 10 minutes. Relaxed and friendly atmosphere.",Allirat,/Profile/Allirat,Copenhagen,30
ladakh,"The Guest house is quite new. We paid about 1050 INR for a night, it was a very confortable stay. The bathrooms were extremely clean (maybe since they were new) with continuous supply of hot water. The room was well equipped with a TV, sufficient charging points and an emergency lamp. They do not offer room service. You will have to confirm the menu to them in advance. There is a common dining hall at the entrance that serves buffet as well as ala carte. Overall it was a pleasant stay!",Prithisquash,/Profile/Prithisquash,"Mountain View, California",40
ladakh,"The hotel is located at the end of Diskit market. It a very new property and construction is still on. They are charging as per full planned facilities inside room but all are yet to be there. Rests of the things inside room were basic and were charged INR 800 per night. This price tag may justify once all facilities are there like shower, etc once construction is over. Hot water is available between 6am till 10am. Food taste was excellent but you have to inform them in advance if you want to eat inside the property for them to arrange. Television inside room has satellite connection includes Hindi and English channels.",Souvik,/Profile/imsouvik,"Kolkata, India",40
ladakh,"The property was spic and span, bathrooms ultra clean and rooms very modern. Compared to very many hotels in Leh, this property was a welcome break from the usual. The hotel had separate blocks, each one spacious, with a common sit out then branching off into rooms. The rooms had attached bathrooms and televisions with Satellite dish connection. The owners were courteous. They also have a restaurant that serves dinner and breakfast. Food is tasty and menu, limited. Prices are reasonable by ladakh standards. We paid 800/- for the room, excluding food (Aug 2012). Would recommend this place only if it fits your budget",Vinod,/Profile/ramansvinu,Bangalore,40
ladakh,"It was my fascination to go to ladakh with my college friends, and after having planned the trip, I was really excited and looking fwd to it. I went there last week  with a couple of my geeky friends. It started with the landing in Leh at  8 am morning and there was bright sunshine comparing to the dark in Delhi an hour ago… whoa!.  It was chilly and we had to pull out our stuff. After 3 days in Leh valley , We had a two day stay in Nubra, after hearing from the locals, reached there at 2:30  in the day. The weather over there was much bttr than it was in Leh.We booked a package from Antilog Vacations which are reasonable and well known in  Leh sector  for those who r budget conscious & need customisation .The whole package costed us 18k per person  The Sand Dune guest House is",Amritesh S,/Profile/AmriteshS,"Hong Kong, China",30
ladakh,Nubra valley is a territory of not so very good hotels with even basic amenities. But however food of this place was very very nice. I found it best in entire Ladakh region.   And one more positive of the place is a very nice garden maintained by the owner.,Himanshu,/Profile/sikkimtraveller123,noida,40
