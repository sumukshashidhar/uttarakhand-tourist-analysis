ladakh,"Fantastic hotel nestled in heart of Leh. Hotel is about 300 meters from main Leh market on a quite street. Nice rooms with all amenities. Rooms are big with equally big bathrooms. Both rooms and bathrooms are kept clean everyday. Beds are comfy. Tata Sky in every room. Wi-Fi connection strength works in the room but signal strength could be improved. Thatâ€™s the only drawback I encountered. My only request to the manager is to fix this spotty Wi-Fi connection in rooms problem. This problem can easily be resolved. Hotel has generator. Leh seems to be notoriously bad for blackouts. Find a hotel with generator.  Hotel Staff is courteous, extremely helpful and friendly. On a request chef prepared a chicken curry dish just for my family. Food was delicious. Non-veg was to die for. ",anandkhare,/Profile/anandkhare,"Pune, India",50

ladakh,"I travelled to Leh on May 22nd 2017... worried not just about the altitude, but also the temperatures, I was pleasantly surprised by Hotel Ladakh Delight. The place was very nice and comfortable, with clean bedsheets and clean bathooms.  The rooms were nice and spacious where 3 of us stayed comfortably. But the real surprise was the staff who were extremely helpful. They made efforts to provide us hot drinking water. On the day we had to leave for Yama luru, they woke up at 4:30 am start preparing breakfast for us. The food was delicious as well.  What really works for Hotel Ladakh delight is the location, with a stone's throw from the main market place. Over all, a wonderful place, and definitely recommended for group of friends and family alike.",Akash M,/Profile/658akashm,,50
ladakh,"Even though we were a large group of over 40, Ladakh Delight stayed very true to its name right from start to finish. Special mentions must include the fabulous views from some of the rooms, the excellent food, and owner and his wonderful staff, who refilled our bottles and catered to our every (odd) request without complaint! The rooms are spotlessly clean, warm and yes, there really is hot water!   The hotel is also situated close to the centre, with great access to shopping, tourist destinations (the Central Asian Museum is a must-visit) and restaurants/cafes!  If you're travelling to Leh, this is the place to choose!",StorySeeker7,/Profile/StorySeeker7,"Mumbai, India",50
