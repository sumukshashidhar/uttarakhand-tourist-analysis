ladakh,"If you go to visit Pangong, you must stay at The Hermitage for that special experience. They have individual cottages covered with glass which opens to the direct view of the lake! Fascinating is the word. You can witness sunrise/sunset from the coziness of your blanket! The rooms are very spacious, well decorated with room heater. Bathrooms too are very spacious with constant hot water which is a must in that kind of weather in winter! Food was outstanding. Excellent hospitality by the staff. Only if they could provide electric kettle, it would have been a perfect stay.",aparna2009,/Profile/aparna2009,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,"We spent 2 nights at this place and the tents are very well appointed. The heating is perfect, even in the bathroom. The beds are very comfortable and the rooms are a good size. There are total 8 tents and the views of the lake are spectacular. One can lie in ones bed and enjoy the changing colors of the lake.  The only drawback of this place is that the drive to this place is very challenging. So once you get here leave only when you have to. The service is attentive and personal. The food is homely and fresh. Comfort at 14000 feet.",Aartichand,/Profile/Aartichand,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,We stayed their while we were travelling to Pangong So lake. They have rooms which are better than normal tents at any given point of time. They serve delicious food without a doubt. Service is quick and excellent. They make their efforts so that you have a comfortable stay. Plus they have space so that drivers can stay as well since they are the ones who drive you all the way their.,Nitasha D,/Profile/nitashad2017,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
ladakh,Hermitage at Pangong lake located in Man village is the best property in all of Pangong Lake area.  There are 8 yurts which include all the amenities.  While a solid structure is a rarity in Pangong (which basically offers tents) Hermitage even has central heating which includes a heated bathroom.  Pangong Lake can suddenly get very cold with strong winds.  Every yurt offers a beautiful view of the lake and its changing colours which can even be seen while lying in your bed.  Its a five minute walt to the banks of the lake.  Service is very good (since its a part of Ladakh Sarai Group).  There is no better place than Hermitage to stay in Pangong Lake (even though its about 8 km from the main area -Spagmik).,GauravChand,/Profile/GauravChand,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"The Hermitage at Pangyong is an island of comfort at 14,000+ feet! The Hermitage is not only heated, spacious and comfortable - the staff is also extremely hospitable and friendly. In such harsh conditions they are also offering fabulous food to their guests. The complete experience is wonderful. Having stayed at Pangyong earlier at other properties - we KNOW the difference!",Sunilarora57,/Profile/Sunilarora57,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"We spent two nights at this mesmerizing property in June this year and now we feel it would have been great to spend a few more nights here. I have no hesitation in mentioning that Pangong Hermitage exceeded my expectation in every possible way. The location is probably the best in Pangong, seven kilometers away from the crowded Spangmik. Being avid bird lovers, we spent two days spotting and clicking plenty of birds. The entire team was extremely helpful and often went out of the way to make sure that we have a great time. Finally, I would also thank the kitchen team for the beautiful dishes they prepared for us.   Would love to be here again during our next trip to Ladakh.",Indranil b,/Profile/IBhattacharjee,"Kolkata, India",50

ladakh,This is one of the best hotels at Pangong Lake with a splendid view! Right on the pristine lake  with comfortable and classy rooms. The service is good. The location is remote and getting there can be difficult but once their its worth the trouble.Food is good and tasty the best possible in this kind of location.

ladakh,"What a superb location it is. By the side of heavenly Pangong lake. Reaching here is quite an achievement; however once you are here, it's heaven.  It's a tent from outside and well constructed from within. The front side is full glass so that one can keep watching the beauty of the lake for hours, sitting in the comfort of the room. The outside is quite chilly and windy, sitting inside therefore is preferred especially in the evenings.  Nice cosy rooms. Excellent beds. Very good toilets. Not easy to get this in such a remote part of the country.  Very good food. Local food is very tasty and served very hot.   Staff has great attitude. Very helpful, cooperative and supportive.  It's an expensive place but worth it considering the facilities provided at such a remote place.",Satish P,/Profile/SatishP474,"Thane, India",50
ladakh,"We stayed for one night last week. First the Pros -  The location - Right on the pristine lake,in the middle of nowhere,far away from the other crowded messy campsites. Nothing can beat the location. The yurts - Unexpected luxury with heating,though they didnt have the bathroom radiator on.The bathroom otherwise was large & quite decent. Food - again unexpected....the dinner was good& more important fresh & hot. I was surprised that they served courses,all the starters were not good but largely the food was  appetising. Same with breakfast...the pancakes were fantastic,the paranthas & puris were good too. Again we were surprised at the variety. The service was decent. No TV & internet which was wonderful.  Now the cons- The location whie being great to admire the beauty of the",travelbugDelhi,/Profile/travelbugDelhi,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"Isolated location with stunning view of Pangong lake. Interior of the room & atmosphere is 4 stars when compare of the rest of tents in few kilometre behind. Dinner was excellent, overexpectation in the remote area like this. However, our lunch box in the next day was very poor in term of quality and quantity. They provided us the amount of food for 4 persons instead of 13 persons that we paid.",Supernara,/Profile/Supernara,"Bangkok, Thailand",40
ladakh,"This property no doubt offers and amazing view from the room but the price you pay for it is just too high. Anyways Pangong lake is very beautiful and just paying so much for the view doesn't make sense since you could experience it at a cheaper rate. The rooms are average and when we checked in our room, all the drawers had broken knobs and all in it. The rooms are heated which is definitely a luxury and a must in Pangong lake at any time of the year because of the unpredictable weather but you could research more for heated rooms, if there is any other property which offers it at cheaper rate.  From the room, there is no connectivity to the reception so for the smallest of things you need to rush to the kitchen or reception yourself. There is nothing in the property apart from",Nisha D,/Profile/NishaSurana,"New Delhi, India",30
ladakh,"Pangong Heritage Camp has the best location among the many hotels beside the lake. Their design of luxury tents, bathrooms, booking experience - everything was just great. I would have given then 5 stars, if not for their sub-standard food and nonchalant service. Advise to the management - get your chef/kitchen staff and service people trained at Ladakh Sarai for a month - this hotel will become one of the best in Ladakh. Thanks!",gneil99,/Profile/gneil99,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,"The hotel is made in Luxurious tent style but very comfortable with heating and all amenities. The food is also decent. Service is also good. strongly recommend for the extreme weather at Pangong Lake.  The rooms are good and well equipped. But needs a few improvements like at least 3 bottles of water per day, Tissue box etc.",pagarwalmumbai,/Profile/pagarwalmumbai,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"Our family of 3 stayed here for 1 night, 1 day. Once we got over the fact that the camp is situated literally in the middle of nowhere (it's 8 kms away from the other camps) the beauty of the place took over!  Situated bang on the lake, the luxury tents are equipped with everything you might need (there is no TV but there is a study table) What won us over was the variety of food and the exceptional service. The staff was warm, courteous and really pampered us. Loved the experience!",Anisha S,/Profile/918anishas,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"We stayed over night with my kids at the Hermitage. It was outstanding. There was hot water, warm clean sheets, the staff was very helpful..and the food was fresh and well flavoured. I highly recommend the chola bhatura, kashmiri aloo and khichdi. Their staff needs special mention, they were constantly smiling and always managed to help. The journey to the Hermitage is tough. Once you see the lake, its almost an hour from there, on a dusty track, through streams. The only place to stay at Pangong.",Aparajita J,/Profile/aparajitaj673,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"After visiting the beautiful lake and a crazy long journey when we checked in we were welcomed with some good tea and pakoras and beautiful rooms! The super luxurious tents are beautiful, very well kept, warm and super comfortable!   Their food was great! They served a variety of Indian and continental food.  However the hotel owners need to add a lot more to the place. Landscaping is terrible and non-existential , the staff is just about average. For a luxurious place like this and the kind of charges they have for a night they really need to focus on other things apart from just the room.

ladakh,"Though you have a long drive, getting to the Pangong Hermitage it was well worth it! Made to look like tents the rooms are cosy and comfortable. The views were great with the lake in front and the mountains surrounding you. Food though vegetarian was also really good and the staff were helpful and courteous. Well worth the drive!!",Farida M,/Profile/Fmasani,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Words can't describe the creature comforts and luxury provided by the hermitage in this remote village of Maan along the great Pangong Tso. Waking up to the lake a short distance away with great room and loo heating, not to mention the fantastic sleep quality... made to order meals (depending on the availability of ingredients) and the super friendly staff! Loved it. Having been to Pangong multiple time since 2004, This place has been the best addition to the lake yet.",ThePrateekSethi,/Profile/ThePrateekSethi,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Well this review is about the booking practices of the hotel. We had a confirmed booking through booking.com but the hotel refused to provide rooms despite the confirmation voucher . There was no manager at the resort and the head office guy cut us off when we at last managed to get in touch with him.  They offered us rooms in the associate property without telling us the charges for the same. We had no choice but to accept as it was evening already in a very cold place at a high altitude.  To be fair the associate property was not too bad and the staff there was super friendly. In the morning after a bit of argument the stay was provided ""free'. Still not sure whether the booking site will charge us though? ",Harsh R,/Profile/harshr967,"Mumbai, India",10
ladakh,"Our stay at the Pangong Hermitage was well worth the drive to get there. Luxurious accommodation and impeccable service at such a remote location is simply exceptional! From the gorgeous rooms looking out into the lake to the amazing food, this was a truly memorable experience, one that we will surely return for. Highly highly recommended if you want to stay nice and warm and cozy but still enjoy the beauty of the amazing Pangong Lake without camping it out in the cold winds! It's far away from all the crowded camps and is the only 5 star hotel in Pangong and totally worth it 👍🏻",Simran K,/Profile/simrank999,,50
ladakh,"A fantastic place at the front of the small village of Maan, that has all of 160 people. It is far, far better than Spangmik, the first village on Pangong that's completely overrun by tents, dirt and noisy holiday makers. The Pangong effect is ruined in Spangmik. So this village, and Merak after it, are the better options for sure.  All the beautiful pictures that you see of the Hermitage are true. The team that looks after the place are friendly and are from Mandi in Himachal Pradesh. The walk up the small plateau at the back of the rooms is nice, with sweeping views on three sides.

ladakh,This property is situated at the bank of Pangong lake. Well designed rooms with awesome lake view. Homely food. Very sincere and courteous staff. Though the hotel can do better by adding some services like bonfire and serving drinks. ,rahulomarora,/Profile/rahulomarora,"Lucknow, India",50
ladakh,"Travelling to remote locations is adventurous, though not everyone’s cup of tea. If you are planning on going to Ladakh region of Kashmir in India, it can get downright dangerous as well, in addition to hardships and lack of comforts one may encounter. But then this is what adventure is all about. Travelling to Leh, Nubra valley, and Pangong lake in Ladakh region is something everyone must attempt in their lifetime. Lowest height on this tour being the capital ‘Leh’ at 11500 feet. Facilities are being constantly improved over time, but given that the land route is open only five months a year, some hardships should be tolerated.  Visit to Pangong Hermitage was, however, a memorable experience. Accommodation and food was of excellent quality and worth every penny that we spent",wallacejain,/Profile/wallacejain,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"If there's anything that could complement the beauty of the Pangong lake, it would have to be the facilities & staff at the Pangong hermitage resort. In room heating, running hot water and a battery of smiling faces ready to bring you whatever you needed to be comfortable and have a wonderful experience.

ladakh,After a tiring journey we first had a glimpse of the vast Pangong lake which mesmerised us. We further drove along the Pangong to reach this wonderful place. The first view of our cottages and tiredness was left behind.  After settling into our cottages we were served hot pakoras and tea exactly what we were wanting to eat after a tiring journey.  The heating in the rooms kept the temperature just perfect. The bed was warm and comfortable. The bathroom spacious and clean.  The dinner was served on the table itself in the dining room which was again warm and comfortable. The staff is hospitable and polite.   In this vast canvas of perfection the only thing I felt lacking was their not keeping and serving bottled water which can be a problem for travellers who do not drink boiled,Ranjana T,/Profile/RanjanaT22,"Nainital, India",50
ladakh,"Arguably the best place to stay at Pangong Tsho. Away from the hustle bustle of the main tourist hub by the lake, this place is a true hermitage. Hospitality is at its best. Most comfortable accommodation and delicious food, all at a moderate rate. The staff are ever smiling and courteous. View from the cottages is spectacular. There are some resident pika/ mouse hare within the campus which will keep the occupants busy with their cute movements. A must stay at Pangong or while at Ladakh.

ladakh,The hermitage at Pangong is definitely one of the best properties. The difficult and harsh weather conditions at Pangong makes the hermitage an ideal place to stay when traveling with kids and family. There is central heating in all cottages with 24 hrs electricity and hot water. The menu is good and food is tasty. The staff is very cordial and always ready to go an extra mile to make your stay comfortable. The only drawback is that it's the farthest property in Pangong and so needs to travel half an Hr extra travel time. The cost is on a higher side but it's a paisa vasool for the facilities they provide.  Dr Mayank gupta,Dr_Mayank_Gupta,/Profile/Dr_Mayank_Gupta,Madurai,50
ladakh,"Pangong is one of the most beautiful places  on earth, and Pangong Hermitage is probably one of the best hotels I have stayed in ( including in almost 20 countries) . The rooms are very spacious and the multiple windows throughout the length of the rooms provide spectacular views of the lake and mountains.  The food was great with a huge spread from Italian to Indian and the service was extremely prompt and courteous.  I wish I could have given more than 5 stars.",Gopal R,/Profile/GopalR975,,50
ladakh,"Adequately equipped Swiss cottages overlooking the Pangong Lake with room heaters to keep you warm during the freezing nights. The arduous journey to reach this location is well worth it, why arduous…oh the road…where is road…a dirt track along the lake (approximately 10 kms) but all is worth it to see the vivacious face of lake changing its garb in split second from light blue to royal blue to cobalt blue to Aquamarine to turquoise to sea green and so on. There are eight cottages in this property offering the similar view set in the backdrop of snow clad mountains. All meals are served in common room which is laid out aesthetically.

ladakh,"The Camp is located right on the Pangong Lake. It is locate at some distance from the main camp site, but the location is just perfect. It is very peaceful and serene. Each room is a very luxurious huge tent. It has all the luxuries of a 5 star hotel. The food has more of a home taste and the caretaker there is very friendly and makes you feel absolutely at home. The tent is temperature controlled and very comfortable. All room have the same view so there is no choice when selecting the rooms. The only downside is that there is nothing else to do there except gapping at the STUNNING Pangong lake. It is a perfect place to relax and unwind. The approach road from Leh is not all smooth road with a lot of broken roads but according to me the travel is worth the beauty.",Khushru Doctor,/Profile/KFDOCTOR,"Ahmedabad, India",50
