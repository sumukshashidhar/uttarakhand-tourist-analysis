ladakh,"Me and my friend spent 16 days at the De Apple Tree Guest House in september, and we are super happy with our stay. This wonderful family took really good care of us, and they were all so kind and helpful.  We had breakfast and dinner included in our stay, and our beautiful host Pal (Spalzez Angmo) and her Nepali chef was really flexible with what we wanted to eat and when we wanted to take our meals. The food (and the chai!) was really good, everything clean and freshly prepared. (With vegetables from the beautiful garden outside the house).  Our room had a balcony and a stunning view of mountain ranges, tall trees, Leh city with Leh palace and the monastery above.  Just laying in bed and looking out the tall windows was magical.

ladakh,"So much of warmth and hospitality will remain permanently embedded in our memories. How can any one forget the gesture of warmth when the restaurant was reopened by Tashi at 01.00AM to serve us dinner even when we did not have any bookings with them proving the proverb ."" अतिथि देवो भव"" in letter and spirit. The stay was at par with 5 Start facilities.  Food was sumptuous delicious and more than that was served with all traditional flavor and passion. A real Home away from Home.",ColVirenderSingh,/Profile/ColVirenderSingh,"Panchkula, India",50
