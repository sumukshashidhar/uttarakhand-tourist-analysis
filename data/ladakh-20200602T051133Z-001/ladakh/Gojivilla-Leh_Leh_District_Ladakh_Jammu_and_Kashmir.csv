ladakh,"Easily the best hotel that I have ever stayed in so far. My friend and I (2 female) visited ladakh for the first time, for 2 weeks.  Friendly service, a beautiful, large bright room with comfortable bed and beautiful view. Fabulous patio restaurant with amazing views of snow capped Mountains, monasteries and Old Palace. Actually gives a very peaceful, relaxing outlook. Friendly, helpful and polite staffs (Mansoor, Abu, Puran, Ankit) all round & wonderful manager (Tashi) always available when needed. Detailed attention paid to clients need. Stayed here for entire time we were in Leh and always felt at ease. Personally, felt like a home away from home, I truly appreciate the hospitality.  Variety of breakfast and dinner options. Different cuisine on different days. Appreciate",N Gurung,/Profile/Ngurung,,50

ladakh,"I will highly recommend goji Villa to all leh lovers. Wonderful team. Super service and super excellent food. Thank you Tashi ji, Mansoor, Binita and our favorite Sanjana. Without you guys our Leh stay would not be the same",Poonam R,/Profile/PoonamR171,,50
ladakh,"As soon as we arrived to leh , we checked into one Hotel named JAN PALACE. This hotel failed to impress me.JAN PALACE had very limited food choice. Even the staff at the said hotel were not that friendly. Upon our request, our tour agent changed our hotel and relocated us to Goji villa. Trust me this is an awesome place to stay. I loved the ambience and food. People at Goji Villa were friendly and hospitable. The manager of Goji Villa Ms. Sanjana was very friendly and  energitic. During evenings I was  always welcomed  with a nice cup of hot tea. We were given a  room on the 1st floor which had a view of Leh Palace on top of the mountain.  Believe me the view was a treat to my eyes. That apart Goji villa has a beautiful rooftop dining area and the view from there is spectacular",resh2018,/Profile/resh2018,"Bangalore District, India",50
ladakh,Clean rooms with excellent view; especially from the roof- top dining area. Away from the hustle-bustle and traffic noise and yet walking distance from the town. Good place to relax and rejuvenate with family and friends. ,Kunzang D,/Profile/kunzangd2017,,50
