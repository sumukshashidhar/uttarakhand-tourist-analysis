ladakh,Walkable to the city center. the hotel owners arranged two days of tours including a hike and lunch at their own home which is a couple of kilometers from the hotel. The hotel has a full vegetable and flower garden and the owners go out of their way to please. Located near the Shanti Stupa. This was our first trip to Ladakh and so different to what most people see in India. Really an eye opener. August temperatures very pleasant but don't go in winter the climate there is cruel. Try going there by bus from Manali a lifetime memorable experience. Carry on to Kashmir if possible otherwise fly out to Delhi,Rodney A,/Profile/Rodney66,"Vancouver, Canada",50

ladakh,"We were Six Couples who visited Leh-Ladakh between 30th Aug'18 to 06th Sept'18. Our Trip was very mych planned & guided by Mr.Rigzin Dorjee. HE is a Wonderful, Smart & Cooperative guy. Before going there were many questions and fear about the Altitude sickness & other things. But, he guided us time to time what to do * what not to which really helped all of us to keep ourselves fit. His Hotel Staff, Driver & Team were wonderful to serve us at the tip of call. Pure Veg Food was served with delicious aura of options whivehever was possible for them. Oxygen level is too lesser to survive for the tourists coming from different region. So Plan minimum 6 months before & keep yourself Fit with minimum Walking of 3 kms to 8 kms till the end of the trip. Its the beauty of Nature of",akshayajhaveri,/Profile/akshayajhaveri,"Solapur, India",50
