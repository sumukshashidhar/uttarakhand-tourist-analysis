ladakh,"I stayed here with my friends in July for one night. However I absolutely loved my stay here. I wish I had stayed longer. I loved the view, the ambience, the service, the staff and the food. The rooms were warm, spacious and had tasteful interiors. The dinner buffet was so yummy and we were provided with unlimited refills. The little stream running through the property was wonderful. All in all a great stay.",Rijuta T,/Profile/rijutat2016,"Pondicherry, India",40

ladakh,"Woohoo... Cheers to the entire team of Lotus Eco Resort. This resort stayed in my mind for long after the trip. Its very cozy and comfortable. The view is super nice. And the staff is very young and cooperative. It was really good to see some young energy running a business. Felt really nice. They were friendly, they were helpful and they were on toes. The rooms are built in cottages. Each cottage has 2 rooms. And seriously, they are huge. There is a porch area, then there is a chilling area and then a master bed. What a nice design. We loved it the moment we entered in. We ordered some food in the room as we were very tired. And the food was delicious. There was hot water for bath and they provide thermos for drinking water. Thats super cool. The dining are is cozy and warm. As",Kedar Mainkar,/Profile/bhatkyakedru,"Mumbai, India",50

ladakh,"Surrounded by eye catching views of mountain, the location couldn't be any better for someone who wants peace of mind. The pristine view of natural beauties from the window of the resort room is worth staying as much in the hotel as going around. The glimpse of mountains from between the trees of the resort garden and the jaw dropping view of the small resort pond amidst beautiful blossomed flower is certainly worth staying for everyone visiting Nubra Valley. Early morning sight of mountains lit with first ray of sun and view of distant bright stars at night from the hotel room makes it in an ideal destination for people on a mission to experience Ladhak‚Äôs paradise.  The resort provides a perfect amalgamation of traditional as well as highly modern facilities well suited for",Din,/Profile/Lihla,,50
ladakh,"Me and my wife travelled this place last year. We found this place safe and their food quality was excellent.Their stuffs are supper friendly. They have free wi-fi. They do not have a swimming pool , however they do have a splash pond with nice mountain and garden view. Overall it was a nice sweet exeperience.",Subrata S,/Profile/subratas644,,50
ladakh,Very very good and charming.... Beautiful side seen and identical food storage. Stuffs are most entertaining in all the way also the owner is the best. Visiting there was a great dream to me. I really liked all the way.,Ranak D,/Profile/RanakD,,50
ladakh,"This is a beautiful property with lovely rooms.  However the entire place needs a good deep-cleaning and attention to detail.  Most of the rooms I saw were two room suites with a fireplace. Since it was July, a fire wasn‚Äôt necessary.  The bathroom had good hot water and decent water pressure.  This was the best part about staying at this property.  The room lighting is very bad, and electricity is unstable.   I also noticed that it took a long time to charge up some devices.   Stones in the walkway are picturesque, but uneven.  If you have mobility problems, you might want to bring a walking stick.",Esther P,/Profile/EstherP1882,"Chicago, Illinois",30
ladakh,"We started there only for a night. The rooms were spacious and head the touch of 'Eco'.  Running hot water only in the morning from 6-8, as they need to conserve everything, which is generated by the locals. No tea/coffee making options on the room, which for me is a  disappointment. We had a lovely bonfire in the night which the hotel helped organise at a cost. The dining room is rather small, but the food not bad. No non-veg.  With only 5-6 ppl managing the place, it can do with better upkeep, though the staff was very polite and helpful. Since it was rather cold in the night, they provided me with a cute little hot water bag üòä",Renuka K,/Profile/renukak971,,20
ladakh,"This is a fairly nice place. The room are huge and clean. The location is nice. It is close to the sand dunes.  I had some of the best meals of my trip here. The food was good. And they are such hospitable people.  I did face a little issues with the water availability, but the staff was really nice and fixed that super quick.  Overall, you will have a nice stay, if you visit this place.",Kaveri Harit,/Profile/Kaveri_Harit,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"After the long tiring route to Nubra, we were looking for forward for an extremely peaceful and relaxing place to stay....and Lotus Eco was just the place for us! The rooms were very spacious and super comfortable with a hall attached. We even had a fire place in our room. The hotel staff was extremely helpful. The food was just ""okay"" but everything else was a thumbs up :)",SHIVANI-VERMA2016,/Profile/SHIVANI-VERMA2016,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"This is listed as an 'Eco resort, if that means wildly overgrown untidy unkempt grassy 'gardens' this is the place.  The chalets are spacious and clean, but the surrounds are off-putting.

ladakh,"Really impressed by its serene location, very beautifully crafted resort, a small stream of water with colorful flowers in the premises is great excitement.  The attitude of the staff was very cordial.  You get all the basic amenities you require for a pleasant vacation at very reasonable cost.",Jaidev_Katoch,/Profile/Jaidev_Katoch,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"Our 'room' was in fact a suite with a sitting area (fireplace not functioning in summer), large bedroom and good bathroom.  Water supply was a little if-fy but we did manage one good shower.  Food was unusually good.  Wifi was working.  Staff were nice but not terribly efficient.  Grounds were terribly overgrown - a shame because the garden could have been a real plus.",dotc2015,/Profile/dotc2015,Arizona,40
ladakh,"We checked in the evening, the hotel had our bookings and had called to confirm that.  The rooms were super spacious and the bathroom was neat and clean  There was also a fire place in the room,   Service as usual in ladakh was excellent and people were friendly  In the morning we walked behind to the river behind the camp, that was amazing  Overall recommend it and would revisit. The hotel even had wifi in the rooms...

ladakh,"It has great view of the mountains. There is fire place inside the room, which they give you as complementary. Rooms are clean. Food has variety and is good.During night, we sat out, under a beautiful sky filled with stars, it was an amazing experience. In the morning you can take a walk in the campus, and enjoy the view of the mountains. Overall good spacious rooms, good food and good service.",Arjun M,/Profile/arjunm2013,,40
ladakh,"Beautiful location.  Great views of the Himalayas.  Situated in a remote village. Peaceful.  Safety concern.   I stayed here for 1 night with my wife.   And from what I learnt from the staff, this is their second season. A Relatively new resort. I wish I could have stayed more than one day.  But when you're @ the resort you may feel rather insecure. As there's no mobile network (only BSNL) and no wifi. The resort has its wifi. But I was able to use it only for 15 minutes. After that it didn't work. So basically you are cut off from the world, there's absolutely no way of communicating with the outside world except the staff's own mobile phone. Also getting transport to the nearest bus station in DISKIT(8kms) is very difficult. So you're totally dependent on your taxi driver. One",Anirudh A,/Profile/AnirudhA81,,20

ladakh,"Lotus Eco Resort is one of the best resorts in Leh. We stayed there in the month of May. It was an awesome experience. Rooms are very spacious and cozy. Food was excellent. We had a great time there. A great place to stay. The only feedback I would have is to perhaps play some soft music in the dining hall (sitting and eating in dead silence, alone except for staff can be a little intimidating).",gauravsvt,/Profile/gauravsvt,"Ghaziabad, India",50
ladakh,"Nubra Valley was our first destination during the Leh-Ladakh trip. And after having been slightly choosy and stingy with the hotels we had taken during the trip so far, I decided to splurge on this one and the one in Pangong as they were the main highlights of the trip. Whilst this place is good, i feel it's way too expensive at close to 5.2k per room for a night. Especially, since most of us do not reach here before evening after scaling the mighty Khardungla. The food was decent and the service was a mixed bag. It seemed good initially, but it slowly started unraveling itself. The manager / care taker offered spa / massage therapy which we readily took after a rough ride on the Khardungla. However, as soon as it was done, he asked for half the payment in cash and asked not to",Aniil A P,/Profile/AniilP,"Thane, India",30

The hospitality provided by the staff was more than what u get in 5 stars hotels. They treat as a VVIP . The quality of the novels and books is very very good .. in one sentence home away from home..

ladakh,The staff is very co operative. And believe me a year or after it would be the best hotel in the whole Nubra valley. The manager is too helpful! As well as the food is good. I would like to mention the Eco part of this resort. Lovely Enviorment. There's also a place for Camp fire. There's a kind of small river going through the Resort.,vinitvithalani,/Profile/vinitvithalani,,40
