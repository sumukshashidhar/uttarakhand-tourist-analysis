ladakh,"Greeshma and her husband Kaustubh are simply amazing! They will make you feel at home from the first second, they will take care of you and pamper you the first day because you should rest so you don't get the hight sickness (IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO REST, OTHERWISE YOULL GET IT A 100%), I'm used to live in a high city and still at Leh I had to rest.  The first day Kaustubh asked me if I knew what to do and I didn't so he told me to go to the castle and the monastery, then rest and after go see the sunset at the Shanti stupa, it was the beeest plan ever.  Also Greeshma and him told me if I was planning to do a road trip which I was and it was Saturday so they told me to make the permits that day, otherwise I was not going to be able to do it latter, they care about you and",Carmen Aramoni,/Profile/CarmenAramonib,"Mexico City, Mexico",50

ladakh,"I had liked the most important thing is the Hostel concept which is better than any 3/5/7 Star hotel. In that hostel, there have neat and clean rooms with the different kinds of themes maintained by Mr. Kaustubh & his wife Greeshma. The Hostel is a superb concept where we enjoyed an open kitchen structure. Mr. Kaustubh & Mrs. Greeshma who are the friendly owners with everyone & their staffs are very nice & sincere. The main market road is very convenient from the hostel. We had started our journey from Srinagar to Leh which was preplanned by Mr. Kaustubh & it was a great experience, as i had enjoyed lot those 10 days journey with my family and friends. I would like to suggest everyone, if u want to stay in Leh, the ""Rover's Den"" is the very nice hostel concept to enjoy. Thank",Rahul Morvekar,/Profile/RASHEE,,50

ladakh,Nice and homely stay in leh - ladakh. I travelled with a group of friends and we had lovely time for 5 days in leh here. Clean and good rooms. Most importantly good on your pocket yet all necessary facilities available.  Nice small cafe which offers tasty and home cooked food.  I'll definitely recommend this place to others.,Uday joglekar,/Profile/JoglekarUday,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"It's quite a lot more than a hostel, throughout my stay the hosts Greeshma n Kaustubh were very helpful in planning my travel. The hostel has very cool vibes, u are almost surrounded by the lively souls. The rooms were very cozy. I got good hot water supply throughout the day. In evenings it used to be bonfire which brought people together n u get to meet different people. It helps when u are traveling solo as it increases the chances of getting co-travellers specially in the place like leh where traveling alone is a costly affair. A day I kept at leisure n I didn't wanted to go out for food even, Greeshma offered me lunch n dinner both n we did planting activity together. Overall I would recommend this place to every traveller but specially to the ones who are traveling solo.",Swati Sharnagat,/Profile/Swati_sharnagat,,50

ladakh,"I landed in Leh alone not knowing anything and directly reached this place. Never thought I will get so much attached to it becoz of the amazing people I met “Greeshma, KD, TD and Uncle” becoz of whom I was most comfortable and felt just like a new home. it’s definitely a place meant for travellers and wanderers n meeting new people each day to chill around with, sharing good vibes and feel peace.

ladakh,"Have you ever missed a place where you stayed when you're back home from a trip? Well this was the first time I did.... Rovers den is that home away from home I got in Leh. Kaustubh n Greeshma are the best hosts one couldve asked for! Ever accomodating and amazing people!  Its a place for all! Whether you are travelling with friends, solo or with your family...... The location of the hostel is also such that most of the places one must visit in Leh are walking distance away.  Basic hygiene is perfectly maintained! And the best part?! The kitchen is open for anyone staying at Rovers!!! You can cook your own meals any time of the day!  Another thing worth a mention here is that if you guys are looking for someone who can help you plan a tour in ladakh, Greeshma and Kaustubh are",Devyani T,/Profile/DevyaniT6,,50

Hosts Greeshma and Kaustubh are extremely friendly and accommodating. I can guarantee that your stay here will be full of fun and excitement. The hosts have several contacts for all the activities you might want to do around Leh and will also help you get you bookings done. Apart from that, the place is clean and comfortable. The beds are extremely comfortable and the bathrooms are clean with ample hot water (really needed in that cold weather!). The shared kitchen has all the basic equipment along with common spices and condiments. Lastly, the whole experience is amazing! Thanks :P",Rutvik K,/Profile/704rutvikk,,50

ladakh,"I'm Visiting Leh for many years now but this place is so wonderful that I'ld rather say this is the best place I've ever stayed in Leh. It actually feels like home & this two amazing hosts are like your extended family.       The entire concept of hosteling, very comfortable & cozy rooms, thoughtful designs & paintings, the road maps on wall, the open to all kitchen, the bonfire at nights, late night chit chatting, endless discussion of routes & travel plans,  Pohe made by Grishma & not to forget the playlist (Indian Rock ;-) ) I'm just missing everything even right now.            I really love staying with you Grishma & Kaustubh, I deeply regret that I had to go very early & could not enjoy for longer duration, but I promise you guys next year I'm gonna stay longer for sure.",Saket P,/Profile/438saketp,"Pune, India",50
ladakh,My wife were on a roadtrip from Bangalore to Leh and we came across Rovers Den when looking for a place to stay at Leh. The Leh palace is at a walking distance from the den. Greeshma was very friendly and accommodating host. They provided us a place to park our car and a cosy and neat room. As we were on a very tight schedule (covering Bangalore-Leh-Bangalore in 15 days) we could not really spend much time at the Den. We rented a bike from a nearby shop and spend most of the day in Leh city.  I got some great advice for planning my onward journey towards Nubra valley from the hosts. Overall it was a very comfortable stay and I would recommend this place to fellow travelers.,Aditya_salian,/Profile/Aditya_salian,"Bengaluru, India",40

Its a great place to Chill after a day of exploring, to share travel stories, share food cooked in the common kitchen.. or momos served with great enthusiasm byt TD the aspiring chef!

Due to rear wheel jam at Manali, I took 30 hr bus ride to Leh & landed in Rovers Den after a friend gave me Ms. Greeshma's contacts.

Apart from good night's stay, common kitchen where you can cook your quick breakfast, read books, play games, barbecue, chat, play music, sing, paint & get all Creativity unleashed within yourselves!
