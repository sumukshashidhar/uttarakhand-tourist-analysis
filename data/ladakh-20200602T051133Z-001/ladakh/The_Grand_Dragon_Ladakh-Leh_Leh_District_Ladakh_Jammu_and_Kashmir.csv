ladakh,"I along with my 3 friends had some spare week time in which we decided to try a cold destination which is equally adventurous. We finalised on Leh Ladakh & wanted a hotel which is truly an experience in itself. Upon my friends' reference, we got to know about a local tour company in J&K ""Roamland Holidays""  After few quotes, they suggested this hotel ""Grand Dragon"" & the trip went awesome. The overall experience of stay, places, driver & yes, the personal touch of this tour company Roamland was fantastic. We thank Mr. Sahil Ashraf & their team for such a constant courteous service from getting the start quote till end of our trip. Ladakh is truly a magical land, which is must visit for everyone. We had a thrill-filled tour which really made our week getaway great & memorable.",Rakesh Seth,/Profile/Rakesh818,,50

ladakh,October 2018 we visited this place. The Netflix series bard of blood was being shot and the entire crew was staying here with us. We practically ate and shared the lobbies with them. It’s a fantastic hotel and the staff and management are vigilant and do not leave any opportunity to ensure the guests are well aware about altitude and weather conditions. Food is fantastic. I had sleeping disorder and I used to sit and write at the restaurant throughout the night and they served me coffee and cookies voluntarily and upon my insistence also they did not charge me for any.

ladakh,"Stayed at this place during a business visit to Leh in early March. Check in was smooth and was given a small pouch with camphor to sniff in case of altitude sickness. Room was spacious and comfortable. Loved the heating which was just appropriate enough for me to move around the room in my summer clothes. Mind you, the heating in Leh is not the regular ones that we use in Delhi which can sap up the meagre oxygen available there. The first day was spent in acclimatising hence was indoors. Ordered food through in room dining. Food was good. Next day buffet breakfast was one of the best I have had in Leh. The chef suggested I taste the Ladakhi roti which I did with some fresh organic honey which was thick and granular and just amazing.

Not just excellent for India but a world class hotel that would be classed as excellent in any location. The reception area is big with multiple seating areas and the staff were uniformly welcoming and helpful.  I was assigned the same room which had stunning views out to the surrounding snow capped mountains for both stays. The first thing I noticed was the state of repair of the room. It was squeaky clean with no scuff marks and also very quiet. The queen bed was comfortable with good linen.

Temperatures can drop to minus 20 degrees Centigrade, and more,  during the winter. We stayed at the Grand Dragon in December 2019.   Keeping a hotel open in winter in Leh is a significant challenge.

Despite our frequent endeavour on the hills, we’ve never refrained from exploring new places. Ladakh had to be one. Thank you to the Conde Nast Traveller for guiding us to what happened to be one of our life’s most cherished experience all nestled well at an altitude of roughly 3000 meters— The Grand Dragon, Ladakh.  A brief walk away from the city centre, it’s the home away from home one cherishes to have. Snow caps in front of you, bells ringing in a far corner and the gushing wind accompanying you in your stay is part of what made this experience so great.

A few days before I was leaving for Leh, I called the hotel concierge to get the cab rates to different places as the prices from one place to the other vary a lot and I wanted to be sure about them. Also, it is always a great idea to make the bookings in advance to avoid last minute problems and chaos.

The Wi-Fi signals are good for a while but they can easily fade out as soon as your phone is in an inactive mode.  The one point worth noting out is the rates they charge for an ala carte meal or in room dining are over the roof, though the taste of their food can be termed as good. An example would be that they do not charge any sort of sandwiches less than Rs.500. A Ladakhi Thukpa would cost you over Rs. 1000.

ladakh,We stayed for 2 nights at the Grand Dragon.  A lovely heritage style hotel about 15 minutes walk from Leh town.  Very comfortable stay here - staff service levels were high.  We ate a dinner in the buffet restaurant - excellent choices and good standard of food.  Breakfasts were equally good.  Our room was kept spotlessly clean and Bhupender in housekeeping was really attentive- very helpful when I mentioned that my partner was unwell (nothing to do with the hotel) and he was checking whether we needs a doctor and if we needed any other services.  Excellent customer service from him in particular.  Would thoroughly recommend a stay here - Only slight negative is that they feel it necessary to charge extra for the sauna/steamroom.,TimHarding,/Profile/TimHarding,"Eversley, United Kingdom",50

When we turned up after 24 hrs travelling, it became clear we were actually booked into another hotel - also very nice but very different (and I suspect a good deal cheaper). The staff at both hotels were very helpful and I have no gripes with either of them: however, I am trying to take this up with TripAdvisor (which seems to have no customer service helpline).

The front desk was attentive and arranged for a good car and driver to our visit to Alchi. It was a pleasant stay, and my only complaints are the somewhat unimaginative food offerings (is there no alternative to chicken tikka masala or palak paneer?) and the high price.

How is it possible that they do not have a map of the area; but you can buy one in the gift shop. For a large hotel, how do they not have the ability to exchange dollars? Do do they not have a cashier that can change 1000 rupees, or even 100 rupees.  I think they don't want to change, so",stoneiam,/Profile/stoneiam,"Miami, Florida",40
