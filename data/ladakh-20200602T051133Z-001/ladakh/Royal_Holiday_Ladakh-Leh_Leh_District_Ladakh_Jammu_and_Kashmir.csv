ladakh,We had a booking in Royal Holiday for 3 days and our experience is just awesome. It's  like home away from home. The view from the hotel rooms was just mind blowing. Rooms were clean. All the staffs were very helpful. Even at 6 am they provided our breakfast. The most important part was food. Food quality was just awesome.,Champ,/Profile/pikuchamp13,,50

ladakh,"I emailed the property because nobodyâ€™s answering their phone that I am going to arrive late from Kargil. Unfortunately, the bus that I took ran out of gas so my arrival was further delayed. I arrived in the property past 1 am. I tried to enter the hotel but the gate was locked. I tried hard to at least get the attention of the staff by knocking the gate but no one cared. I called their number and heard it ringing from the outside of the gate but no one bothered to answer it. I gave up and decided to look for another hotel. Unfortunately, all nearby hotels were also closed. I tried to knock, pressed the doorbells and I did everything but no one is awake in all nearby properties. The temperature was at -3 degrees celsius. It was below zero and it was freezing. I felt like my body",Glentoy,/Profile/Glentoy,"Davao City, Philippines",10

ladakh,"Overall this hotel is good if you want hygienic hotel in good price. I stayed in this hotel from 27th August 2017 to 2nd September (off peak season). Following were Pros 1) Room was spacious with balcony having direct view of stok kangri snow capped mountain. 2) Bathroom were spacious and clean. 3) It is on Changspa road so you get many restaurants near by. 4) Food in hotel and service was excellent. 5) It is just at a walk-able distance from main market, it would be pleasure to walk in market every evening. 6) Manager and Staff was very helpful. They took care of my needs diligently. 7) Most of travel agencies which arrange shared taxi's around to Nubra valley or pangong or other places very near by.

Royal Holiday Ladakh is recently built property, it was their first season while we visited ladakh, very well maintained property. I think they deserve more guests based on their service and location. They got Best Location (on changspa road), near by good restaurants (La La Piazzetta) and cafes, they have good parking space. We also find rooms are very comfortable, clean, specially we got best view from our room gallery. Specially Hotel Manager (sushant) was really supportive and all room services were very prompt and on time.

ladakh,"Very good hotel with helpful and hospitable staff. The deluxe room was clean, comfortable and with a nice bathroom with hot shower.  The hotel has also a good location close to main market and restaurants. Please note that in this period due to a local company that is doing works in Champsa road is very difficult and dangerous to get to the hotel. ",Solange,/Profile/sol13_11,"Milan, Italy",40
ladakh,"Amazing place to reside in Leh main area .. The place is very nearby to Leh main bazaar where u can access everything you need , desire , wish to fulfill your trip to Leh . Great hospitality by staff and the owner himself who is a very kind and soft hearted person . I had n amazing experience staying there . There is no place for car washing if you are travelling by your own vehicle but remember Leh is a very clean city , and that's the main reason that hotel doesn't have that facility and I completely agree with that , there are designated car washing compounds where you can do so , please keep Leh and its properties clean . The people are really genuine and friendly that will make your stay all the more rememberable !! Cheers ",668viveka,/Profile/668viveka,,50
ladakh,"Wow. Well after being sick from Dehli belly and puking out of a bus, and suffering from Altitude sickness, I could not think of a better place to rest my woes away. This hotel was only a year new and was FILLED with comfort and Luxury for the price. They were so accommodating and the food was also great. I would recommend this place for a higher end budget for sure. But even for what I'm used to in the States, it was nothing cost wise :)",giovannas247,/Profile/giovannas247,"San Diego, California",50

ladakh,We stayed here for a week from 21st to 27th May. Very new hotel with everything that u need. Cozy bed; neat bathroom; 24 hrs of hot water; perfect room heaters which makes your stay truly comfortable. Located strategically just minutes walk from the main market. Our stay here was made special by the staff who were always there to help with a smile. Our trip was organised by MMT but the hotel Manager Sushant went out of the way each time to fulfill our requests. MMT mostly had veg on their set menu but Hotel staffs  went ahead and prepared non veg only for 2 of us just to satiate our cravings. Even the house keeping and restaurant staff were amazing; specially Sunil who always ensured that we ate well.Each day after a tiring trip we came back to this hotel which welcomed us just,Titlic,/Profile/Titlic,Kolkata,50
