ladakh,"I visited Leh for 7 days using the services of Saleem (the guesthouse owner) both in accommodation and on rental cars. I was very impressed with this trip from the first day of arrival until the day of return. Saleem takes care of us very much. Ree-yul Guest House is comfortable accommodation and good value for money.Every member in the house is very friendly. During my stay there, Exactly on Saleem's wedding day. I congratulate to Saleem. If there is a chance I will definitely go back to using his service.",Siriporn J,/Profile/siripornj434,"Chonburi, Thailand",50

ladakh,"We were three friends who came to Leh without a prior booking and after what felt like ages (especially when you've logged 13 hours of bus travel), we found Ree-yul. We got the amazing room with an attached bath in the terrace for a great price without having to bargain. The proprietor uncle was even willing to give us an extra bedding at no extra cost but it turned out that the bed was big enough for three.  While my friends went on to Srinagar, I carried on travelling within Ladakh and I kept coming back to Ree-yul every second/third day without prior booking. I even kept my rucksack with them. Since there were no single rooms available though, I checked myself into the double rooms with the shared baths and as long as you take care (read: cleanliness), the shared bathrooms",llleslly,/Profile/llleslly,Asia,50

ladakh,"I was in Leh in June with a group of friends and we were looking for something easy on our pockets and in close proximity to the heart of the city. Reeyul was not our first choice since we wanted to stay in Jigmet Guesthouse on a recommendation from a friend. But we did not find any rooms. A local suggested Reeyul Guesthouse and to our delight we were not disappointed. It is 5mins walk from the main market, rooms are clean, staff was friendly and most of all it matched our budget. Overall a great place to stay. Highly recommended if you're not a stickler for the more expensive hotels.",Kuwaiti5,/Profile/Kuwaiti5,"New Delhi, India",40

ladakh,"Simple look from outside, but you can feel the most welcome when you first step inside. I stayed ah this guesthouse for 2 times, first time on november 2014 and june 2015. The owner was always helpful for everything. The accommodations were so comfortable. It is very near to the main bazar, but it is pretty quiet place differently from the noisy street outside. They have many types of room up to your requirement, even you come with couples, family or alone. There are single room with bathroom and single room with shared bedroom with cheaper price. They will usually keep your clean and cozy. Their laundry service is pretty nice. The staff and the owner are very friendly. The easy way to book the room is to call them, becuz you can ask and them for what you want. To contact",Sirilak J,/Profile/sirilakj2014,"Bangkok, Thailand",50
ladakh,"We stayed in Reeyul in August 2014.   Everything about the guest house is really nice. Cozy rooms and very good service deliver great value for money. Saleem was extremely accommodating. In fact we had booked a ground floor room (which is cheaper) and he moved us to a first floor room because it had begun to get a bit cold when we got there and he told us that the rooms on top were warmer. This was done at no extra charge.   We traveled from Leh to Pangong and Nubra (stayed in these places overnight) and he was kind enough to hold the same room for us when we were away for those nights. The staff is also very helpful. Every time we would come back to Leh from any of our destinations, it felt like we were coming back home. The location is also great as it is centrally located.

ladakh,"We heard about the hospitality of the Ree-Yul GH hosts from Thai's Social website and have decided to book the room and taxi services in advance for couple months prior to our stay. Ree-Yul GH services are great as expected. We feel safe and comfort like staying at our home. The most impression is Mr.Saleem and his family hospitality. He also arranged us the taxi services with experienced driver yet reasonable prices. We stayed there for 5 nights and Mr.Saleem treated us the dinner in the last night before we departed, which could say the best meal than any restaurant in Leh. Highly recommended if you are looking for accomodation in Leh.",Yrainoi,/Profile/Yrainoi,Bangkok,50
ladakh,"Located at Hemis Complex in Leh, this is a basic guest house only recommended for budget travellers. The rooms are aren't as clean as one would want but its doable. Breakfast and tea/ coffee is the only meal available at the guest house however there is an option of room delivery. Just ask the man Friday!. The bathrooms are small but you get running hot water 24*7.   If traveling on a budget, I would recommend this place. If traveling with family on a budget, I would not recommend this place.",ankit a,/Profile/ankitagarwalDelhi,"New Delhi, India",30

ladakh,"Tucked in a little alley, sandwiched between two other hotels, Ree Yul is a simple budget place with friendly hosts. In an ideal central location near the Main Bazaar, it is away from the croiwds and main tourist hotels, so great if you want to get away from it all. It has a nice little garden, a simple menu and modest rooms. Rooms range from singles with a shared bathroom to ample doubles with attached bathrooms. The water is hot and nowadays, with the new hydro providing electricity from Alchi, powercuts are now much a thing of the past. Open only during the summer months (like most hotels in Ladakh), you will receive a warm welcome. Many travellers stay for days even weeks, and come back again and again.",KathmanduMazza,/Profile/KathmanduMazza,"Nice, France",40

ladakh,"I was staying at Ree- Yul Guest House for about 10 nights in June 2012. This guest house locates nearby main market, but it doesn't face to big road, so it is really quiet place.  The room of this guest house was well cleaned and neat and hot shower was available everyday(but not 24 hurs). The owner family was really helpful and on the first day I reached, they made me a traditional Ladakhi tea and bread. It was nice experience for me.  The room rate starts from 250rps/night to about 700rps depends on the facility... I think it is worth staying at this guest house in Leh if you want to save money and stay comfortably.   I am planning to go to Leh again in this Sep. and would like to stay here again.",inekichi,/Profile/inekichi,"Fukuoka, Japan",40
