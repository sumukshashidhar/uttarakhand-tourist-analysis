Stunning views of the Himalayas, great walks and a Himalayan Prana-laden river nearby, fresh organic local food, many opportunities for group gathering or solo time.",Shreya,/Profile/yogaisbliss,,40

ladakh,"On my 2nd stay in Ladakh in August 2016, I've been delighted to live a 3-week Yoga-Meditation-Chanting retreat at No-Mind Guesthouse in company of 23 friends from over the globe. I highly recommend that place to those in quest of tranquillity and serenity... added to the legendary kindness of the Ladakhi people. The Himalayan surroundings are amongst the most stunning in the world with early morning invite to the nearby Gompa or monastery for Shanti visit or silent sitting. Those who love breathing the purest air, walking in breathtaking wilderness, dreaming along small enchanting rivers, resting under apricot & apple trees will be absolutely happy!",Aseema T,/Profile/468aseemat,Mauritius,40
ladakh,"I'm writing this review 2 years later. A fantastic stay with plenty of super cool memories, breathtaking walks, and tranquil scenery... deserves a mention. And I'm confident your stay here too, will resemble similar experience. It's the kind of place where you chill for a long time and get work done. Whatever ""work"" means to you. This is where you do it amidst fine food, privacy, solitude and walks for self-contemplation.",Andre V,/Profile/marksA8485UV,"Byron Bay, Australia",50

ladakh,The quality & facilities of this retreat center & guesthouse are hard to come by in Ladakh. On the outskirts of a very quaint traditional village next to a stunning monastery the surrounding views & ambience are perfect to support any style of retreat.,chetanabyron,/Profile/chetanabyron,"Byron Bay, Australia",40
ladakh,I met with another 20 new women at the Centre for a retreat with a real heart. We loved the Centre and it was hard to leave.  Each room looks across to the mountain view and has its own bathroom. It's an easy walk to Likir monastery and sitting by the river nearby was a favorite with us all. ,Melissa T,/Profile/522melissat,"Sydney, Australia",40
ladakh,"This is one of the gems of Ladakh, set in a beautiful quiet village with stunning mountain views. Great walks in the area, and an awesome yoga and meditation hall make this perfect for retreats and groups. ",Russell_YakTrak,/Profile/Russell_YakTrak,"Byron Bay, Australia",50
