ladakh,The campus was beautiful with a huge lawn and a small stream flowing through the middle of the property. Food was good and the camps were basic but had all amenities. Each cottage got a sitting area along with an attached washroom.   WIfi was also there but hardly had any coverage and was pretty slow when available.,Saion,/Profile/saionc2018,"Kolkata, India",40
ladakh,Excellent location of camp having round the year river flows in between the camp. Food is also excellent. Only part that hurts is hygiene of tent which is quite below the standard but location of property covers it all.  Electricity is available 7-11 PM only and mobile network is weak.,Shrenik J,/Profile/ShrenikJ38,,40
ladakh,"Its gem. Very comfortabe tents with all requird amenities. Perfect tap hot water and fantastic homely food. The entire resort is surronded by superb nature - water stream, greenary and hills around. The icing on cake is they put up campfire (with live steamming on big screen). Imagine, live FIFA world cup match at night .. live on big screen with campfire .. in Numbra valley .... Its ultimate..",harshit301,/Profile/harshit301,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,I checked In on 28th April 2018. Arun was an amazing host. He even helped us by giving us a lip lotion since our lips was torn due to the cold. The food spread was huge. Hospitality was awesome. The camp looked just like the pic it is very nice and heater bed was really good. There are timing for electricity. Wifi is weak. I will definitely stay here again. ,Pavitra C,/Profile/944pavitrac,"Singapore, Singapore",40
ladakh,"Our group of 6 traveled to Hunder Village during April,  which is before the high season for visitors. Due to this fact,  we had the entire camp to ourselves for two nights, which only added to the serenity. The friendly staff spoke great English and honored our reservations, even though they were still preparing the camp for the summer. The double (soft!) beds have heated blankets in them, so we were comfortable sleeping in the April chill. The bathrooms (see photo) have outlets in them as well as the bedroom. The hot water for bathing and electricity was only available to us at certain times during the morning and evening, however, but since we were out most of the day we barely noticed. The breakfasts (which cost a little extra) were amazing, complete with various items,",emstravel52,/Profile/emstravel52,,50

ladakh,The tents were definitely the best we had seen in Ladak. A separate sitting room followed by the main bedroom and then the bathroom. Quite spacious with clean blankets. We did not feel cold. The dunes are only 15 mins by car. Please carry all your medicines and essentials as this is a remote location. The nearest hospital is an army run round 20-30 mins by car. The staff were very polite and helpful.  The food was average.,Payaltalk,/Profile/Payaltalk,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"We stayed here for a night here.  the tents were well constructed - we did not feel cold. instead felt very comfortable and had a wonderfully good and comfortable night of sleep in camp.  Food in the buffet was decent. However, an incident dampened our experience here somewhat. They could not offer us a plate of simple khichdi for my wife who was very unwell and had been advised to have a simple meal; The khichdi they finally gave us was still spicy and oily and of course she could not eat more than a few spoons of it.  Basically, in these kind of places do not expect any sort of extra customized service. As long as its standard buffet fare, all is good.  The tents had a double room / split compartment with the front lounge compartment separated from the bed/bunk; this was quite",PrinceAnuraagMishra,/Profile/PrinceAnuraagMishra,"Kolkata, India",30
ladakh,"Its one of the most beautiful place as far as luxury tents are concerned. Right mod way of property , glacier water / river is providing fresh potable water. On the same bank you  can pick apricots if you are there in season. Overall awesome place. ",Prasad Thosar,/Profile/prasad9899,"Pune, India",40

ladakh,"Very peaceful with great views and a small stream flowing through the camp.Comfortable tents with attached bathrooms and hot water(in morn).  Electricity comes only at night for 2-3 hours and in morn for an hour or so, but think its same in all the camps in hunder.  Excellent staff who look after all your requirements to make the stay comfortable. Food is basic but good and tasty.",Sbhu,/Profile/Sbhu,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
ladakh,"This is the Perfect Camp for sinking into beauty of nature, falling deep in love with the serenity of the valley and when one hears the sound of water passing by in those small streams adds colours to your stay! Such amazing owner - so humble and kind and the staffs so polite with their on call services ever ready! Everything was designed and placed so simply yet so beautifully from those mini bridges to the bonfire place. Thank You Royal Deluxe Camp for making our stay so comfortable hoping to be there soon!",Deach2019,/Profile/Deach2019,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"When we went to Nubra Valley, this was the chosen place to stay overnight.   The camp is located almost at the end of the village. There are also a lot of hotels and guest houses with cemented accommodation so we were wondering why our travel partner has booked us in a camp.  The approach road to the camp is very narrow and one has to drive with caution. Overspending is anyways something that I don't really encourage. Once you enter this camp, you can park your vehicle and the resort manager would come to greet you.  After that, he took us to our tents and thats when we realised the true beauty of the place. There is a small stream running inside the entire resort dividing it into 2. There are various points where they've constructed bridges to cross the stream. There are a few",Abhi S,/Profile/791abhis,,40
ladakh,I had booked a camp next to Royal Deluxe Camp in Nubra Valley. When I checked-in my camp I realized that we (I and my wife) were the only two guests who had booked for that night. We immediately cancelled our booking and started exploring other options. It was already late in the evening and we were running late for our bacterian camel ride. This is when we found Royal Deluxe Camp and it was bustling with people. We were fortunate to get a deluxe tent as this was the only one which was available. The manager was very helpful and immediately checked us in and provided some evening snacks and tea. The tents were royally decorated and appeared premium. The bathroom area is made of concrete and that is the only portion of tent which can be locked through a lock and key. Thankfully,KumarAnupam,/Profile/KumarAnupam,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"What to say about the beauty about this place as you will found the best possible natural stay. I love about them that they did not modified things to spoil the beautiful and natural atmosphere here. Mountains at one side and trees everywhere. They have big open area and water going from inside the campus of it which makes it more awesome. They have made tent and put double bed, one table, one chair, a pair of sleeper inside. The attached bathroom is made by solid concrete which is having shower, tap, a bucket, english toilet and wash basin.   Staff is very welcoming and ready to help. I love the food as they have good taste and variety to serve. Some of them can't speak good hindi but this is not a big problem.

ladakh,"Never having the chance to have stayed in tents, this was an excellent opportunity to experience the feeling. I have to admit that staying at RDC was in fact ""royal"" because it exceeded our expectations in terms of facilities. We stayed their for two nights and it was a treat!  Amenities: There was a double-sized bed with a proper toilet at the back of the tent. They even provided the electric blankets that could warm your bed beforehand! The tents are spacious and quite clean as well.There is also a stream flowing within the camp that gives a natural touch to the whole place.  Location:  The location is also great and it's just a 10-min ride to the Sand dunes and a 15-min ride to the Diskit monastery.   Activities: Apart from visiting the sand dunes and the monastery, we went",Saloni J,/Profile/salonij608,"Hong Kong, China",50
ladakh,Location: On the main road and lots of camp around. You will be able to find it.  Tents: Tents are spacious and very clean. A nice stream flows through the camp. Total of about 30 tents are present. Toilet inside the tent. basic lights and charging point available. Food: It was tasty and you will not complain. Value for money: Good for the setting.  We were a group of bikers and enough parking place available. ,AbhijitKhatu,/Profile/AbhijitKhatu,"Thane, Maharashtra, India",50
ladakh,"We stayed here for 2 nights via Heena Tours and were quite satisfied with the stay. The Camp is about a 10 minute drive to the Sand Dunes.  The Camp has a beautiful setup as a fresh water stream flows right through the middle dividing the Camp into two areas. There are plenty of trees and small bridges to cross the stream.  There are 2 types of tents here (A & B). I would recommend the ones near to the stream (B) as they're more shaded by trees in the daytime and the view from them is better than those away from the stream.  The tents are large and bathrooms are ok. The overall cleanliness is also not as great as that of closed rooms. It could get very hot within the tents on a clear day, so try not to be indoors in the afternoon. The rooms are provided with electrical bed",Rahul Ajmera,/Profile/rahulajmera,"Pune, India",40
ladakh,"This is our 3rd visit to this camp in 2013, 2014 and 2015 because we love it so much. From Leh, you will head off up the Khardung La and then down into the Nubra Valley. Generally a 6-8 hour trip one way depending on traffic build up on the cliff ledge tracks and landslides etc. Great tents, atmosphere, surrounding views, food, hot water, attached toilets, showers. Natural environment with apricot trees and glacial stream from the Lasermo glacier. Bear in mind it is a camp site at a valley bottom at 3084m in the Indian Himalayas so there will be temperature fluctuations. Staff are happy to give you extra blankets and hot drinks if required. There are many camp sites in Hundar (posh and pretentious) but this one has a good feel factor to it. If you want super duper city-type",YSealFamily,/Profile/YSealFamily,United Kingdom,50
ladakh,Had a good camping experience at Nubra. The staff is very generous. Tents are good with good double bed. Attached bathroom is concrete one. There is a water flow by the tents which makes this place very beautiful. They arranged for a bon fire for us in the night. Food was ok.,Travelfreak2401,/Profile/Travelfreak2401,,40
