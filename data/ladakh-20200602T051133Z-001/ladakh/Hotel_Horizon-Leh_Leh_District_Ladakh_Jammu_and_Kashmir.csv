ladakh,"Very poor service. No wifi connectivity even after complaint nobody was there to listen. In the morning breakfast they ask any one option to choose. Whenever we go for eat, evrerytime we wait approx half an hour. No landline facility, Even the bed matress quality very poor. Sleeping over there is very tough. No street light front of hotel. Evening time we always brought flashlight to go market. I m totally disappointed.",nirbhay s,,,20

ladakh,"Hotel Horizon, Leh, can be best described as a lower end, budget transit Hotel. We stayed there for three nights in July / August 2017, stopping over on the way to Nubra, Pangong Lake and return to Delhi. Located on a bye lane off a shopping area, it is walking distance from the main market. The bye lane does not have street lights, and you need to carry your torch if you venture out in the evening.   The Hotel has no view, but it otherwise well constructed, though some lapses in upkeep are showing. The lounge is very small, but otherwise Ok for the class of Hotel.There is nice sit out to bask in the Sun. The small grounds are otherwise nice and green,  The rooms are minimally furnished but airy and the toilets are spacious. The TV only has some Hindi Channels. Maintenance is",gautam_roy1949,,"Kolkata, India",20
