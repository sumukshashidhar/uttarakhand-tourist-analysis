ladakh,"Thanks for the great hospitality! The guest house is conveniently situated right beside the main street. I think it's a new guest house hence not many facilities like other grand hotels, but that's what you've paid for! The internet is not working inside our room but with a few steps of walking to the common area, it's working just fine. There is no electricity during our stay, not before the evening, and I'm having high altitude sickness so it's really kind of suffer but thanks to the great hospitality, the owner tried their best to host me by providing hot water, hot butter tea and that's what I need. Big thanks to Anshah! This is a basic room but rest assure it's very comfortable with big room, big washroom and thick blankets provided! I feel warm at night :)",bellybearybell,/Profile/BellNg,Ipoh,50
