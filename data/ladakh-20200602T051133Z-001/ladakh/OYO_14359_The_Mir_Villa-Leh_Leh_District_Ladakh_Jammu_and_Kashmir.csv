ladakh,"We vistited Ladakh in November 2017, so most Guest Houses where already closed.  Fortunatly ""the Mir Villa"" ist opened the entire year. The staff is incredibly friendly and caring, with amazing food for breakfast and dinner (we skipped lunch).  The room was very cozy and tidy and as a pleasant surprise we even had warm water and a heating radiator that kept the room at a bearable temperature at night.  The best experience was probably the dinner, because the food was amazing and we took it with Nazir and his family, who are very nice and guest friendly people.  You add this up with the stunning landscape around leh and the fact that the pricing was very low for european standarts and you have the best stay for a visit in ladakhs capital city.

ladakh,"When the Leh city almost shuts  down for its annual winter session, there will be very few hotels will be available for the extreme adventurers who visits there,  This is one among that. Neat and clean with room heaters inside every room and a dining  hall. Over all total worth stay here.",HarshaBhat,/Profile/HarshaBhat,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,"Very nice place to stay,  very helpful cooperative people. Location wise a little away from leh market. But still the hospitality is excellent. The food is like home made & tasty.  The Kahwa is made in front of you in the most authentic way. Overall a nice homely surrounding. ",santanu,/Profile/Santanu_2433,"Kolkata, India",40
ladakh,"Phew! Where do I start? Well, the trip to Leh was in planning for quite sometime. 3 blokes from Goa on motorcycles to the world's most amazing landscapes. Leh being the base for everything we wanted to see and do, a friend recommended Mir Villa. So we arrived on the 26th of June, dusty and tired, riding from Lamayuru. Slightly starving for oxygen and more for some good food and a 'home like' place to stay.  So after wading through the streets of Fort Road, Nazir found us and welcomed us to his humble and beautiful abode.  There we were introduced to Shishpal - the world's best Butler!   We arrived during Lunch time and it was Eid! Lucky us, Naizr the boss, treated us to some delicious home cooked Eid Special food in the traditional dining hall.  The room was everything we",JoelMumbai,/Profile/JoelMumbai,"Goa, India",50
ladakh,"Stayed at the Mir Villa, Ladhak in the first week of July. Highly recommend- clean rooms, all necessary amenities available and great service levels! Easy approach to Leh market which makes the evenings even more fun!  ",Vishal J,/Profile/VishalJ678,,50
ladakh,"I visited Leh from 03 Jun to 11 Jun 17. I had booked 02 rooms and Innova class vehicle for the full trip with Mir Villa, Mr Nazir a month in advance. To my surprise nothing was tied up and I was asked about the full program again a day prior to, I was to start my journey. I took an early morning flight to Leh and had not slept the whole night before, so I was very tired. We were picked up in Ecco class vehicle from Airport and were made to wait at Mir Villa for 1 hr before we could enter our rooms. We were dead tired and wanted to just sleep, so we quickly changed and slept without having anything. At around 1500 hrs, staff of Mir Villa started banging the door of our rooms, to which I got up and opened the door and before I could catch up on my breath the man started shouting",Max M,/Profile/amitmehta041,"Panchkula, India",10
ladakh,"Me and 3 friends went to Ladakh 25-30th March 2017 and stayed at Mir Villa. Our hosts Nazir and his lovely wife Naheeda and their two helpers (husband&wife team) Chispal and Yoshada attended to us with such warmth and kindness and generosity. Food was great, ambience nice and cosy. You feel so much at home. In the evenings, we would all gather at the dining/living area sharing stories and jokes. And their 6-year old daughter Norhaiza is such a sweet darling.  Both well educated , Nazir and Naheeda communicate with us in perfect English .   Since we came to Ladakh during end of winter when the temp was still pretty chilly at 4 degrees, we were provided with portable heater in the room. Flat screen tv with cable channels . The toilets have modern facilities, with proper shower",dolphinsearcher,/Profile/dolphinsearcher,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",50
ladakh,For me travelling is spending time with local people in that place so that you can see how people live what is their cultural profile and how they spend time everyday...Best part about this place is i got the chance to eat the owners family everyday they were very hospitable and humble. Feels really gud when you get this kind of hospitality. I would love to stay here again.,Apoorv B,/Profile/582apoorvb,,50
ladakh,"We stayed at Mir Villa during the winter and the place felt really like home with lots of warm smiles, tender care, and hearty delicious meals everyday. Everyone is so friendly and genuine. We were stuck in Leh for two days due to bad weather but everytime we returned to the hotel, we felt like coming home again. I will miss our meals in the cozy kitchen and the fantastic views from room and from the roof-top. Strongly recommend this place for anyone, family to solo travellers.",SingaporeChicken,/Profile/SingaporeChicken,SingaporeChicken,50
ladakh,"From the moment we arrived the atmosphere was so relaxed and everybody there was so kind, unlimited hot drinks (which helps a lot when its -22 outside) and the care and attention by everyone to make sure you are ok its outstanding.  Rooms are spotless and bed is very comfortable. Toilet is also spotless. Room has everything you need. Location is great only a short walk from the main market and a few of the main tourist attractions!   The homemade food was the best food we have had in India in our month travelling. So fresh and tasty and the husband and wife who make it couldn't be nicer people! They even let me help them cook one night so I could take down the recipe.   My favourite part of our three night stay was sitting having dinner in the evening talking to the whole family",DaniB123456,/Profile/DaniB123456,"London, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"What an amazing place. If you want a truly natural and friendly  experience then I recommend  The Mir Villa . The staff are all amazing and very helpful, and the chefs OMG the food is first class. This villa  is not commercialized in any way and you get to see the mesmeric brown mountains and the Leh palace glittering  in the  sun, from the roof top , where you could spend a quite evening after sightseeing ,sipping coffee and watching the sun set behind the hills .  The hotel is a peaceful 10 min walk from the main market. ( which I loved, as you get time to catch up with your self )   Without a doubt I will be returning :)  A massive Thank you to all the staff and family for making my experience exceptional with their warm gestures .",sarahsE8812FT,/Profile/sarahsE8812FT,,50
ladakh,"I stayed there for 3 nights after Chadar trek. I simply loved the place because of the homely atmosphere. A peaceful cozy stay it was. They took utmost care to ensure a comfortable stay for everyone even in the crazy winter. Food is delicious. Rooms are tidy with comfortable clean warm bed, clean bathrooms. The highlight is the dining area where I used to spend whole evening. Nothing can be better than having conversation over tea (chai) and when the tea is unlimited & complimentary, it makes the day. They offer unlimited tea (variety of teas in fact) as compliment.  The first thing anyone would notice is their hospitality. I would definitely stay there when I will go to Leh again.",paromita2709,/Profile/paromita2709,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,"we stayed here 2 nights before heading into Hemis National Park and one night after departing the park.  We had a beautiful sunlit room, spotlessly clean and the bed was comfortable and warm. The food was great and home made, the service terrific with all our needs met.  In addition, the friendly family atmosphere was a delight but never an intrusion. The location was quiet and peaceful.",Cheryl S,/Profile/549cheryls,"Fairbanks, Alaska",50
ladakh,"When the town Leh get closed for its winter session and crazy tourists and trekker seek for a warm shelter in sub zero temperature, this is one of the best option. We stayed here for around 6 days and experienced the very good hospitality of the owner and the staff. In winter most of the Leh hotels will experience the shortage of water due to freezing water supply pipes. But here we never faced such issues. On a relaxing / acclimatization  day you can have a cup of Kashmir Quawha tea and enjoy the surrounded mountains view from here.    This hotel is little bit far away from the main market but well connected with the main road. Other than this is a very good hotel to stay in",HarshaBhat,/Profile/HarshaBhat,"Bengaluru, India",40
