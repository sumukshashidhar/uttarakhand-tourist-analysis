For various complicated reasons, we ended up staying here on 3 occasions in 3 different rooms during our month in Ladakh. We were made to feel most welcome each time. Every room we had was spacious,bright, clean,  and comfortable, with hot showers in the attached  modern bathrooms.   The manager is thoroughly professional and the staff are all friendly and really do their best, but are not necessarily familiar with the requirements of European visitors. However they responded positively to all our requests and were so kind and so anxious to please that one could forgive any little misunderstandings.    The restaurant was fine with a good cooked breakfast and other meals whenever required.  It was nice",HighfieldLadies,/Profile/HighfieldLadies,"Hampshire, England",40
ladakh,"Located in a small bylane leading to the centre of town, this hotel has a small, clean central courtyard with a large garden umbrella and a few chairs.  The rooms are quite clean and spacious.  Bathrooms are clean.  The staff are quite courteous and friendly.   The exterior is not very impressive, but once inside, it is peaceful.  I dont recommend the room closest to the lane, since it can get very noisy in the morning, with people talking and the sound of motor vehicles going by.  The food is good.  The rooms in the upper floor are better than the ones on the first floor.",Gopalakrishna H,/Profile/trekkerMangalore,"Mangalore, India",30

ladakh,"Leh is a place you really can't forget - ever in life! It is a once in a lifetime experience. But an experience that doesn't come easy - altitude sickness, lack of appetite and general fatigue are high. Which means the hotel you choose becomes very important to the overall experience.   We were happy to choose Hotel Pangong. The place is very conveniently located, at walking distance from the central market area, which is great since walking is not very easy in the Leh weather. The staff at the hotel was very warm and friendly, they really made you feel comfortable. I must make a mention that my partner got fever while we were at the hotel and the staff went out of their way to help out.   The rooms were decent, but no major luxuries out there - suffice it to say that the",arpitab,/Profile/arpitab,"Pune, India",40
