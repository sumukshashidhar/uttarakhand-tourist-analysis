ladakh,"A no frills family run hotel. Nice cosy rooms, attached bathrooms with hot water from the solar powered geysers. Wonderful hosts who do their best to please. The menu is rather limited but OK. There is enough parking area within the compound.A value for money place and is recommended.",Rinchen W,/Profile/bobbywangdi,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,We had a night stay here. Rooms were clean. Toilets were also clean but the toilet roof had a small leak. Food was good. Good hospitality. Not too far from the sand dunes.This is located at the base of the mountain.,vinay_galactus,/Profile/vinay_galactus,"Wakad, India",40
ladakh,"This is a very basic guest house in Hunder in Nubra Valley. Clean Rooms, nice bed and clean toilets. But no running hot water. Curtains are a bit too thin for my liking and it affects privacy. Food options are also very limited, only non veg item available was eggs. The location is great just below a mountain and close to all the sights of Nubra Valley. But for 2200 its a bit expensive, considering it was off season in Ladakh.",sudipnandy,/Profile/sudipnandy,"Kolkata, India",30

ladakh,"A small but very good and maintained guest house in HUNDER. The rooms and washrooms are well maintained. The lady owner is concerned for her visitors. The food especially RAJMA CHAWAL , ALOO PARANTHA are very spicy nd tasty especially when u r away at a distance of 1404 km from ur place (Delhi). The rate of 900 INR with triple bed is pocket friendly. Yes ,the bargain of price can be done as per the season.It has got apple trees too in the guest house. :)",shahhdeepak9493,/Profile/shahhdeepak9493,"New Delhi, India",50
