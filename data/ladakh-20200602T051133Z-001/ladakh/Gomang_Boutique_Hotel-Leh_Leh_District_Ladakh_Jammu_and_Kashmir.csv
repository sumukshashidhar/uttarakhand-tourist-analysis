ladakh,"This is your option in Leh. The hotel is located 15 min from the airport along a stream that'll lull you to sleep, yet you'll be 10 minutes from the backpacker restaurants in town. The view from the roof is postcard perfect, just below Shanti Stupa. The service is excellent, comparable to multi-star establishments, and the staff is responsive to all sorts of requests. The kitchen is well-run. The breakfast buffet is simple but sufficient. Good coffee and tea with fruit and Indian fare. The kitchen really shone with Indian fare dinner individually requested on the second floor veranda at late night ""byob"" evening discussions with other guests.

As of now, I am unsure how the new rules will shape up this region but what I am sure about is I’ll try and be there every year (which I have been doing for the past 3 years now).   1st trip to Leh (back in 2016) was more from the fascination point of view (let’s do it before you die types), 2nd time it was a choice, 3rd time it was a need. Never knew an unknow terrain could bring calmness/ happiness to my soul.

From the word go, from the time we landed on KBR airport at Leh to the drop off at the departure 3 days later, every moment of our stay was comfortable, safe and enjoyable.

While booking itself Mr Gurnam Singh ji helped in chalking out a good itinerary. This is a hotel where you find every single staff member smiling and trying to ensure that you have a great holiday. On the forefront is Gurnam Singh ji himself who strikes a personal rapport. It is essential that one gets acclimatised to the conditions in Ladakh and this needs 24 to 48 hours. We started our sight seeing post 24 hours and enjoyed thoroughly. There is ample scope for the Government to improve tourism here.

ladakh,"Leh, Ladakh, is an unusual place.  It has a great scenic setting: a lot of things to see, do, etc.;  a lot of snow/ice covered mountainous area - as a matter of fact, the Pangong lake was completely frozen when we visited it in March.  Unfortunately, however, one has to take proper care, because the oxygen content is very low in the atmosphere - the total air pressure itself drops to 2/3 at 11,500 feet (at Leh) and 1/2 at 18,000 feet (at Chang La pass through which one has to go to reach the lake).  The fact that there is no vegetation in Leh (unlike in usual hill resorts like Ooty and Kodaikanal) makes this problem acute.

ladakh,I am an extensive traveller and hence have stayed at many places around the world...but for the first time I feel compelled to write a review. There are places/ hotels which you deserve but  here is a Hotel i.e. Gomang Boutique Hotel which decides whether you are deserving of the place or not.  If you ever felt like carrying your home with you for a trip...this is the hotel for you. If you ever felt like making new friends in a trip...this is the hotel for you. If you ever felt like doing that something extra after the site seeing is over and the city goes to sleep (like playing poker or dumb charades with newly found friends in my case) ....this is the hotel for you. You need that extra bit of a care at a place like Leh which this hotel is ever ready to provide. Great staff,700vickya,/Profile/700vickya,,50

These guys know what they are doing and how service industry works. 4. Large spread of quality food - they can even open restaurant :) 5. Well organized trip with experienced drivers. 6. Clean rooms and bathrooms , comparable to international standards.  All this comes together because of the owner (Gurnam Ji) . He knows the place , people & route as no one else.

Certainly more like what the real Tibet would be like now if the Chinese hadn't continued their complete and utter destruction of Tibet and it's people since 1950. The Dalai Lama is a frequent visitor and helps keep traditional Buddhist practices alive. The hotel is not just a place to sleep - it is a place to philosophise and meditate and the while the food is delicious , foyer music first class and the rooms very comfortable - what you get out of staying at a place like Hotel Gomang is more than that.
