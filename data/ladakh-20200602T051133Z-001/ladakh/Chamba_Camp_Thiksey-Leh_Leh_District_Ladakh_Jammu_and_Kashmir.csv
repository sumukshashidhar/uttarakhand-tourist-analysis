ladakh,"Was in Chamba Camp during Aug 2019 for 5 Days, Leh which in itself is a great holiday destination was made Perfect with my stay at Chamba, spent my first 5 days in Leh doing sight seeing and later checked into Chamba Camp  The co-operation they extended to help me surprise my wife impressed me, they took care details of even removing the name from the pick-up vehicle, perfect co-ordination thanks for that.  Located right on the Leh Manali highway yet so isolated and calm place, attention to details for everything to make the stay just perfect and relaxing.   Special mention of our Guide Mr. Jigmet whose knowledge of place and Buddhism was very informative and as person very humble and down to earth.   I would highly recommend this place to relax and unwind from busy city life.",Hampi,/Profile/hampiholi,,50
ladakh,"I still can't understand why we paid so much for staying in this camp. Clearly, I would not go back and I can't recommend this place. I have also heard that they are not being fair with their local Ladakhi employees and partners.",Mag,/Profile/Mag1262,,10
ladakh,"We stayed at this camp for our honeymoon. The price is high but we were not really impressed by the camp and the facilities. During our holidays in Ladakh, we also stayed in other hotels which were better and cheaper. Therfore I don’t recommend this camp.",sujeet,/Profile/sujeetbangbang,,20
ladakh,"camp is ok, but it's not so comfortable to stay in a tent when it's little bit cold and windy. I think next time I will choose a real hotel instead of a camp. Staff was professional and friendly and food was fine.",KSS,/Profile/ksshal99,,30
ladakh,"Tents are from South Africa. There is no Ladakhi decoration, no Ladakhi traditional furniture in the tents. We travelled to Ladakh but we didn't feel like we were in Ladakh during our stay at Chamba Camp. It would be better if the place displayed more traditional Ladakhi culture and ambiance. The only thing which finally made us feel that we were in Ladakh was the Ladakhi dance performance in the evening. But it's a performance organised just for tourists, nothing authentic.",CWS,/Profile/CWS2312,,10
ladakh,"Everything about the camp was perfect; the tents, ambience, food and service with special mention o Jemet at reception and waiter, Shabham (hope I have spelt it right). We enjoyed playing a game of croquet. It was lovely to hear the monks chanting from Thiksey monastery in the early morning. It was a pleasure to watch traditional dances while having scrumptious barbecued canapés on our first evening there.",Mita64,/Profile/Mita64,London,50
ladakh,"Photos and website are misleading. I thought the camp was near Thiksey monastery and that I could easily walk to the monastery everyday (for the morning prayer and for meditation). In reality, it takes almost 30 minutes on foot and it’s not safe to walk along the Leh-Manali Highway.",kiki,/Profile/71kiki,,20
ladakh,"We went to Leh Champa Camp the first week of August. Location is wonderful with the Thiksey Monastery view , a romantic garden and luxury tents with everything you can desire. Restaurant with indian and international cuisine. Service very accurate. Only minus wi-fi not available in some rooms and connection quite poor. Compliment to hotel designer and to the staff for the excellent proposal !",Stefano S,/Profile/I5662ZHstefanos,,50
ladakh,"The staff was attentive, Chef was excellent. The effort was there but the feel of the property did not spell luxury as in price !  Ver very impressed with Jigmet of the front office. Was very attentive, efficient, proficient and extruded warmth and created a very comfortable feel !!",Maninder B,/Profile/maninderbolarias,"Chandigarh, India",40
ladakh,"This is a true luxury camp about 19 kms from the Leh airport. The 18 plush tents have heaters, 4 poster beds, plush decor and a comfortable bathroom. It’s a tent with luxury. It comes with a valet. The reception cum lounge is a separate tent as us the dining room. They warm welcome with cold towels and warm kahwa tea is exciting each time. The package we took care with a dedicated car, guide and driver who stayed with us for all 7 days and were knowledgeable and caring folks. The staff is  well trained and responsive. Each meal is separately curated. Their Indian food was better and enjoyable. No liquor is served or allowed as the camp is on the grounds of the Thiksey monastery which forms a great backdrop besides the snow capped mountains. A real delight to be here.",Geeess,/Profile/Geeess,"Rome, Italy",50
ladakh,"We availed of the 7 night Ladakh land package from TUTC and were awe-struck by the experience. The property is away from the hustle and bustle of Leh City, surrounded on one side by snow clad mountains and on the other side by Thicksey monetary.  The camps are truly luxurious - heated bed room and the bathroom, plush bedding and wonderful interiors. The care for guest comfort shows in the choice of toiletries, provision of Kaftan and sun hats. As part of the package, you get a personal valet, a well-informed guide and a chauffeur driven car for all the sight-seeing.  Every meal is a gourmet experience with Chef Uttam cooking multiple kind of delights - special mention to the bakery chef for baking such delicacies in this kind of climate.  Beyond all of this, Chamba Camp scores",Amit Chopra,/Profile/amitchop,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"This is Ultimate Luxury that I have ever experienced . I loved the stay. They do more than they commit. Each member of this camp knows their job. Food they served still tingles on my tongue. I was pampered like anything. I felt I am lying in the lap of Mother Nature, patting me and loving me from core of her heart. This camp is a destination in itself where I would love to go again and again. The feeling was, ""On the Top of the World At the Top of the World"".",Kavita,/Profile/KavitaCh,"Kolkata, India",50
ladakh,"Adding to the incredible geography and breathtaking landscape The Ultimate Travelling Camp creates a beautiful experience. Re built every year , these tents are full of design details that are just delightful. The aesthetic of the entire property is chic while also being very comfortable made more special by wonderful staff ! Here you will find Beautiful furniture , lighting,  bed linen, beautifully designed stationary even the shower cpas were lovely. All the plants and flowers are re grown in time for the season- amazing  . Our stay here was an absolute delight. We cant wait to go back. ",pgaekwar,/Profile/pgaekwar,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Visited Ladakh in June for the fourth time. Decided to camp rather glamp at TUTC Thiksey and this was the most unexpected stay at 11,300 feet! The service levels were impeccable, the food was better than anything I have had in the region before and the stay incredibly amazing. We also visited their camp in Diskit and were taken aback by how they have managed to maintain a high level of luxury to such a desolate yet endearing landscape.",Happiness827470,/Profile/Happiness827470,,50
ladakh,"We want there on my birthday to have lunch at their restaurant ""Cafe Cloud"" and have done a checkout trip to the tents..This is by far the only ELITE place to stay in Leh town.The food was mouthwatering . The chef come out and speak with you at every meal to make sure you were happy was an extra special touch and a surprise Birthday cake was icing on the cake :D",Anoop Shekhawat,/Profile/AnoopS637,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"Chamba Camp Thiksey brings glamping to Leh.  The tents are imported from South Africa and are luxurious, with heating and aircon, wood flooring and en suite bathrooms with running hot water.  Each tent comes with a butler and the restaurant offers excellent service and fairly good food.  Considering that all the other properties in Leh are 3-star at best, this is clearly the best place to stay near Leh at this time.  If you get a chance, select tents with single digit numbers as they are in a better location in the property and have better views.  A couple of new tents are planned for next year and are expected to be less luxurious than the current ones, so selection of tents is important in order to get the best value for money.  Service levels at the property are overall very",V C,/Profile/VC142,,50
ladakh,This is one of the best camp I have stayed in. The tents were extremely neat & could not find a flaw with the same. The hospitality is much better than most for the 5 stars we would have stayed in. The staff was very helpful in organizing local trips & we virtually had one person assigned to take care of our requirements. The food was very tasty and was cooked as per our desire if informed well in advance. All the tents are conveniently placed with a distance to ensure privacy.,Manshri,/Profile/Manshri,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"I celebrated my 32nd birthday in this glamorous camp in Ladakh, and I will never forget the experience. One of the best experience of my life. We took the presidential tent, and it was nothing like I experienced in my life. The people, the place, the tents are on a class of its own. Except for the acclimatisation issue the place was like a chapter from a dream. The first day we just lounged about in the camp, ate gourmet luxury food in the middle of the desert, even though no one will say it’s a desert as the whole place is perfectly bloomed with various birds and multi coloured butterflies. The second day we went for a cycling ride in the villages bordered with paddy fields on one side and golden sun kissed mountains on the other. I couldn’t believe my eyes. After the cycling,",Amani M,/Profile/amani2707,Dhaka,50
ladakh,"The place, people and personalization of the trip was extraordinary. We enjoyed our stay and we couldn't have asked for more. The friendly and courteous staff went out of their way to meet our requirements. It was a memorable holiday, and would like to extend our gratitude to all the staff at the camp for making it so.",abhiramip,/Profile/abhiramip,,50
ladakh,"We stayed for 5 nights, both in the luxury and presidential tents. The tents are some of the best you will get to stay in. The service was very personal and everyone went out of their way to make you feel at home. Our butler, Krishna was attentive to the point of spoiling us. All meals were something to look forward to, the Indian food on the menu was tasty but not heavy, a rare combination. Sightseeing, in and around Leh, was very well arranged by the camp. Our guide Angmo and our chauffeur Stenzing became friends over the 5 days. The only downside if I may add is that the wifi connection is patchy and our checkout billing could have been handled better.  But all in all it's a lap of luxury at 11,500 ft above sea level.",buckletlist,/Profile/buckletlist,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"This place has pure indulgence spelled in all caps. Beautiful tents with fantastic bed, super bathroom and gorgeous sitting area.  Nicely landscaped grounds and excellent à la carte menu restaurant.  Joining the English-American hosts for sundowner cocktails pre-dinner gave this a colonial feel.

ladakh,"First of all, the location of these camps is amazing. Away from the hustle and bustle of the city and you get amazing views of Ladakh mountain range. Thiksey monastery dots the background on one side.  For them to really call themselves luxury tents, they need to improve the food esp breakfast, ensure guests' comfort (our car left a lot to be desired) and learn to listen to feedback. Most of our feedback during and after the stay was ignored and in fact, the senior management sent an email which was outright rude. There were several mishaps during our stay (including food poisoning due to poorly cooked food) and their response was that no one has ever complained.",tripleA_9,/Profile/tripleA_9,Singapore,10
ladakh,"The tents were ultra luxury. All the staff were very humble and nice. Dinner menu was nice, but Breakfast menu has to be improved.  There should be arrangements for the chauffers , since it is away from the town and the approach road has to be constructed. We were not informed so we had to take a turn about and reached the camp , this route was also not good with water logging and no sign marks that leads to the camp.",KolkataKrishna,/Profile/KolkataKrishna,Kolkata,50
ladakh,"We spent a fantastic five nights in the luxurious tents marvelling at the stunning views.  We did have to take it easy on the first day as the thin air made us walk slower than normal but it just encouraged  us to sit and relax. We loved the food and the delightful welcome tea made with peaches and apricots - rather addictive.  Our valet Krishna was amazing and very helpful . He brought tea to our tent and made sure we were up.in time for our excursions, always with a beaming smile. Tashi, our guide, was amazing at describing life in the villages and also the historic and religious aspects of the culture. It added so much depth to our holiday. Thank you to everyone at the camp for an unforgettable trip.  ",Happyface11111,/Profile/Happyface11111,,50
ladakh,Can't imagine there is a better way to experience Ladakh if you're going to do go high end. Luxurious tents (though really suites) with great service and a good restaurant. Location in grounds of the picturesque Thiksey monastery is wonderful - you feel miles away from the C21. Our guide Tom was particularly good - an unassuming font of knowledge and went out of his way to help us with onward travels (as did his friends in Leh - thank you to them if you read this!). Expensive but worth it.,HoraceQF,/Profile/HoraceQF,"London, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"We stayed at Chamba Camp, Thiksey for the first three days of our week long trip to Ladakh. The property is awesome !. The tents are luxurious, the food is sumptuous, location is unmatched with 360 degree view of the arid mountains of Ladakh. The library is well stock with coffee table books about Ladakh, Nubra and Zanskar. They have a personal valet service. Our valet was Krishna was efficient and always smiling. In house naturalist Akanksha knows her job and plans very well. She has very good knowledge about flora and fauna.  Jigmey at the reception tent was very courteous.We were in tents 1 and 2 which are best located with a view of Thiksey Monastery right in front. Highly recommended for acclimitisation after reaching Leh.",Amardeep S,/Profile/Amardeep_Samra,"Jalandhar, India",50
ladakh,"Great location - the camera cannot capture enough, exceptional service, super appetising food (we chose veg) ... packed with well-tailored excursions ; We had an awesome time at Ladakh thanks to TUTC and our guide Namgyal, who made our journey very comfortable and gave us the truly local experience. Highly recommend both Thiksey and Diskit camps!",GarfieldMumbai,/Profile/GarfieldMumbai,Mumbai,50
ladakh,"We stayed in Chamba Camp Thiskey for 5 nights and could have stayed for a lot longer. Our entire visit including the accommodation, our guide and driver, the fantastic food and the very friendly and welcoming staff (the setting was pretty awesome too) made it something we want to experience again. Words do not adequately portray the beauty of the area or its culture and heritage, we strongly recommend you to experience this for yourself - you will not be disappointed.",Viv259,/Profile/Viv259,Qatar,50
ladakh,"Disclosure: I only toured the place and ate in the restaurant, but the facilities, gardens, etc. are VERY luxurious and very high-end in all respects.  Picture British colonial styles for everything.  It isn't cheap.  The southside location was pretty good, given the usual mix of things one does in Leh (Thiksey, Sheh Palace, etc.)  You'll be impressed with the look of it.",HouTexTravel,/Profile/HouTexTravel,"Houston, Texas",50
ladakh,"We came across the camp quite by accident, finding it on the Internet while trawling for somewhere to stay in Ladakh. Booking was very easy, the reservations team attentive, responsive and informative. The whole experience from booking, paying, through meet, greet, stay and depart was seamlessly and painlessly executed by the team. And when you first see the area, it is breathtaking - and not just because it is 11,500 feet up - but because the camp sits in a valley between glorious, forbidding, imposing mountains which change colour with the sun. Chamba Camp proved to be a first class experience. We unhesitatingly recommend both Ladakh and Chamba.  The camp lies on land owned - and overlooked - by the stunning Thiksey Monastery. In the barren land, the generously spaced camp",D j R,/Profile/DjR867,United Kingdom,50
ladakh,"We had an outstanding time at the Chamba Camp Thicksey.  From the moment we arrived we were taken care of in every way. The service here is beyond amazing.  Our Luxury tent was perfect for our stay.  This isn't a classic tent- it was beautiful inside!  We had our own driver and guide throughout the time we stayed with them.  We visited several monasteries, went to the city, visited Khardung-la pass and even spent one night at their camp in Nubra.  I can't tell you how wonderful the entire experience was, you just have to go and see it for yourself!!  (We were there last year- I didn't see the profile for the camp when I was doing reviews last year but saw it today and wanted to share my positive experiences.)  They even took us on a special hike for our anniversary, we got to",Travcarib,/Profile/Travcarib,Washington DC,50
ladakh,"Just one of the best places on earth to relax and enjoy the magnificant monestry and mountains. Lots of privacy, good meals with a lot of choice also in western cuisine. Service is kind and accurate. The only thing is to take care of altitude sickness esp. when you fly in. It took us 2 days to acclimatise and still stayed a little bit shaky. Nevertheless had the time of our life here. Do visit the monks in the early morning!  Oscar&Angeline",oscar a,/Profile/oscara113,"Hilvarenbeek, The Netherlands",50

They have a few indoor activities - basketball, archery, cycling, a small collection of books and board games too. The food is great too.Highly recommended if you are looking for a 7 star camping experience.",Roopshree K,/Profile/roopshreek,"Singapore, Singapore",50

ladakh,"We were at the Cloud Cafe and happened to get a small tour of this property. (Note: we did not stay here just had a tour). The property was just amazing, the rooms are very well furnished and air-conditioned; very few properties in Leh have a fan forget an AC. The view from the porch of every single room is just magnificent, when you're here you can either choose to get the view of the wonderful snow caped mountains or you can choose to get the view of the good old Thiksey Monastery. If we hadn't already booked what we had booked we would probably have chosen to stay at this place!",Travel_amazingly_007,/Profile/Travel_amazingly_007,Indiana,50
ladakh,"This is camping in 7-star luxury! From the moment we stepped into the camp, we knew we were in good hands. We were handed cold towels & a sweet herbal tea as a welcome gesture.  Then we were led to our spacious camp with a stunning chandelier, antique furniture, a four-poster bed & a beautiful deck with spectacular views! Is this heaven or what?  And all the meals were awesome....had the tastiest mango pana cotta, caramel pudding, a three-chocolate cake & yet more desserts. The savouries were no less either. Loved the thin pizzas, the grilled shrimps, thupka soup & the milky bottle gourd curry! And 1 day we were even served icecream cones.  Sublime experience!",Nomita Khanna,/Profile/Nomita-Khanna,"Ludhiana, India",50
ladakh,"Our welcome at TUTC was very nice and warm, the location of the camp was scenic and was in the midst of nature, away from all the noise of the town. The tent was luxurious in itself, the bathroom was big and spacious and was not short of any amenity. Furthermore, the service was very good, the staff was always there to help. Even though the menu of all the 3 courses was small yet surprisingly sufficient at the same time and varied everyday. However, I was a bit shocked when they said that they could provide us with soft drinks in the minibar but not juice. If we wanted juice we would've been charged extra. Also, in the dining area, soft drinks were again free, but, mocktails were charged. Even though we got the things served as per to our expectation yet we were shocked by this.",Manbab94,/Profile/Manbab94,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,This camp is styled along the lines of the  high end African Safari camps and it matches up. There is a dedicated guide and a driver who take you on all your excursions. Our guide Tom was a native of Thiksey and really brought the surrounding area alive for us.  The food was excellent with a good choice of Indian and International cuisine. The staff is attentive without being obtrusive. The tents are are furnished to extremely high specifications.  All in all .. Worth a visit .. It's a pretty unique experience in India. ,doitwhileyoucan71,/Profile/doitwhileyoucan71,"Mumbai, India",50
