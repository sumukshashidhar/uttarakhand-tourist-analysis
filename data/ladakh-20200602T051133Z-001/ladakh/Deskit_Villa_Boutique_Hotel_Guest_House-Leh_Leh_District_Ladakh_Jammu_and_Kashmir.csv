ladakh,"Being a traveler, Deskit villa is the most beautiful property I have ever been. My finance and I went to ladakh on mid April as one of our flagship tours. The villa is surrounded by panoramic sceneries.. The hosts were amazing in terms of hospitality. The amenities were extremely appreciative.. The food was homemade and typical hot cooked meal, we were needing most at 8 degree temperature.. I highly recommend deskit villa to travellers while their stay in ladakh..

ladakh,"Booked two rooms for two nights This place is only for non indians as they did there best to make us feel neglected.  - No one asked for welcome drink (tea/coffee) upon arrival. -while having breakfast, as soon as the other group (foreigners) came, the instantly said that breakfast is finished only bread is available now. Rude. -i was making payment at the reception but she (lady in charge) ignored us and left the conversation abruptly and went on asking other new occupants if they need anything. - rooms in villa are ill constructed. In one room, the exhaust window of toilet opens in room itself. In our two rooms, the exhaust window of toilet opens in other room's toilet and other room's conversation is loud and clear. -no electricity in evening and no Power backup.  - faulty",vipul s,/Profile/vipuls959,,20
ladakh,"Deskit Villa is a beautiful place. Away from the maddening crowd, tucked away, easily accessible via road and a beautiful shortcut through the back lanes of the town.. Just a bit above Sankar Gompa.  Nice apple trees in the garden, a swing to bask in the sunshine on, a little library and sit out area with beautiful pictures and most importantly very warm hosts with a efficient team.  We were there for the Marathon and had booked the guest house. We also ended up staying at the Boutique hotel for a day when the guest house was full.   The Boutique Hotel is comfortable, romantic, with big spacious room and big well done washroom. The mattress was nice and hard.. just whats good for your back. You have a nice private balcony overlooking the mountains and the fields.. where you can",Pulkita,/Profile/pulkitaparsai,"Noida, India",50
ladakh,"We spent a total of 1 week at Deskit Villa and loved it!  We stayed in rooms in both the guest house and hotel sections and were very pleased with both.  Deskit Villa is a short walk out of the main market area and has great views of the garden and mountains beyond. The location was great and the staff incredibly sweet, friendly and helpful.",Gary B,/Profile/garyb622,"Sag Harbor, New York",50
ladakh,"In the villa (not the hotel) of this guesthouse we stayed three times during our roundtrip in Ladakh. You walk down to the city centre along little paths between the houses. It is a nice downhill walk. Returning is then a long uphill and the path might be difficult to follow.  However, even though a bit away from the city centre on an uitside ring road, the place is well-known to taxi drivers who will bring you back up for Rs 150. So, the distance is no issue really. The rooms are specious (# 105 and 102 18m2 and room 101 20m2) with bathrooms of 4-5 m2). Warm water through an electric boiler, but difficult to regulate. The distance to the town centre almost eliminates the daily noises from the mosques and there are nice views. In this guesthouse, the matresses were the very best",huys25,/Profile/huys25,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",40
ladakh,"My wife, adult daughter and I stayed at Deskit Villa during July 2016.  We read about Deskit Villa on Lonely Planet.  The accommodations, the owners, and the staff were great during our on and off two week stay.  We did a trek and road trip and looked forward to coming back to this lovely oasis after each journey.   The food was good and very vegetarian (I survived by eating momos in town occasionally).  We stayed in the guest house and it was clean throughout.   The bed was comfortable and the bathroom modern to western standards.    They have a garden and grow their own vegis or buy them from the neighbors garden.  The staff were unbelievably gracious and in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition humble and happy.  The owners worked with us on getting our payments made via credit card",Miguel E,/Profile/miguele22,,50
ladakh,"The reception is very nice The rooms are spacious and the beds comfortable. The food is good and varied. The garden and terrace are beautiful, shaded, quiet.

ladakh,They have two properties. The guest house and the hotel. The guest house is for a budget traveller. Both the properties are excellent and offer a boutique experience. The staff is hospitable and extremely sweet. The owners Mrs. Thinles and Mr. Lobzang are very helpful. The food is homely yet the spread is exquisite. Had a great time. It's located 15-20 mins away from the Changspa and main market. If you're keen to walk then this is worth an experienced nestled away from the bustle of the town.,GauravChandiwala,/Profile/GauravChandiwala,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"The location and setting are perfect, the owners are always present and helpful, the staff is excellent and friendly, the food is solid, and the mattresses are phenomenal. I would definitely stay at Deskit Villa again, without hesitation. JULLAY for everything! ",adamsoliman,/Profile/adamsoliman,Dubai,50
ladakh,"We stayed at Deskit Villa for three nights. The owner Lobsang, his wife ( a lawyer and who supervises the kitchen and service for breakfast and dinner) and especially the lady Friday Ms. Tsomo ( from a village in Zanskar valley) were nice, helpful and wonderful respectively.  The breakfast (with eggs) and pure vegetarian dinners were simple and nice!  Two more offerings that would make this place worthy of Five stars:  a. Do something about the Internet being distributed per floor rather than a point between the two buildings that makes the wifi signal weak and the net even slower, when available.  b. Offer non vegetarian food for dinners also.  Go for room in the front in the new building. And beware that there are no lifts. So climbing to the second floor can be a bit of a",chandanc22,/Profile/chandanc22,"Pune, India",40
ladakh,"We used this place as base for our trip, 3 of us . We stayed in both new wing and guesthouse. Both have beautiful common areas and have an airy feel .The rooms are big ,comfortable, clean, older in guesthouse but still very comfortable , all with beautiful views of stupa, leh palace or surrounding fields /Himalayas from balconies. Nice hot showers. Grounds are lovely, well kept and welcoming. Staff very nice and reactive, will try their best to accommodate you. It takes about 15-20mn to walk to leh, nice walking path that the staff showed us , a cab will cost you 2$ to come back. We had very good breakfast everyday.  No problems with english, hosts frendly , very knowledgeable and could probably organize a lot for you.  Beware Internet not always working but that's Ladakh.

ladakh,"Very cosy, confortable, authentic place to stay in . We (2 parents+ 3 Young adults+ 3 teens) spent Ã  terrific vacation in Ladakh. First time there, although already having traveled in France, Marocco and Namibia to discover the people/cultures/landscapes/history and do some sports. Ladakh is a great country where people are so kind and true. The Diskit Villa is a very nice place To stay when coming back from a trek or a bycicle ride. The rooms are big, the beds confortable, the electricity is working and you can take a hot shower at any time. The crew is very helpful although not keen to take initiatives without the approval from the owner/manager (a very kind woman, dedicated To the satisfaction of her guests). Very good cook. Ask for upper rooms for a better view.",Michel M,/Profile/237michelm,"Uccle, Belgium",40
ladakh,"Deskit Villa is conveniently located on the outskirts of Leh (a good thing, i.e. far from the noise and the dust). Rooms are clean, spacious, and included a nice bathroom with hot water. My room also had a nice terrace overlooking Leh, Shanti Stupa, and Leh Palace. The scenery is really fantastic! The hosts are extremely friendly and helpful. They helped me organize my whole tour of Ladakh, including a trek, car rides, and a motorbike ride. I highly recommend Deskit Villa as your base camp for touring around the wonderful Ladakh region. I'll definitely go back there soon!",BenFor,/Profile/BenFor,"Paris, France",50
ladakh,"When you are looking for a wind down after a tough bike ride this is the place to be. Great hospitality, good rooms, green surroundings, good food and lovely people. There is no much parking space, however that gets managed. Close to the market area yet away from the crowd! Great place to be!",NandalalP,/Profile/NandalalP,"Jodhpur, India",50
ladakh,"Enjoyed our stay here immensely.  Stayed a week in the hotel with stunning uninterupted views over farmland to the mountains. Most comfortable beds you'll find.  Clean and modern bathroom with very friendly and helpful staff.  There is a lovely garden and sheltered reading area for some peaceful relaxing far from the bustle of town, though only a pleasant 15  minute stroll downhill (you may want to catch a cab home though as it's quite a steep climb if you're not acclimatized to the altitude).

ladakh,"The Deskit Villa guest house in Leh consists of two Buildings. One, the smaller one, is built in a typically Ladakhian way. The rooms there are big, with wooden floors, nice wooden ceilings, toilet inside the rooms with hot shower. Things are simple, but charming. My wive and I spent two nights, from Sept. 2. 2013 to Sept. 4. 2013 in the cheaper house and and found it a good deal. After a trecking we spent two more nights, from Sept. 18.  2013 to Sept. 20. 2013 in the expensive (main) house of Deskit Villa. In contrast to the cheaper one, the room was smaller, with scummy carpet on the floor and very tastless modern furniture, that was already heavily worn down. The cleaning of the room was badly done. We wanted to change the room to the first one, even for the price of the",Robert E,/Profile/roberte706,Schaffhausen,30
ladakh,"I stayed here several times, and I'm reluctant to promote this place too much, as I like to be able to get one of the rooms when I next visit Leh... but to be fair, I must give this place its due. It is a genuinely sweet and comfortable guesthouse with 3 forward facing rooms and 2 side facing. Recently, the attention to detail has relaxed as the owners have opened up a larger hotel on the same property and seem to be having some staffing issues, but these are minor niggles. Overall, one of my favourite locations to spend a few days in Leh. It is a bit of a way out of the main market, so if you are on foot and want to be close to the town, find something else. If you are prepared to enjoy the 10-15 minute walk through the back lanes to get to Changspa, then give it a look.",Russell_Yak_Trak_201,/Profile/Russell_Yak_Trak_201,Byron Bay,50
ladakh,"A second stay at the immaculate and friendly Deskit Villa with hot water and electricity 24 hours a day (when the Leh electricity works).  Plenty of warm blankets in case you need them. Tasty, vegetarian food only. Owned and run by Skywalkertravel.com, the affable Lobsang will arrange, modify and create whatever you'd like to see anywhere in Ladakh and India. Use the Deskit Villa to come and go, leave some bags behind. Prepare to meet and share experiences with French, German, Belgium and other European tourists.
