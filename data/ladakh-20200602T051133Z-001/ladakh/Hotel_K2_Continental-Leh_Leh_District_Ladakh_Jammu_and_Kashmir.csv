ladakh,Its mid size hotel (approx 20 rooms) with a restaurant. Its little far (approx 5-6 km) from market so a cab takes approx 200 inr one side.  - Location was a little far from the market. - Price was economical (approx 2k per night with breakfast and dinner) - Rooms are average - Washroom is good  - Food is below average - Service is good - Wifi range was not very good,Kshitijgoel10,/Profile/Kshitijgoel10,"Noida, India",30

Rooms are big having all amenities except the hot water which was available from morning 7am to 11am.This hotel is located in the calm greenfield area with splendid view of Himalayan Mountains. The hotel embodies best of local traditions in its decor and architecture. The food taste is also good and the staff is friendly. Only demerit is that it is far from Leh Market, and very close to the airport.

The hotel is little far from main market so if you don't have your own vehicle, each time you have to shell out Rs.200 for going to market and Rs.200 for coming back.      The room in new renovated building was of decent size with a panoramic unobstructed view. The bathroom too was furnished but each time you need hot water in morn., you have to ask at the reception for switching on boiler which took approximately 30 mins.      The breakfast served at the hotel (we had taken it as part of package) is very minimalistic. Since Leh is pretty developed, we expected a better spread.

ladakh,"That was the hopeless hotel I have ever experienced in my life. The receptionist was very rude and didn’t accommodate any of the request. For ex. we were told the hot water will only be provided in the mornings from 6-8 am. There were no geysers in the individual rooms and having come to a place like Leh, I would expect provision of 24 hrs hot water as a basic requirement in the hotel. Further we have come on a leisure trip and will take our own time to wake-up and have bath. To ensure we get hot water for bathing we had to get-up early every day and it was very difficult with the children. Even for drinking, though we requested them to provide hot water, it wasn’t provided. The room service is another bad experience. Any food ordered on phone will come only after about 2 hours",Munawar B,/Profile/MunawarB7,,30

Most of the staff had gone on leave since it was the beginning of off season and hotel was due to close for winter from 15th October to end of March. The location of hotel is not so good as it is close to the airport but far from the city centre and market area.

The rooms are clean and spacious and most offer a scenic view of the surrounding mountains. Toiletries provided are minimal with just a small bar of soap.

The room aesthetics are seriously disfigured which cause suffocation and there is no ventilation in the room. The hotel staff is supportive but the food served in the MAP plan is totally not worth it. They prepare the food in preference of the North Indians and thus do not expect any Ladakhi or Kashmiri food servings. The ala carte menu is too costly.
