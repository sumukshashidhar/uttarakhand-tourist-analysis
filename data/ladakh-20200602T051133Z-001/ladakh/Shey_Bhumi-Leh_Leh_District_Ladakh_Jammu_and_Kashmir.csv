ladakh,Shey Bhumi is sitiuated in one of the most picturesque settings.The ever changing sight of the mountains is a sight for someone from the city.Added to this the superb care that Rupesh and his team of boys take makes the stay really memorable. A few suggestions since the days were very warm a table fan in room will certainly help .Also while the wild grass adds its own charm they have to be completely trimmed from the  pathways leading up to the rooms .,Archana61,/Profile/Archana61,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Small property in a quiet location,  only 20min away of the crazy central leh market.  Near the Indus river with awesome views of the nearby monasteries and the beauty of an old ladhakhi house as main building and dining room.  Rooms are big and comfortable with lots of small charming details.  Food is wonderful and you can choose between continental,  Indian or local specialities.  Definitely a great place to be near leh.

ladakh,We a couple with children of ages 14 and 7 along with another couple stayed at shey bhumi on 22nd and 23rd of June 2017. ..we landed in Leh by air n straightforwardly taken to this paradise by our taxi driver...it is amidst greenery whch seems to be a forest as it is far away from main city. The place is so beautiful that it captured every eye....the scenic beauty is mesmerizing there. Rooms are not upto high standards as they have tried to keep them close to nature but were well equipped with whatever we wanted...we felt the need of an exhaust fan in the bathroom...rooms very pretty n ethnic though.....we jus loved them...their manager Mr Rupesh Sawant was extraordinarily hospitable..he was full of knowledge about the place and the flaura n fauna and was keen to share that wt,Raushni J,/Profile/raushnij2015,"Ludhiana, India",50
ladakh,"We were a large group and stayed here for one night. The property or rather the cottages that house guests are newly built in typical Ladakh style.  The common area or the dining space is an old house and the owner Mr. Arif shows you the place with a lot of pride.  The cottages are nice , spacious and clean. Overall the concept is very interesting. They take care of individual needs and are very warm.  Being away from the hustle bustle of the town you even see birds and can enjoy beautiful view of the distant hills covered with snow.  A nice stay. Good luck to you... may you do very well.

ladakh,"All aspects of our stay with Shey Bhumi were awesome !! The management and staff there took great care in organizing a perfect trip for us. The location of this property is outstanding - just outside Leh in a amazingly picturesque location and about 200 feet walk from the Indus river, Shey Bhumi has everything you can ask for your trip to Leh. The Leh village style architecture of the resort is impressive and the restaurant is actually a 300 year old Ladakhi style house. The resort manager Rupesh took great care in planning every detail of our trip. The staff is friendly, food is great and most importantly, most of it is grown fresh in the resort's garden. We (family of 4) were fully pampered from the time we landed in Leh till we departed.  Highly recommended !!!",ashishsaraf1,/Profile/ashishsaraf1,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"Breathtaking view, excellent resort, sweet and kind staff, very helpful. Room was very comfortable, we enjoyed every second of our 5 day stay. Food was also very good and all our dietary requirements were taken care of.",Udit B,/Profile/229uditb,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
ladakh,"Everything about this place was wonderful; the location, the service, the food, the accommodation and the tour itinerary.  The property consists of 10 individual cottages and a restored Ladakhi house which serves as the communal area and dining room . It is set in a fantastic location with 360° views of the mountains.  It's close enough to Leh town so that you can easily visit the market and experience the hustle and bustle, but far enough away to offer a peaceful environment.   Prior to our arrival, the resort manager communicated regularly with us over weather conditions, food preferences etc.. Throughout our stay, he was on hand to chat and check how things were going. All the staff are friendly and helpful; we were really well looked after . There are some lovely touches",Sue P,/Profile/319sued,"Sandbach, United Kingdom",50
