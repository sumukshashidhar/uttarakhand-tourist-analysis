ladakh,It has been an amazing work of passion and dedication to renovate this 200 years old palace and adapt it to modern comfort while keeping the original soul of the place. The owner and his family live on the palace and have also created a very interesting museum retracing the history of the Royal Family and traditions of Ladakh. Not to be missed!. Conveniently located near Leh and Thiksey Monastry,Asiadvisor001,,"Bangkok, Thailand",50
ladakh,A small property with beautiful rooms and with great amenities. A little away from the chaos of the city and reaching there was a little challenge but hope in near future the bridge that was under repair will be fixed.  Food is freshly made and have different cuisine each time. the staff is very helpful and friendly.,tusharrcmn,,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
ladakh,"A delightful little property just outside Leh. Right now a challenge due to construction but once you reach you forget the chaos of the city and travel. Three suites with two bedroom each, delightful menu and food, a helping staff and you have a ball of a stay! Chill with beer and a book and skip all tours around!",Sujit B,,"New Delhi, India",40
