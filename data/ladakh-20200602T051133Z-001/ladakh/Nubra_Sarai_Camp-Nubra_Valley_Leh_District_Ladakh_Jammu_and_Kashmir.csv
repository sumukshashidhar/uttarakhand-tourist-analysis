ladakh,The tents are furnished with all amenities and bathroom attached with running hot water. The food was excellent. Its quite good to have a walk around the surroundings of the camp and its an excellent spot for bird watching,jkkartha,/Profile/jkkartha,"Kochi (Cochin), India",50
ladakh,We stayed at Nubra Sarai for Night as part of Khardung La-Hundar-Pangong route. We got probably the best food in our entire stay in Ladakh. Thanks to the folks in restaurant to satisfy our taste buds in the barren and intimidating Nubra Valley. Tents are good enough with clean toilets. Areas to improve upon is hot water connection in toilets (instead of providing bucketful of warm water) and tackling the stay dogs roaming around.,PradeepPaliwal,/Profile/PradeepPaliwal,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
ladakh,"- Located in the midst of sand dunes of Nubra valley 10,000 feet above sea level - Different experience specially chilly nights - Could have been more cosy and better amenities but due to extremely difficult terrain nothing more than basic amenities. - In house restaurant as well as in house dining - You can enjoy a cup of tea and pakodas sitting outside your tent looking at Karakoram range (Himalayas) - Daunting experience if you look out at mountains at night. - Sand dunes nearby, private vehicle is a must",Vaibhav B,/Profile/686vaibhavb,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"We booked a package tour via Yatra and we were just disappointed with the stay here. The attached bathroom had a stinking smell, basin water flowed inside the bathroom, the lawn was not mowed, the tent material was not clean and so filmsy that we could hear people in the next tent talking. It is also far from the other tents (this can be a good thing for some). I find two pros -   a) the stuff was very well behaved and helpful b) the view was good (when I say good it means you can get a couple of good shots if you walk out of the tent area - nothing more)",saurav_chat,/Profile/saurav_chat,Kolkata,20
ladakh,"The place is scenic beauty. Camps were well managed, clean and maintained. The food and services were good too. But the staff was very disciplined and they were following army rules in terms of providing services and were not ready to deviate themselves for any comfort to visitors.",rishikawatra2001,/Profile/rishikawatra2001,"Jodhpur, India",30
ladakh,Let's talk about bad things first as there aren't many except that they need to work on developing their garden which is almost barren currently. Now the good things- 1. Excellent food - can you imagine eating all sorts of cuisines in the middle of nowhere. Yes. And that to well prepared and staff serving was so courteous. 2. Water stream flowing through the property gives it an edge. 3. Service really good 4. Attached washrooms are not temporary. They are proper concrete structures which is very smart and hygenic. 5. The circular way in which tents are put up gives it a good look with no 1 tent better than other. All are equal and good.,vagrant_wanderer,/Profile/vagrant_wanderer,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"This tents are average one. Yes its neat and clean. There is a good view of the mountains around. but since its hosted at the place where there are trees and bushes you can expect some unwanted insects roaming in your tents :P . They do not have any insect replants.  One plus point is they have a table fan which most of the others do not have. It makes your sleep comfortable when u need it. The bathrooms are clean and dry. Yes the service is excellent. U can for Tea, you call for hot water or anything and they will be their immediately. All the staffs are nice and helpful.  Food- I didnt liked. Menu was ok but taste was totally missing :(. Most of the food i didnt felt like repeating again after we took the initial plate.  Its just 10 min from the Sand Dunes.  Its a budget stay",debarghyadatta,/Profile/debarghyadatta,"Bengaluru, India",30
ladakh,"Stayed here for a night but property was not in good condition n even location is nothing much to describe. There was not much hygiene around, tents were shabby. Stay was very courteous n helpful all d time. Food was average. ",Satyajit D,/Profile/SatyajitD64,,30
ladakh,This camp in Nubra valley is beautifully located amidst the mountains.. I stayed here for a day along with 2 of my friends.. The staff was very cooperative and warm.. Food was way better than what we had expected.. Running Hot water is not available but is provided in buckets by the staff!!  Weather is hot during the day and cold at nights (in June) .. Overall a great experience of staying in tents in the lap of nature !!  PS: Do watch the traditional dances and go for a camel ride in the desert which is quite close by to this place!!,Prachi1991,/Profile/Prachi1991,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,Reached Nubra sarai after travelling 5hrs from Leh thru very bad roads.....tents were ok....electricity was off most of time....even we hav to eat dinner before 9.30pm as electricity goes after that....a small handy emergency light is provided in rooms...food was good & with varieties.... ...but overall didn't njoyed as there  is nothing to do much....simply lie in ur tent....so not worth going there thru very bad roads.....bad roads means really bad.... ,ravirohra,/Profile/ravirohra,,10
ladakh,"I visited in the month on may 2016. Very nice place. the camp is situated near the sand dunes approx 500 mtr walking distance. Food is good. Service is awesome. Tent has nice cozy beds  attach toilets with hot water, wash basin etc. They can arrange you evening snacks tea coffee at yuour ease at different timings. Food is buffet ( good quality ).Must visit this camp",yash c,,"Hyderabad, India",50
ladakh,"The tents were basic but very spacious. Clean and well maintained. We stayed for one night and the experience was good. There is a deser safari and camel ride near by, other than than there is nothing much to do in the tents. Food was ok. Staff were very kind and accomodative.",sandhya k,,,30
ladakh,"Basic camps with normal amenities, there is nothing much to do, no activities. You will find many similar camp resorts in the area and nothing more than that, we arrived late afternoon and they had no food to offer, not even Maggi or anything. All they could offer was tea, as we were very hungry we had to go back to town to find food for ourselves. Thereafter visited sand dunes and came back to our tents. Dinner was below average and so was breakfast. They do not have running hot water and you need to ask for drinking water as well. In nut shell, do not expect much. Just ok!!",Abhishek,,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
ladakh,"The nubra sarai camp is a great place to stay. In fact the boys were too friendly and served us tea and provided hot buckets of water in scheduled time we asked for! They serve ONLY vegetarian! And the food was also good. The overall service is excellent. The camel ride is just 5min from the camp. Also mind that even if u speak softly inside the tent, it can be heard outside almost clearly. ",Vaibhav S,,,50

ladakh,"Nubra Sarai is very basic camping site, there's nothing there to see in there and it's just the camp. The staff I must say were helpful and the food offered was good. I would recommend an early morning view of the Nubra valley sit by the side of the stream and enjoy the picturesque sunrise from the middle of snow clad mountains.",Abhi5684,/Profile/Abhi5684,"Jaipur, India",30
ladakh,The tents are very basic. No luxury and dnt ask for it. Give you the real experience to spend a night in valley. The Hospitality of the staff is very good. Tea is always available with them. The morning weather as great in Aug month. The desert evening time is unforgettable. Like to visit this kind of place again.,Nisha717,/Profile/Nisha717,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"Bundled in with my tour package, the Nubra Sarai was my pit-stop in Nubra. An over-night stay was the deal, got extended by a night due to blocked roads.  The location is the killer. You are in the lap of nature with this one. The whole drive from Leh to Nubra is a treat to the eyes, and this place is no less. Clean skies, birds chirping all around, nestled between the mountains , absolutely amazing! The night sky just lit up like a chandelier. A treat for all city people who seldom get to see such a sight. The staff lit a bonfire to further enhance the experience.  The tents are quite basic. A double bed, clean and comfortable, a table and a fan. The loo is attached to the tent, just about gets the work done. Hot water via solar heaters(thumbs up!), but not directly connected",NeelIndap,/Profile/NeelIndap,"Boston, Massachusetts",40
ladakh,"This is a tented accommodation near Hunder sand dunes. The tents are very basic with attached toilet. When we stayed there, strong winds were blowing and the tent was shaking a lot. The wind constantly blows under the zipper door of the tent as it is not fully packed, so you won't get a quality sleep.  Food was good. Staff is friendly. Overall decent experience.",Rahul6587,/Profile/Rahul6587,"Bengaluru, India",30
ladakh,"We arrived at the campsite late in the afternoon but the people there were very friendly and helped us unpack the luggage on the top of our SUV. The food, both dinner and breakfast, were very good and each of the staff were personally taking care of the guests needs on the tables. The tents were also of good quality and warm. They staff provided us with the hot water bottles. They also had campfire at night, we only went to bed at 2 in the morning!! The camp is also near to the sand dunes where you have all the activities. You can ride double-hump camels. Overall a very pleasant stay.",nits0505,/Profile/nits0505,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"The location of the place is very good as it is closest to the Sand Dunes, the only amusement at Nubra Valley. The Sleep and Food Quality at this accommodation was very nice. However, the bathroom requires lot of improvement. The camps are not of the expected quality however, manageable for one night only. Hospitality and service of the staff is marvellous.",Ashish Singla,/Profile/ashishsinglaadvocate,"Sirsa, India",30
ladakh,"I was just taken away by the location of the camp as there i could see the birds which i couldn't either on my way to nubra valley neither anywhere else. Apart from that the manager Mr. Stanzin, he was the politest person i have met. He really takes good care of the guests, and the other chaps lovely, lucky and mayank.

ladakh,"Nubra Valley is a must visit place if you visit Leh. Apx it is 130 kms from Leh after crossing KHARDUNGLA PASS ( Highest motorable road in the world) which is quite time taking due to heavy snow fall and snow on the way, thats why you should take a one night stay in nubra.  When I say blessing in disguise that means you will mostly find tent accommodations in Nubra and that also not too luxurious. Nubra sarai also falls in that category but when you taste their main course or snacks you feel like home its just DELICIOUS.  Manager and satff is hostile enough to take care of you.",Amit S,/Profile/SahniAmit,"New Delhi, India",40

ladakh,"We stayed in this tent for just one night. It is very close to the dunes. Food was good. We got the tea served in the tents.  The tents were good, warn and comfortable. But something can be done about the interiors to make it aesthetically better looking is what I felt. Mornings were beautiful sitting by their garden and the mountain view.

ladakh,The camps in which we stayed were too tiny and didn't even have basic amenities like a table fan. We had to request for one and we finally got it after waiting for a while. The toilets though attached with the rooms did not please us as all the fittings were rickety and makeshift. This place is merely a shadow of its parent- Ladakh Sarai and would disappoint any traveler who has great expectations. ,anshumaang,/Profile/anshumaang,"New Delhi, India",30
ladakh,"While visiting a place like Ladakh, the inclination towards tent stays are natural. What better place to enjoy one of the most beautiful place in the entire journey of Ladakh travel than this camp.  The food is amazing and the tents are spacious with in built bathrooms and toilets. There is seating outside the tents for chatting and the surrounding is peaceful.  Only 1 bucket of hot water is provided per person so people who need more water in the cold season beware...  Highly recomended place for everyone who goes to Nubra valley...",DPratham,/Profile/DPratham,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",40
ladakh,"I took up a package and spent total of 7 nights in Ladakh (5 nights in Ladakh Sarai, 1 night in Nubra Sarai & 1 night in Pangong Sarai).  In Nubra Sarai, the tents are simpler but still nice, peaceful location with pretty sunflowers and set among the mountains. I am pleasantly surprised that the tents comes with private attached western-style toilet. The staff is very attentive and polite as well.  The tent next door had a couple who was in the midst of a quarrel and they were yelling & shouting at each other throughout the evening.  That was a real spoiler for me but its not the property's fault. The staff did ask if I wanted to change to another tent but I declined since it was only for 1 night and I brought earplugs along anyway.  Overall this is my least favourite site among",Travel Chronicles of Ping,/Profile/TravelChroniclesPing,"Singapore, Singapore",30
ladakh,We stayed at the nubra serai in nubra valley during our recent trip to ladakh in august..and must say though they were tents they were well equipped with necessary requirements...it had an attached bathroom...though hot water was not provided directly we could always request the hotel guys and they would promptly provide a bucketfull of hot water rit till ur tent..the bed was quite cosy with enough blankets to keep you warm in the night as temperatures dropped drastically...there was electricity till 11 pm in the night after which there was total darkness except for the torch lights provided by them..the food was again good and they were kind enough to make the kind of food that we requested for..the nubra serai is a little in the bushes so it might be difficult to find it but,jugal2512,/Profile/jugal2512,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"While the access road into all the Hunder accommodation is not at all salubrious - past army camps - Nubra Sarai is a tranquil setting of tented accommodation in Hunder, with a backdrop of soaring Ladakhi cliffs. The tents are basic but the beds are comfy. The dinner and breakfast served at Nubra Sarai was some of the best food of our trip - congratulations to the chef in such an isolated location. Service was impeccable - wonderful thanks Tenzay and his team. There are no power points in the rooms but there is a charging station in the dinner/common area which suffices. The only challenge was the barking dogs - all night long - which we were told are a real problem in all parts of Hunder.",Suebru_12,/Profile/Suebru_12,"Cairns, Australia",40
