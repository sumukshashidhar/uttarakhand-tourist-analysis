ladakh,"Stayed overnight in a Tent at this camp. Camp site is full of greeneries, vegetable plants and fruit bearing trees which provide nice relief to mind after seeing only dry mountains. This camp has a kitchen which offers buffet breakfast also dinner included in the room tariff. Tent is provided with double cot & Matress with blankets, quilt to cope with the cold weather. Tent has attached toilet and bath facility with a wash basin, hot water is supplied in taps in the morning. Approach road is very narrow and bad but motorable. Inside camp there is enough space available for parking cars. Bonfire is arranged by the camp on request on chargeable basis. Every Tent is provided with two easy chairs for guest to relax viewing the mountainous sceneries around.",BALASHOTELREVIEW,,CHENNAI,40
