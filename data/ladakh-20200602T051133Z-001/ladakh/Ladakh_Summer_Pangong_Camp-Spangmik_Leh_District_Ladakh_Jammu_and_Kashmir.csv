ladakh,"To stay in a camp with a view of the Pangong lake turned out to be an unbelievable experience for us. The lake in itself is majestic and staying in a camp made it a bigger adventure. The camps are nice and clean with all basic amenities. The staff is extremely helpful. It's amazing how they try to make your stay comfortable in every way. They provide hot water in the morning for an hour or so. Electricity is available in the evening for a couple of hours. However, all these things are secondary when you have better things to enjoy there. The food was great..served hot..it's commendable what they do for you even in such adverse conditions. It was extremely windy and cold when we stayed..the staff provided extra blankets and hot water bottles to keep us warm. Highly recommended!",Swati A,/Profile/SwatiA318,,50
ladakh,I visited during Race With Time In Icy Ladakh 2019. Good place to stay. Pangong view is always awesome during my all visits. As i am biker and i felt it should be more budget friendly... But still an ideal place to enjoy a good stay.,Pepper Salt,/Profile/Pepper_Salt_Biker,,40
ladakh,Do you have a talent for bargaining?if yes yatra.com is the place for you.they take pride in giving 5-10 thousand rupees difference for fellow group members in the same group.one who is the best negotiater gets lowest price for the same package.what more the later you book cheaper you get.the trick is to put the querry and show no interest and say a competitor is giving at lower price ... they lower down the price like anything.,docartig,/Profile/docartig,"Junagadh, India",30

ladakh,Decent tents with cleanliness. Helpful staff. Good food (Never expected Rajma Rice in dinner and Chole Puri in breakfast at Pangong). Electricity for only 4 hours (as expected).

ladakh,"Pangong itself is so beautiful that all other things doesn't really matter in front of it. I reached Pangong at around 4 in evening and has Ladakh summer camp booked for a night. As soon as Pangong area starts one can see a lot of tented accommodations, Ladakh summer camp is actually around 10 kms from the point of 1st view of Pangong, so one need to drive further to Spangmik to reach Ladakh summer camp, Spangmik looks like a tented colony with hundreds of tented accommodation. (if anyone has visited Kutch just remember Dhordo the tent village, same is for Spangmik)  The road till Spangmik is good with Pangong on one side & Himalayas on the other. Reaching Spangmik is easy but finding the tented accommodation is a bit time consuming as there are not much directions, we need to",nynikhil,/Profile/nynikhil,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30

ladakh,"Stayed here for one night as a part of a birding tour. I was staying in a single tent on the lower level of the property and found these tents to be clean and comfortable. The bath room is adequate and though there is no hot water in the taps, the friendly staff are eager to help you with a bucket of nice hot water for a bath / wash. There were no charging points in these tents - I guess one could use the common points in the dining room. And in any case, the only thing to be charged are the camera batteries. Power to the entire property is through a generator (which is located close to the lower level tents) and is switched on at sunset for a few hours (7pm to 10:30pm during my stay). It does get bright by about 5:30am, so one doesn't really feel the pinch of having no",SamSridharan,/Profile/SamSridharan,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
ladakh,The camp consists of spacious tents... clean adn hygienic. The food (jain food) was good compared to very limited services and stuff available there. The camp faces the lake.. pangong lake is just 2 to 3 mins walk away.. one can enjoy the sunrise n sunset even from this camp if its too chilly n windy to go up to the lake. The staff was friendly enough to give us precautionary tips to stay without health issues at pangong. Overall very good experience.,Avani S,/Profile/AvaniS92,,40
