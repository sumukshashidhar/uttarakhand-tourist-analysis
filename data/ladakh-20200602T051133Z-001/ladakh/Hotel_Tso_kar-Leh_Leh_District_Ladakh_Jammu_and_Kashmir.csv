ladakh,"When me and my sister first landed at leh.. our driver took us to hotel tsokar.. but it was full.. so we opted for a bnb next to hotel tsokar.. During our last two days we were fortunate to stay at hotel tsokar.. It is little costly compared to the other guest houses but i still found it reasonable.. It has a beautiful sit out ver u can interact with the other tourists.. The food and tea they served was just lip smacking and delicious.. The rooms are big ,spacious and very clean..The bathrooms are clean with running hot water...It is very near to the market and u have many restaurants like gesmo and lamayuru just on the opposite side.. I would definitely recommend staying here as i just love the place and the way it is maintained....",rmarkar,/Profile/rmarkar,"Thane, India",50

This is one of the best hotel, where you can stay with comforts of home. Decore was good, facilities were best. But the most good things were Padma, Namgyle and all the other staff. They were so good and helping. Attaching Padma's photo too.  And Boss you were the best. We liked the way you used to introduce the places before going there, so we could see that place that way. I told you at the time of our stay also that you seem to be Big, Carrying Brother, and really I mean it.  I loved your mother too. She was so cute.

Is centrally located...half a minute walk from famous Gesmo Restaurant (Should try lemon mint juice from there...Has Good WIFI too for free). It is a good bargain for someone who just need a bed to sleep and is out the whole day.  Has a semi-functional free WiFi....meaning when its working you need to step out of your room to connect (which is not bad...considering the options you have in leh). The food is very homely and tasty, though they have a limited menu.  I loved chicken curry and Dal Fry....! Staff is amazing!!! Friendly, Honest, Caring and happy faces!

Nothing to complaint about, but couldn't understand why women staffs in hotel carry luggages and gent staffs actually ask them to carry it !!! During check-in and check-out, both time we have seen it and my husband didn't allow them to carry our luggages as they were heavy.   Also don't know why during the entire stay wifi was not working.

Mr. Dehlex, the owner ensures that each guest is personally attended to, always willing to help people who often bombard him with questions about things to do in Ladakh. We stayed there in June, 2014 with a group of elderly Austrians. ""This is where we really loved to stay during our long tour"" commented the tour leader. We went to Nubra valley and a couple had to stay back because of illness. They were deeply touched by the way Mr. Dehlex would arrange a car for their visit to nearby hospital, arrange for medicine and appropriate food they needed most.
