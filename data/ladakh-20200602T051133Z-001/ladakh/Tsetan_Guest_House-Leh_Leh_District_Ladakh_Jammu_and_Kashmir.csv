ladakh,"This is a lovely family that makes everyone feel welcome and cared for. It’s well worth joining in for the home-cooked dinner, as they use fresh vegetables from their garden. During meals or over tea you’ll have a chance to socialize with an interesting variety of people with a wide range in age and nationality. ",Steph50357,/Profile/Steph50357,United States,50
ladakh,This home stay is in a quiet location in upper Changspa. The family is very helpful (took us to the hospital in the middle of the night!) and we feel like we are at home there (this is our second time staying here).

Tsetan and his family run the place in a very genuine, flexible and personal way and yet leave you all the freedom and privacy. They are all very sweet and caring.

ladakh,"I just spent three beautiful weeks with my friends in Ladakh. Having a home-base at Tsetan-Guesthouse was a very important factor for the great time we had - and writing home-base, I mean ""home""-base! Tsetan and his parents felt like a little, very warm-hearted family to us. Tsetan is extremly well-organized, helpful and flexible, he arranged transport (airport, hikes, trips to nubra valley...) and always managed to accomodate us in his guesthouse when we came back to Leh for some nights (we were also able to store some of our bagagge there while we were trekking).

ladakh,"We made Tsetan Guesthouse our home away from home in Ladakh for the month of July, while we ventured out on various treks, tours and monastery visits.   In many ways, Tsetan is like a homestay. From the moment you arrive, Tsetan and his family will make you feel at home, with lots of tea, comfortable living space and lots of advice about how to make the most of your visit. As we travelled to and from Leh, Tsetan was always flexible and accommodating. Even when we returned unexpectedly early from a trek and Tsetan was full, he walked us to another nearby guesthouse to set us up there until they had vacancy again. They even let us come back to use the space, use WiFi and eat dinner with them in the meantime, making us feel like it was still our home in Leh.

They are always working the hardest to provide for you in anything you need and I’ve had the best stay of my life at this place since it’s more like a home than any other guesthouse. Their little farm adorned with mountains and their two little dogs will be something I’ll always remember about this place. This is the place where you’ve not just come to a hotel and to roam around leh, this is the place that shares the local treasures of a Ladakhi family with you.

ladakh,"A home away from home, to make you feel welcome with a warm glass of freshly brewed mint tea. That is the best one line summary of what I can say about Tsetan and his family's homestay. I stayed here for a week and the whole family was so warm, smiling and welcoming. It felt like an authentic Ladakhi experience, especially since most other places were full of local tourists. This place is tucked away between the market and Shanti Stupa, about 15 mins walk from the start of the market. Lots of good eateries around as well like the German Bakery and Chanspa restaurant. The location is quiet, peaceful and Tsetan's garden and backwoods are a treat for the soul seeking some solitude in this holy place.

Anybody that knows anything about Leh will attest that it is not ideal for staying connected, because you pretty much can't get a temporary Sim card in the region and there are routine outages. All this said, Tsetan at Tsetan guest house was over accommodating for me and stopped at nothing to ensure I could be connected for my few night work calls. The family managing the guest house were so nice and made it easier that they could speak some English and help me navigate the city.

The homestay is located in a quiet area a short 10-15 min walk away from the town, with beautiful views of the Himalayas and the Shanti Stupa. His mum is honestly the best cook across all of Leh, (all vegetables are freshly grown in their garden) and she’s always found with a big smile to brighten your day, and his Dad is super lovely too. Rooms are clean, huge and very comfortable! Ladakh is a beautiful place, but this homestay made our trip here so much more memorable.

She made traditional Leh Momo’s for us on the last night of our stay with them.

Besides all the great infrastructure, that include hot water at any time, breakfast, dinner and free drinking water, Tsetan’s family make us feel home. They are such an amazing and warm-hearted people that made me feel part of the family too. Tsetan is also available to help us arrange trekkings and trips around Leh such as the Nubra Valley and Pangong Lake. There’s always great travelers around that can join each other’s schedule. His father is always ready to take us in a daily trip or get us to the airport (they also pick us up if arranged in advance).

The guest house is located on the Upper Changspa, a nice 20 minute walk away from the hustle and bustle of the town. Some say this is a hassle, but I found it to be a really nice thing to have this peaceful walk down the streets to the town. You have streams that run along the path, making it even more tranquil and beautiful (take the short cut - the prettiest route).  Tsetan is the nicest host I met so far, in my life.

This place is about fifteen min from the market but the guest house in itself is enveloped in a beautiful silence.Tsetan helped me plan the logistics of my travel around leh in a smooth way. Even those days that I had decided to simply stay put in the guest house were lovely.

Honestly, I have traveled in India for longer time, but this was the best homestay so far. Clean and neat place, good facilities, possibility to do your own laundry outside. Everything was great, but the hearty approach is all over it - they even remembered that we will come back from mountains so they kept a room for us (and they have always full) despite not knowing when we will come back.

It is a beautiful Ladakhi-Tibetan home up the main road from downtown Leh, in a quiet and peaceful residential neighborhood, fifteen minutes walk from Main Bazar. The guesthouse has simple, but lovely, private rooms and a small and nice dorm. The courtyard of the house is set amid a delightful garden, and maybe most beautiful of all is the family's kitchen and dining room, a truly gorgeous traditional Tibetan space.   The family is warm and welcoming, they will make you feel at home and will help you with your travel plans and needs.

Tsetan Guesthouse is located at the upper end of Changspa Road, and is a wonderful, quiet escape.  It is at a dead end, so you don't have any of the constant vehicle traffic.  The whole family is great.  One of the sons runs the business, the other takes care of visitor's activities beyond the guesthouse (from guiding treks to touring monasteries, he does it all).  The father has a mini-bus taxi service, and he, along with the mother and daughter, take care of the farm behind the guesthouse.

In discussion with him, he told me how bad Indian & Israeli tourists are and how he likes to avoid keeping them. He also mentioned that if he doesn't want anyone to stay he tells them wrong information about the location and distance of hostel from the market. I find this kind of practice very shady! Except for Tsetan, his family is great, very accommodating and hard working.

The spring makes it more into heavenly bliss.   From our rooms we can get a clear view of hills around, Shanti stupa and Leh palace.

I had good chats with Tsetan, who is really kind and accommodating (thanks for providing hot water for my shower at 10pm, bro!).

ladakh,"Coming back to Leh after a generation, the city has changed a lot. Yet the hospitality of its people remains spectacular. Tsetan's family and their guest house is, no doubt, the jewel in the crown. This is an amazing family which takes care of its guests as if they were part of it. Staying with them feels like home, and the attention they give to all details is astonishing. I loved the daily breakfasts and dinners, cooked with real love and passion; I loved the spacious rooms, and I loved coming back to the hot shower after a strenuous trek in Zanskar. Don't look any further - just make your way up to Upper Changspa, below the Shanty Stupa, and ease into the family life of Tsetan. No wonder the guest house is #1 on Tripadvisor - it is a real gem in the Himalaya. I will",Amit H,/Profile/390amith,"Bloomington, IN, United States",50

It really does feel like you're staying with your family (without any of the bickering that my family has). The view is beautiful, the area is quiet and relaxing, and the atmosphere is very friendly and communal. I plan to return to this place as soon as I can!

They do a set  breakfast and dinner which are good value and are served in a great communal lounge/dining room which is good for meeting other travellers.  The guest house is a bit out of the way, about 10mins to restaurants and 20mins to the main town, but we quite liked that, there is plenty of mountains (and cows!) to look at on the way.
