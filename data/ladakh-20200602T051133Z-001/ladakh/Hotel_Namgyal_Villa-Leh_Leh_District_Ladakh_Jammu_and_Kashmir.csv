ladakh,"Nice guesthouse, quiet and relaxing place with beautiful garden in the Nubra valley. Sumur monastery just nearby. We also had dinner here, good local food served by the friendly owners. A good place to stay if you travel to Nubra!",MelvinLee9,/Profile/MelvinLee9,"Singapore, Singapore",50
ladakh,"I really loved this place. This is a hidden gem in Sumoor and more people should know about it. The guest house is situated in a beautiful village, there are lovely flower beds in the front and a fabulous vegetable garden on the side. The owner picked the vegetables and cooked us our meals which were absolutely delicious. The power supply in Sumoor is finnicky, but they have a solar heater which picks up. The rooms are very spacious and clean.",usk,/Profile/usk,NY,50
ladakh,"We had our doubts while booking this property as it was not very sought after. But all our doubts were erased when we arrived there. The owner and the manager greeted us warmly and guided us to our rooms.  Being located in the model village of Sumoor, one would get to experience typical village life of the Ladakhi region. The environment inside the property is perfect to sit back and relax. Given that we paid nominal charge to book this, we were quite satisfied with the rooms. There was hot water facility throughout the day and this was vital during our visit here.  However, I think the hotel can attract more travelers if the rooms are qualitatively scaled up. Even though the lunch/dinner was delicious, we felt that it was a tad bit expensive. But excellent hospitality and",akshay_harish,/Profile/akshay_harish,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,"Overall: Probably the best place in Nubra Valley, if you discount food.  Pros: Location: A bit inside the village, but views are splendid. On the way to Samsteling Monastery Rooms: Large airy rooms, with hot water in the new block Garden: Huge garden with apple trees Hosts: Amazing, as usual in Ladakh. They even gave us apples when we were leaving.  Things to consider: Food: This time around, the food was a bit of a let down. Probably because they hired a new cook. Power: Sumur village doesn't has power only during 7:30 PM - 12 midnight. Only Deskit and Hunder have 24 hour power supply.",TusharKmr,/Profile/TusharKmr,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
ladakh,"We had booking in Skitsal Resort which is nearby this guest house. But when we reached there, it was locked and no one was there. We got stranded for few minutes then started searching for hotel and found this guest house. The property is good looking. Surrounded by apple trees and rose beds. Rooms are big and well ventilated, nice and clean bed. Big toilet with running hot-cold water.The lady owner of the GH received us with a smile. They had no servants or cook, because they are about to close for winter. However, the lady and her husband cooked lunch for us at 2.30 p.m. Even they plucked apple from the tree and gave us. Its better than Kashmir apple. We had sumptuous dinner in the evening. It was an excellent experience altogether.",A Tripadvisor Member,/Profile/null,India,40
ladakh,"I walked into this hotel. One of the budget options in Sumoor. Family owned place but run by Nepali manager and his team. I stayed there for two nights. Room itself is quite big overlooking the garden. Location is peaceful and about 400 mts from the main road/junction where you get dropped off by bus. Place seems popular with package tourists (most hotels in Sumoor and Hundur are!).  They have good buffet lunch and breakfast...not too expensive but not cheap either. Since Sumoor does not have many places to eat out, getting good food at the hotel was important.",Charaveti,/Profile/Charaveti,"Bengaluru, India",40
