ladakh,"It's a good hotel and view from suite is amazing, but the location is in middle of street / buildings. Rooms and washrooms were neat and clean. Staff was polite and the manager went out of the way to help us as there were some booking issues due to our agent. Food was decent. Overall a pleasent stay.

ladakh,"Excellent stay at Yasmin. The staff is great, the food is great and the location is also great! We had a 14 day trip organised by their travel agency Yasmin trek & tours. The whole trip was amazing. Prakash took great care of us and was always very accommodating, thoughtful and friendly.  Our driver Singay was better than we could have asked for, really lovely man. Due to a change in weather condition we were even able to re-arrange and shift days/activities within our programme. I highly recommend using Yasmin trek & tours and staying at their hotel.",Clara_Pascale,/Profile/Clara_Pascale,"London, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,Wonderful hotel with all amenities. Took a 8 Day package with them - worked out very well. staff are very courteous - available at all times. Food was good and the restaurant staff too were very courteous - never say NO to any of the guest request. Highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning to visit Leh with family and friends.,GokulChandran,/Profile/GokulChandran,"Hyderabad, India",50
ladakh,"I have been to Ladakh few years back and then stayed at this Hotel and now this year has been a real New Property. It's not actually the renovated but a new Hotel, luxurious, affordable and comfortable.",Thoba f,/Profile/Thobaf,,50
ladakh,"We were shocked to see so many mosquitoes in the room. After a while, we could not stay there and we shifted to adjacent hotel. Very Terrible Place. Caretaker also doesn't care about guest and cleanliness. AVOID.",Sauank,/Profile/Sauank,"New Delhi, India",10
ladakh,"Basic and comfortable stay in Leh. Good for night halts when you spend most of the day sightseeing. Its just 5 mins walk to the main Fort road where all the action is - cafes, eating joints, shopping etc.   The entire booking process and interaction with Mr Shahid Latif was wonderful.   However, the on ground staff (especially the manager) needs a major overhaul - out-rite lazy, commercial minded and only there to act as a middleman to earn commission.   other staff - Shankar and Pawan are very hard-working and do all the job.",Priyanka2010,/Profile/Priyanka2010,"Bengaluru, India",30
ladakh,Good Hotel. Rooms are very good in moderate price. The staff are very good and service is good. We have 14 people in a group and stayed there 7 nights and we found good stay and homely atmosphere. Location wise also good nearer to market. Lastly I can good choice Hotel Yasmin,TapashPal,/Profile/TapashPal,"Kolkata, India",40
ladakh,"If you are traveling to Ladakh with less than 2 weeks in hand, chances are you will spend more time outside of Leh than in it. In this situation all you need is a place that can act as an anchor, and Hotel Yasmin was a great one at that for us.  At 1000 bucks/ night for twin sharing, the hotel takes care of most basics that other places in Leh dont. They have 24 hr hot water in the bathrooms, the loos are clean if very basic. The bedsheets were dirty, but we asked for clean ones and they were quickly replaced. The staff here is very helpful, and arranged all our tours for us at very competitive prices. Special word for Prakash, who's the manager here. He really took good care of us.   If you aren't fussy about being in a luxury place (there aren't any real luxury hotels in Leh",SimChan,/Profile/SimChan,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"A simple and comfortable stay in the little town of Leh. I stayed with my family for 5 days and the stay was comfortable. situated close to all the action- cafes, restaurants, shops makes it ideal!  ask for a room on the top level of the BB as most of the lower level rooms have windows facing houses and behinds of shops which makes you feel like your privacy is invaded.  the bed is comfortable and perfect by BB standards!  there is a small green patch in the central part of the BB where you can sit and enjoy tea and snacks or just sit and breathe the fresh mountain air.  Around the hotel, you can find many restaurants and cafes.. Do try the Tibetan Kitchen & Summer Harvest for delicious Tibetan delicacies or the rooftop Chinese restaurant called Chopticks (something) bang",SandeepSaxena-IIP,/Profile/SandeepSaxena-IIP,"Dehradun, India",50
ladakh,"Location: Good. Very close to market/main city yet in a quiet location away from the main road Views: No great view of the surrounding ranges Price: Affordable (Rs. 1,000 for twin room) Staff: Friendly. They arrange for taxis to various sights, if required",dhruvtandan,/Profile/dhruvtandan,Hyderabad,30
ladakh,"An affordable base for trekking and touring around Leh. The hotel is close to Fort Road so is convenient for the town. The hotel is built around a prtty garden and the room had great view. It was a simple room and suffered a liitle from end-of-season fatigue (early October), with a light bulb and socket not working. But that was not a problem, the room was clean and fresh. The staff were very friendly, tea was available o n demand and we used them to arrange a car for days out at good prices. The cars were new and the drivers were knowledgeable and accommodating. I will definitely use the Hotel Yasmin next time I visit Leh.",lpLondon359,/Profile/lpLondon359,"London, United Kingdom",40
ladakh,"This is a simple hotel in Leh, not expensive, in a garden location just near Fort Road but quiet.",indigo628,/Profile/indigo628,"Hamburg, Germany",30
ladakh,"pro: got a nice room at the second floor with window facing to the snow capped mountains. spacious bed room, comfy bed and warm blanket and attached bathroom with hot shower. personal feeling: the staff are helpful, nice and friendly, especially prakash who look after us and asking what we need without pushy senses. con: carpet on the floor look dated, my humble opinion, it will still nice without carpet since whenever we step out from the bathroom, our wet feet will give damp contribution into its carpet.",ukirsari,/Profile/ukirsari,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",30
ladakh,"Ladak is really a place to visit, at least once in a lifetime. The places in Leh, Monasteries, Pangong lake and Nubra Valley are incredible. I landed in this hotel by Chance as one of my friends recommended me. This hotel is very nice, excellent location, clean; Service is very good and Shahid the Hotel owner is a nice person himself. I Loved stayin in this hotel, though it was just for few days.",caringtraveler,/Profile/caringtraveler,New Jersey,40
ladakh,"We came to Leh on the day of the big floods (August 2010) and were forced to spend some days in this hotel. The owner, who lives in the hotel building as well, decided to use the hotel generator by himself. This made all the hotel guests spend the evenings in the dark, while the family of the owner was watching TV and enjoying itself. We were made to pay the full bill when we could leave Leh, even though the website clearly states that this hotel has electricity and generators in emergency cases.  Staff remained very gently and helpfull, but I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone due to the attitude of the owners. I would strongly recommend you to search for another hotel, the owners do not feel any responsibility for their guests at all.  If you have to stay at this hotel, do",firefairy1981,/Profile/firefairy1981,"Voorburg, The Netherlands",10
ladakh,"I like this hotel - it is off Fort road and in a quiet area, but still 5 minutes walk from all the shops, restaurants, travel agents and cloe to the airport. I have stayed there several times. It has a garden and the rooms/ bathrooms are large. The decorations and furnishings are basic but the price is OK. The rooms open onto a common verandah where you can sit and read in the mountain sun in peace. It is a modern building but that means it has a waterproof roof which has been great when the weather is very wet and ceilings leak as in some older hotels!!",nom001,/Profile/nom001,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",30
