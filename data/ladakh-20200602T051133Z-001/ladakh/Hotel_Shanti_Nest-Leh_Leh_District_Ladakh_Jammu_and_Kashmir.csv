ladakh,"It is my 4th visit to Ladakh and out of the 4 times, I have stayed in Shanti for the last three times. I have to say the newly finished Shanti Nest is one of best hotels I have stayed in India.   The rooms are comfortable. There are a small balcony with chairs. The bed and the blanket are so comfortable to sleep.I love the dinning hall too. It is huge and the buffet food serviced is excellent.  Besides, wifi, hot shower water, Sony LED cable TV are all available. It is really a good place no matter if you just arrive Leh before you go to exploring Ladakh or if you just want to be relax in Leh. The receiption and manager will provide all the informations about Ladakh. The helpers will carry your big luggage up to your room.  You also can find some heartwarming booklets about AMS,",SeanXu,/Profile/413seanx,"Leh, India",50

ladakh,"We stayed 1 night in this property. The rooms, fittings, washroom, cleaniness would beat any other 5 star hotels in Leh! The owner is also very humble and approachable! We got rooms on the 3rd floor, lovely view!  Food is also good!  Service is also excellent!",Anuja_Kothari,/Profile/Anuja_Kothari,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,Stayed here in winters of 2018.  Happened to come across this lovely abode while coming down from shanti stupa.  Great things: lovely views of peaks with early morning sun shining on peaks. Forest on backside.  Very comfortable. Centrally heated. Balconies to enjoy the landscape. Terrace to enjoy starry night but lights from nearby airfield distract.  Away from any market but an army cafe is not very far away.   Things to improve: food. Quite bland :)  Highly recommended especially in winters.,Shashank B,/Profile/ShashankB174,,40
ladakh,"In February 2019 we were fortunate enough to have enjoyed the hospitality of both Shanti Home and Shanti Nest. Both the places had their distinct nuances.  Generally speaking, we had fairly good experience staying at Shanti Nest as well as Shanti Home. Rigzhin, the chief of staff (supervisor-manager) was resourceful and considerate. He was enthusiastic, active and knowledgeable. Ahmed was ever helpful, gentle and soft spoken. Cooks provided specific items as per your needs. Even in the scarcity and harshness of winter they managed to procure fresh vegetables and salad for us. And it is ideally situated a little away from din and noise of the city. Food is palatable with a lot of variety. We cannot eat much of the spicy food and good thing was that the food was not excessively",Shelika Gaur,/Profile/Shelika_Gaur,,50
ladakh,"I must appreciate & thanks Mr. Rigzin Gurmet, manager, Hotel Shanti nest for our superb stay experience with them. The Hotel is beautifully structured with spacious rooms, wonderful wall paintings & smiling service staff. Leh rich culture is well depicted in its structure & paintings. Do plan to stay here if you are planning to stay at Leh. #5STARS",Sanchit,/Profile/agsanchit,,50
ladakh,"Situated near to the airport and just below the Shanti stupa, hotel Shanti Nest is one of the finest place to stay in the area. With the new building having all the necessities required to stay. Food provided in breakfast and dinner was up to the mark, the central heating system makes it more welcoming, the sceneric views from the room window are treat to wake up to. Staff is super helpful and makes all the requirements regarding your visit to various places super easy. Special thanks to the hotel manager Mr. Gurmeet for his tireless duty towards every guest.",er.vikas,/Profile/Soultraveller4ever,,50
ladakh,"Located on Changspa road and with Shanti Stupa just 15 minutes of walking distance, is a beautiful and comfortable stay The Shanti Nest. The property is new and well designed, with spacious and airy rooms. The room comes with all the basic amenities which makes your stay comfortable. The place is operational throughout the year, as its centrally heated. The rooms overlook at the beautiful Stok Kangri range, so sip some hot beverage and enjoy the serenity of the valley. The staff is very helpful and Mr. Ahmed always entertained our requests with a smile. We thoroughly enjoyed our Ladakhi styled welcome to the hotel with ”Khadag” (The white silk scarf). The food is very delicious and homely, with the options of customization. Tea and coffee can be served to your rooms on request",imprash_p,/Profile/imprash_p,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"A warm and cozy place to stay in Leh with all necessary amenities required. The best part was the hospitality offered by their staff - Mr. Gurmet made sure that even our small requests were looked after - from arranging a weighing scale to even a translator who had assisted us during our field trip. Mr Ahmed, their chef and all others were very warm and helpful. Our rooms (on the second floor) were very cozy and offered beautiful views of the city as well as snow cladded mountains. I strongly recommend Hotel Shanti Nest - you need not think twice - Just go for it! :)",NB_CUE,/Profile/NB_CUE,,50
ladakh,"My stay at Shanti nest was super comfortable and enjoyable. Considering i visited in march, all the necessities like hot running water, central heating, fresh food was 24*7 available. The whole staff esp Mr Gurmet, Mr ahmad, the restaurant caretaker and others were super warm and helpful. The rooms are super clean and cosy. I would highly recommend this property to anyone visiting Leh if you are seeking comfort interwined with culture.",karishma67,/Profile/karishma67,"Jammu and Kashmir, India",50
ladakh,"Shanti Guesthouse looks cosy and friendly, but then you have not seen Shanti Nest, the newly built hotel by the same owner, Dorjey. :-)  Rooms look like temples, with beautiful paintings on the wall, very spacious and clean, and all the rooms have central heating and hot water in evenings and mornings. There is only wifi on the first floor. We especially enjoyed the amazing Indian (but not spicy!) food, cooked with love by the friendliest cook ever (soup and desert included). And the staff was very helpful as well.  The hotel is at a 10 minutes drive from the center of Leh in a quiet neighborhood overlooking the valley. Taxi's and excursions can easily be booked. We recommend the Lamayuru and Hemis Monastery.  Take good precautions for altitude disease: two days of absolute rest",Anne W,/Profile/AnneWislez,,50
ladakh,"It was my first time in Ladakh and in India. I was worried about where to stay but Shanti Nest provided top-knotch service. The room is very comfortable, staffs are friendly and helpful, and food is okay (breakfast and dinner included). If anyone is looking for a place to stay, I recommend Hotel Shanti Nest.",Bin,/Profile/binsplace,,50
ladakh,"We stayed at Shanti Nest in Feb 2019 during our visit to Leh for Chadar Trek.  Newly constructed hotel at a very good location with centralized heating in room and also bathroom. Market around 10 min walk.  Superior Room quality and beyond our expectations. Very hospitable Restaurant staff. Good Buffet spread for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. Admirable food quality for all the meals. Ready to serve attitude of all entire staff. No complaints at all. Look forward to staying at Shanti Nest again during our next visit to Leh.

ladakh,I visited this place in beginning of January 2019 when it was chilling cold and  found this place cozy and complete. Rooms had hot water for bath through out the day. Rooms are equipped with heaters as well bathrooms.  It is close to Shanti stupa and surrounded by mountains.  I do not have any complaint wrt to food as well.   So overall if you are visiting leh you can choose to stay if you are looking for a place which is value for money.,JenaAdventure,/Profile/JenaAdventure,"Bilekahalli, India",50
ladakh,"we stayed in 2 hotels at Leh, one the Shanti and other the Munshi at the city center. The Shnati is near the Shanti Stupa, so a bit remote however rooms very new and clean, great shower, and even OK Wifi at the Lobby. We moved to the Munshi to be at the city center, rooms with very basic quality and auful shower. I would preffer the romote one and take taxi back up for 250Ruppi.. Breakfats and dinner are included and the stuff is great and helpful.",mnaor,/Profile/mnaor,Israel,50
ladakh,"I had always been looking forward to a road trip....and this August finally made it to Leh(Ladakh) with friends. We stayed at this amazing property which is new and extremely beautiful. The highlight of the property was the team managing it. Kudos to the manager(Rohit). We were overwhelmed by his professional behaviour and the dedication towards the guest. Despite of some inconvenience like no lift(soon to be started, as it's already installed), he ensured that all our needs were fulfilled. And ofcourse the food at this hotel was the best throughout our trip. We wish this hotel and the staff a very bright future. Thank you for making our stay a memorable one.",ashishpwanderer,/Profile/ashishpwanderer,"Ranipool, India",50

ladakh,"In June along with my friends booked this beautiful property which had spacious rooms, clean and neat bathrooms, and of course very good hospitality by Manager Rohit. Food was superb for all the 4 days of our stay. If you are in Leh staying here is worth your money.",Jitesh L,/Profile/JiteshL8,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"New hotel with big rooms and excellent food. Amazing staff who went out of their way to make our stay comfortable. The Chief of hotel staff (Rohit) was almost superhuman in the lengths he went to ensure every request was catered to in the best possible manner. Not many views available from the hotel, but the warmth and support of the team was super. All the best for their future.",Atul,/Profile/abterrific,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
ladakh,"Our travel agent had booked this hotel as part of our package. This is newly built and was very clean. We had a really pleasant stay here. The rooms are spacious, modern with a nice sitting area by the window. The food was excellent. The entire staff was very helpful and friendly. Location was a nice, quiet spot below the Shanti Stupa, a 10-15 min walk to the market. Would come back and stay again!",Neha15s,/Profile/Neha15s,"New York City, New York",50
ladakh,"Our agent had booked this for us during our last leg of the Leh tour. We stayed here only for 1 night, before catching a flight back home.  We were pretty exhausted at the end of the tour, and were glad to find rooms with nice comfortable beds. The rooms were spacious and tidy with central air conditioning.",karthik0410,/Profile/karthik0410,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"A nice place to be in , if you are visiting Ladhak in winter, central heating, hot water and very spacious and nice rooms. Slightly far from Leh market which is quite good as you dont have to go through the crowded market area.  Niki, the front desk manager, so very helpful and full of simple and warmth like a true ladhaki.",mahapatrachandan,/Profile/mahapatrachandan,"Bengaluru, India",50
