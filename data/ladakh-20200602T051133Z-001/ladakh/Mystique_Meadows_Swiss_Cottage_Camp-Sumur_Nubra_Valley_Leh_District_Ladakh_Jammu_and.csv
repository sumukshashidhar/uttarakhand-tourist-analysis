They grow the vegetables and cook it fresh, very enjoyable. It is a Camp with well equipped tents.

ladakh,"I stayed in this hotel with of my friends during our Leh trip in August 2014 for one night. We had two cottages booked for six of us. I booked this resort through a travel agent in advance.  Well, before I write further, I would like to clear few doubts, which I have been asked many times.   It is a tent accommodation. These tents are big enough. As you enter, you have a small area where there are two chairs and a table, here you can relax and have cup of tea.  Further you enter, that is the bedroom. There you will have two or three beds. Well, beds occupy most of the area in bedroom but still you have little room left for your luggage and other things. There is no cupboard in bedroom, so you have to keep everything in your bags only. But mostly people stay for only one night",Kunal Rane,/Profile/Kunal_J_Rane,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"A comfortable stay in the beautiful tents set up in an attractive atmosphere. The vegetable garden around the tents are something we have to learn to utilize best the available space. Moreover it was very pleasing to hear that they used the fresh vegetables from the gardens for the restaurant there, Food was very tasty and the soup served was a comforting one for the cold weather outside.",bushrahamed1210,/Profile/bushrahamed1210,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"We, group of friends, planned to stay at Nubra, the cold desert, for a day and at least take the camping feel. Everyone suggested us about this place and the type of Swiss cottages it had. And in a place like Leh, one tends to go for the proven stuff rather than making their own choices. When we reached there, it was more of a disaster for us, seeing the tents in such state. I agree that we had not been in the best season, but still the tents were in a poor state, with the cloth torn at places, washrooms not that clean. The staff was helpful as they agreed to shift us to the rooms available and gave quick and good service. The food was very good, as they have their own farming. It was a village kind of feel for us, and I would personally not suggest anyone to stay there,",suchitbangur,/Profile/suchitbangur,"Nagpur, India",20
ladakh,"The camp is beautiful, with lot of plants - flowers and vegetables. Had fresh apricots directly plucked from trees. It is surrounded by mountains, which look beautiful. Tent is comfortable, clean. In August, blankets were enough to keep us warm. Electricity is available only till 11pm, after which you have to rely on a battery operated torchlight, provided in the tent.  Food is good. Dining area is hard-built, hence cozy and comfortable.  Nothing much to do here. Sumur is a small quiet village. There is a monastery closeby - worth a visit.  Special thanks to Sandeep. He is very helpful. Cons: Location is a bit far (20-25km) from Hundur sand dunes. Taxis charge a little extra for going to Sumur.",buzzmanish,/Profile/buzzmanish,"Mumbai, India",50

ladakh,"In Ladakh you are in the lap of god's own wonderland everywhere, but during my stay at Mystique Meadows I felt even more closer. Just narrow two footed walkway to the Swiss tents, both side flooded with vegetation and flowers felt special. Just outside ur tent you have sunflowers welcoming you to come out in the day light after a cozy sleep at night, Fresh organic vegetation just opposite to ur tent, just felt more closer to nature. Best of all : they serve you the freshly cut veggies, which they grow in front of ur tents, amazing organic touch to the staying experience.the food feels so fresh, the aroma, the taste, all added to the magical feel in the Nubra valley.

ladakh,"The pleasant vegetable gardens here are a real treat. In season the chef can just pick what he wants. We had a few problems with all of the zippers in our tent not working and the hot water knob was broken but the staff responded quickly and was able to fix these problems. It's just not something one wants to deal with after the long drive from Leh. Overall the staff was superb and wanted to ensure everything was satisfactory. The camp is a bit far from town and has no internet access. But, one can wander the many paths through the fields nearby. This is a very tranquil place as the result of it being far from everything. The food is ok, but caters to ""western"" needs so much that it is a little bland for us.",AdventurePhiles,/Profile/AdventurePhiles,"Dallas, Texas",40
ladakh,Excellent tented accommodation in the scenic village of Sumur. Sumur is nice location to explore the Nubra valley including the famous Hunder and Diksit monasteries. The tents are set among poplar and willow trees amidst fields where local vegetables are grown. The staff is friendly and the food is great. The tents have running cold and hot water. Fresh vegetables from the fields are cooked into delicious meals.,Vikas Singh,/Profile/curatorofmemories,"Hyderabad, India",50
ladakh,"The camp has nice tents and is situated in a garden where you can see the vegetables grow you can taste later on at dinner. Very nice and helpful staff. Food is good but nothing special. There could be more light in the tents. As allover in Ladakh there is a terrible dog barking at night, but I guess you cannot change this in he short run...Very cold at night but bearable with hot bags.",clegoldberg,/Profile/clegoldberg,Berlin,40

It was like a small cute suite with a very beautiful attached balcony with each tents..Their own vegetable gardens surrounding the camps made it look more lovely..

ladakh,One of the best tents we have ever stayed. We visited these camps during July 2013 and would say our experiences were just great. Spacious tents amidst a beautiful garden with greenery all around. You can listen to the gushing winds in the late evening or early morning. Food was tasty and fresh vegetables procured from their own garden. Very friendly staff who gave us a pleasant stay at Nubra.

ladakh,"Nubra valley is the flower valley of Ladakh and to truly experience is you must stay at mystique meadows!  We reached there after a day long bumpy ride from Leh and doing pit stop every now and then.  But as soon as you enter the camps you forget all the exhaustion!  Its a group of about 30 camps/tents in small clusters which is surrounded by a beautiful garden where they grow rosemary, cabbage and other fruits and flowers! Its simply beautiful.  All this landscaped by peaks surrounding the Nubra valley, the setting cant be more picturesque!   They have also a basic restaurant that is great on hospitality and they use locally produced herbs and vegetables quite a lot which is amazing!  The tents are big  (about 120 sq feet) and well appointed with each having an attached toilet",Dhaval Thakker,/Profile/Dhaval_the_explorer,"Vadodara, India",50
ladakh,"We spent one night here during our trip to Nubra valley. Many tented camps have sprung up as a cheap alternative to hotels.  The tents are fine. They are tents. Keep the flaps closed to keep the insects outs. The bathrooms are basic (with a toilet, wash basin and bucket shower). Warm water was supposed to be available from 6:30 but it was ice-cold. Electricity is available from 19:30 - 22:30 if I remember correctly so take a couple of torches. There is a battery lamp in each tent. We slept very well.  The garden is lovely and we spent a few nice hours just sitting outside and reading, not really much else to do there anyway.  Staff are very friendly and very attentive. They were happy to bring tea to the tent but didn't offer any snacks. The dinner was excellent, the cook really",apfelwein,/Profile/apfelwein,"Frankfurt, Germany",40

A very basic place with no wardrobe, very basic WC and bathroom (it was clean though) but the beauty of the place was outside the tent... well maintained garden, in house vegetable plantations & awesome weather. However the food was very average, pasta which was the only highlight of the buffet was over as soon as we started with our food.  The breakfast was as bad as it gets.... We stuck to the omelette bread since everything else wasn't edible. Service and staff were good but that was the only good thing and deserves a positive feedback.",Priyesh10,/Profile/Priyesh10,"Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,"They are simple tents, devoid of a 'Wash Basin'. Yes they do have a bath area, but no basin. Don't understand their logic. They served us 'JAIN FOOD' giving the reason that majority of the guests that night were Jain. The cook was always lethargic, unwilling to prepare snacks for us at 5 in the evening saying that he was busy preparing the dinner.Finally when he agreed to give us some 'Pakoras', they were tasteless, i.e., devoid of salt. The staff does need to be taught some manners. They need to be more hospitable! I personally had a very poor experience at this place. I would instead recommend staying at Hotel Stan-Del at Diskit if you want to stay in the Nubra Valley!",UmangPhotographer,/Profile/UmangPhotographer,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",10

The tents are neatly divided into 3 sections with the front one being like a small front space with table, chairs where you can sit to sip your tea. then there is bedroom & the end there is washroom.

ladakh,"If you go to Mystique Meadows expecting 3 star or even a 2 star hotel experience (like I did), you will be sorely disappointed. This is not a place for a family outing - our tent lacked a wash basin (the toilet is a basic WC + hand shower), no wardrobe or even a place to hang clothes either in the bedroom or in the toilet, no mirror (either in the toilet or in the bedroom). Forget about a room heater or TV - not even in the common dining room. We checked out other tents as well, but they were all the same. There was no registration process as well, which I found very strange, but didn't affect us. We reached the camp around 5:00 pm and were hungry, but the only thing we got was a flask of hot tea and some sandwiches. There was no electricity when we reached there and had to wait",ToffeeTour,/Profile/ToffeeTour,"Bengaluru, India",20

And then a  suprise awaits you, Especially  as all the tents  are PLONK in the middle of a vegetable  garden. (Wheat/ sweet peas/ Cabbage/ peas/ brinjal / carrot etc etc ) BUT, after a few minutes of  soaking in the place, you realise, its  GOOD! The tents are comfortable, the staff MORE than willing to help, and a decent enough location to walk around for a stroll. There is nothing really to see here.

It offers many scenic views for photography especially during dusk and dawn. Make the most of the early morning and twilight by moving around.

Right outside our tent was a small patio type place with a table to and chairs to while away your evenings in this beautiful desert. They also arrange for all types of drinks you want, in the middle of the desert!  They also grow their own vegetables :)  Also, there is a cute little stream flowing through the place and its sheer joy to watch.
