ladakh,"We stayed here for 1N. Lamayuru is a very small town on the way to Leh, so don't expect great amenities from any property here. Having said that - the family at Fotola does really well to provide the basic necessities & accommodate any requests. They will typically need to go out and buy things if you have a special request for food - so let them know in advance. The electricity in the town is erratic but Fotola has power back-up - always a good thing!",AbhinavDave,/Profile/AbhinavDave,"New Delhi, India",40

ladakh,"we stayed there on 15 June night.  it is near to main leh  highway , feels bit secluded but actually not.  It was amazingly maintained guest house, room interior and bathroom was very basic but neat and clean. Bed was very cozy. property is situated near to famous monestory  and near to lunar escape land i.e. sometimes called moon land.  food was delicious and was  served in big dinning hall . over all experience was comfortable and memorable. i would like to stay here again and again",akkibaba,/Profile/akkiyadav,India,40
ladakh,"The Hotel is quite far away from the Monastery, inside the village. I booked it after reading the reviews, but it has a shabby look around it..the room does have attached bath, but that was it. No running hot water, I was offered hot water in bucket -- not sure, may be because I visited in end May...may be season had not yet started for them? However, they also asked for quite high rates for the room. Finally we ditched this hotel and found a much better room in a hotel much more near to the monastery",Suman123,/Profile/Suman123,"Bengaluru, India",30
ladakh,"While looking for accommodation at Lamayuru, I managed to get the mobile no. 09469048470 of Mr. Sonam Spalzang, the owner and booked the hotel for 14th August, 2014 - for 01 night stay. We were 20 people(19 Guests from Malaysia) travelling from Kargil to Lamayuru and arrived around 3 pm. Sonam and his wife were there to receive us. Within no time, they prepared lunch for us and helped the group check in. He also arranged for 02 rooms in  nearby Lamayuru Monastery Guest House for 02 of the visitors, helped them to the Guesthouse in his car. The hotel rooms were clean with attached bathrooms and toilets. Hot water boiler to ensure running hot water and a diesel  Genset for power back up. An uphill walk of 15 minutes  to Lamayuru  monastery through the village was a nice",KhushalJaswal,/Profile/KhushalJaswal,"Shimla, India",50
