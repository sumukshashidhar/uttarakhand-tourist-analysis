ladakh,"We were a group of 9 ladies on a week long vacation at Ladakh. One of the best things to have happened was the stay for 3 nights at Lha Ri sa and meeting Tashi Motup, his mm and his team! Their hospitality is par excellence and we had a absolutely smashing time. Tashi is very passionate about Ladakh and he personally took us around to see the fresh water springs. Our first two nights in Leh were spent in the deluxe rooms which are spacious and well maintained. The last night was in the tree house which is fabulous. The property  has a number of fruit trees -apples and apricots --which were deliious and Tashi was generous with us:)Thank you so much for a wonderful time.

ladakh,This place for nowhere close to the reviews mentioned here. We were given the tree house which was surrounded by tall tree which blocked all the good views of Leh. The room or the patio did not get enough sunlight and it was so chilled inside as compared to the lovely weather outside. The toilets were dirty and leaking. The worst part was the food. They would give you whatever they feel like with no choices. They will not even serve anything from menu with lame excuses. No one stays at the hotel during the day mostly since they are traveling to places around Leh and might not have experienced the horrible services they offer. It's better to stay in a cheaper home stays if you have to travel around for the entire day. The only good thing about this place is that it is not so far,Kundan S,/Profile/169kundans,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",20

Only a fortunate few stayed in Welcom Heritage Lha-Ri-Sa Resort, managed by the welcoming Mr Tashi Motup Kau and his extremely hospitable team led by Mr Norbu take extremely good care of you and make you feel at home. In fact the Hotel is an extension of Mr Mr Tashi's family home.  High altitude sickness is a very serious possibility at Leh. The hosts ensure that you do not undertake the tour in a hurry and encourage you to take it easy on your first day there so that you get acclimatized.
