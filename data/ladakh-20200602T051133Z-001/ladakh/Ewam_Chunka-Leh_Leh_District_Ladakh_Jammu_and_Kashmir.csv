ladakh,"We stayed at this guesthouse for almost a month. Part of the time with friends. We loved it. Great location, beautiful view from the balconies of the new building (there is an old one which looked okay but we did not stay in it). Very reasonably priced. Hot showers and spacious rooms. Highly recommend.",Nurit,/Profile/NuritP16,,50

The rooms have no fans which is something you will never ask for in Leh given the single temperature the ventilation is good enough to keep you freezing as if you in a deluxe AC room.

ladakh,"Though Ewam Chunka is suppose to be a home stay, it is more of a hotel. Manager Shiva was always there for any help we needed. The hotel is very well located with best restaurants nearby. The Leh market, hospital and cafes are all at a walking distance from the hotel. The rooms are spacious, clean and nice.",Ankit M,/Profile/177ankitm,"Mumbai, India",40

ladakh,"Location: -	On Shanti Stupa road just behind Hotel Aisa, 1 min walk from the main road.  -	12-15 mins stroll from the main market.  -	8-10 mins from the various shops selling woolens and organizing trips and tours on shanti stupa road.   Rooms: -	Rooms in the new wing are pretty good (have not seen the old building rooms), will say best among all the nearby hotels/guest houses. They are were recently done and are quite big enough and also has an attached balcony.  -	You get a clear view of the mountains as there is no construction behind this property. Balcony is east facing and hence in the morning you can sit there with a cup of tea enjoying the view of mountains and sound of a stream flowing right below.  -	The Bathroom are also quite big with latest fitments and has hot",madhur l,/Profile/madhurl2015,"Mumbai, India",50
