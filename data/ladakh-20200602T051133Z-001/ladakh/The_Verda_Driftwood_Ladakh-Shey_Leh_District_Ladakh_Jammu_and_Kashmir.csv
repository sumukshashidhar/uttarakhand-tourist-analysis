ladakh,"I stayed here with other friends/collegues for 12 days from September 1,2019, and I truly enjoyed this hotel. Compare to other hotel I stayed 3 years ago when I first came here in laddak, this hotel is like a luxury one. Everything seemed to work smoothly - hot water was running on scheduled time, the staff were very polite and helpful, rooms were clean and the food from the restaurant was amazing. The best part of this hotel is being LGTBIQ friendly. As a gay traveller having to feel welcomed is the best thing they can do for their guest without feeling discriminated. The area Shey is about 20 min drive from little town Leh, but the surrounding villages make up for it, the tree lined road was great for walking and there are monasteries close by to visit.The hotel arranged",JMJ,/Profile/travellersky2,,50

The staff is minimal but are always helpful warm and pleasant.A special mention for Divyansh and Aman.Very very helpful. One suggestion would be to keep BSNL sims on rental basis as not every guest has an Airtel connection .Vodafone doesn‚Äôt work even on roaming.The hotel wifi is extreme poor but can be overlooked.
