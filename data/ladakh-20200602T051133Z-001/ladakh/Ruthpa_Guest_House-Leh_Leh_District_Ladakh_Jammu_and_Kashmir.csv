ladakh,"Mr Konchok and his family were really great and friendly hosts during my two week stay in Leh. Their natural and genuine care touched my heart, so sweet. The rooms are good and clean, and offers hot shower. Herbal tea is served all day long. Breakfast is included, and dinner can be offered. Dinner is homemade Indian/Tibetan style, and often based on organic produce from their own garden. The location offers a great view to the mountains, and is outside of the town centre of Leh, which makes it much more quiet. I highly recommend the place!",Vibhoda,/Profile/Vibhoda,"Eastern Norway, Norway",50
ladakh,"My children and I had a most wonderful time! At walking distance from the centre, the guesthouse is very clean and comfortable, with a lovely garden. Kamal and his family are amazing hosts: friendly and super helpful. The food is also superb!",Navigator315216,/Profile/Navigator315216,,50

ladakh,"I loved my stay at Ruthpa Guesthouse. It's in a lovely location just outside of the busy centre of Leh, but only a 15 minute stroll down laneways to get to the main market. The room was spacious and clean, showers were hot, and I had the most wonderful view of the Stok Kangri peak from my room. But best of all was the warmth, kindness and hospitality of Kamal and the family. The were incredibly accommodating and helpful, as I was coming and going exploring different parts of Ladakh. But a room and a smile were always waiting for me on my return. I can't recommend Ruthpa Guesthouse enough - if you are travelling through Leh you should definitely consider staying here.",Kerrie B,/Profile/583kerrieb,"Sydney, Australia",50
ladakh,"I completely agree with the other reviews - a great place to stay in Leh in which you will be part of the family. The guesthouse has great clean rooms with a good, hot, shower. The views from the patio are fab but the best bit are the family that own the place - they are all completely lovely, and super helpful. Good food from the huge veg patch - a top to stay. Highly recommended.",Miles B,/Profile/165milesb,"London, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"My stay in Ruthpa was as a stay at home: I felt so comfortable with the family, they are really wwelcoming me as a member of it. The rooms are clean and lightly, the outside view is just breathtaking: Stock Kangri, Shanti Stupa, Leh castle... yes we can see that just next to your room. It is located a little bit up to the main streets of Leh, about 15 minutes by walk. That's why you can feel in a little village when you seat on a chair on the nice garden of the guest house... So pleasant to enjoy these moments in Ruthpa.  Moreover, the breakfast are very good, omelet, chapati, jam, and a delicious mint tea! I really advise you this place, not expensive and so welcoming for your stay in Leh!",Pauline L,/Profile/paulinel273,,50
ladakh,"The best place you want to stay in Leh!!! Homemade food, all vegetable from mami ji garden, renovated room just last year, internet, about 15 minutes to reach downtown Leh and all facilities...an incredible viw on Stock Kangri and Markha range....The whola family is exceptionnal, you can have your breakfast on the brand new terasse while acclimatizing and 2 rooms have balcony! The family is unforgettable, very welcoming and ready to share their culture with you :)",JulieShanti,/Profile/JulieShanti,"Montreal, Canada",50
ladakh,I stayed here in 2015 and 2016 during biking trips to Ladakh. Run by a very friendly and helpful family and situated just off Sankar Road in a quiet and peaceful part of Leh. It's a 10 - 15 minute walk to the market area - great for acclimatisation! They have a variety of rooms (i.e. some with attached bathroom etc) but the large room upstairs at the front has the most amazing views of the stok kangri range. Unfortunately I can't make it this year but next year this is where I'll be staying.,peter h,/Profile/peterh408,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",50
