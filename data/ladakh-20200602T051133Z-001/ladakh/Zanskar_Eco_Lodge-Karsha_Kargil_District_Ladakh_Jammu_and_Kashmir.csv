ladakh,Zanskar valley-the remotest valley in India is a place to fall in love with. Breathtaking landscapes mystic manestories and eversmiling local people make this place a travellers paradise. The district headquarters is located at Padum a small town with vibrant colours. Our stay at Padum was at Zanskar Eco Lodge located  just below Padum monestary. It is a beautiful and cozy place to relax and enjoy and with the hospitality of Mr.Tashi Tundup it's owner and his wife all are sure to experience home like atmosphere. It's a homestay worth every rupee,Ritabrata G,/Profile/133ritabratag,"Kolkata, India",50

ladakh,"Very nice and very clean family-run hotel/B&B. There is a beautiful little garden in front of it and you can fall asleep listen to the voice of the stream descending from its parent mountains. You can have dinner, breakfast and every kind of information and help from the owner.",Alessandro Bianco,/Profile/J7429BUalessandrob,,50
