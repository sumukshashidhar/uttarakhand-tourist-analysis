ladakh,Our Stay at hotel was comfortable. Food was excellent. Wi-Fi is not working properly due connectivity issues. Over all good experience. Said review is about newly renovated rooms. One can choose this hotel as it is near to the Airport. Market is far from the hotel but Taxis are available for local visit.,Harshu,,"Ahmedabad, India",40
ladakh,"Our stay of 6nights at Hotel Royal Palace Leh was very comfortable, great location. Good food, well maintained overall. Hot water 24hrs. Quick laundry service. Wonderful snow clad mountain  view from the rooms Helpful staff, Ali at the reception was very kind and efficient. Highly recommend staying here as the city area could get  crowded. At the same time easy  access to the market. ",kim l,,,40
ladakh,"Worst hotel don't book, very cheap and average food daily same repeated breakfast and dinner. When we approach to hotel staff regarding food they are asking this is management call. Hotel water is major issue. My frind has book this hotel, he told me amount 37k but when I reached hotel owner surprised me cost of 40k very cheat and cheap.

ladakh,"Amazing sets of rooms, this hotel has a friendly and efficient staff. Food and restaurant are functional and whip up decent meals in short time. The compound within the hotel is nice, sunny and great to be surrounded by fruits bearing trees. Staff responsible for cleaning worked with clock work precision. Bathrooms in lower rooms were equipped with geysers ( Deluxe rooms). Runners who participate in Leh Marathon ( September) may find this hotel convenient due to its proximity to the start / finish point ( 500 meters). Leh market is uphill from this hotel and a brisk walk takes about half and hour to get there ( market).",san293,/Profile/san293,"New Delhi, India",40

ladakh,"Royal Palace hotel is a wonderful hotel ! We got a room on the third floor which was excellent in all aspects especially the view. The staff is wonderful and made an effort to give us everything we asked for - from a bottle of water to an extra pillow. We had breakfast included and we found the choices offered to be very good and satisfying. Food is made with effort and the staff is super amazing and helpful.   Zubair and his staff really did their best to accommodate all of our needs. From arranging taxis, trips to Nubra Valley and any question we had regarding the area. Wifi works well and hot water is available all the time. It was really important to us and the hotel didn't let us down.

ladakh,"Beware Traveller's if you are booked or planning to book at this hotel. The front desk staff is very bad and can deny you a room any time, or can charge you triple the rate what they actually sell on. They are robbers in disguise . We had a very bad experience on Arrival. We were booked through booking.com and on Arrival the hotel denied us he room and said we do not accept reservation s from booking.com or any other online portal .We couldn't contact booking.com as the internet services are suspended by the government for most of the time in a year and only postpaid mobiles work. It is also very difficult to connect calls on the postpaid mobile as well. The rooms are average and most of them are old with wooden interiors and dark coloured curtains .

ladakh,"I travelled to Leh on an official trip during second week of August 2016. Though it may not be the best season for tourists but the weather was clear and travelling was very easy.   Hotel Royal palace is a average hotel to stay.  While hotel looks and ambience is good but rooms are average.  The restaurant is good but since buffet was arranged for us we fed up eating same type of food every day.  The hotel is easily accessible as it is very near to main road.   The room cleaning service is pathetic,  they just seem to superficially arrange things so as to look the room is cleaned.   Ventilation may be an issue for the ground floor rooms as opening windows is not a good option since environment is windy and dusty.  Outside lawns and sitting place is good.  Rooms are cozy and",Aravinda K,/Profile/930aravindak,"Bengaluru, India",30

The hotel is very nice with clean and spacious rooms, it is located close to the airport and less than 10minutes walk to Main Bazaar (city center), the restaurant prepares delicious dishes at an affordable price and the staff is kind and helpful. We spent almost a week at Hotel Royal Palace and we rely on them to organize our tour in Ladakh...Zubair, the head of the hotel and the travel agency, is highly experienced and organized our tour down to the smallest details. Our driver, Age, didn't speak English but was very prudent on the rough roads of Ladakh, the camps we slept in Nubra Valley and Pangong lake were very nice and the tour in general was really balanced and arranged really well.

It was very comfortable and clean with helpful staff.

ladakh,We visited Leh during April 2016. We were impressed by the hotel services. The staffs were very helpful and friendly.

This hotel looks very beautiful from their garden, garden is having apple trees and places to sit and relax. They welcomed us very warmly.

Rooms: were very good, neat & clean & staff service was also good....Probably, due to our itinerary, we stayed there on different days (not continuous), we have probably experienced all style + type + variety of rooms...  Ambiance: It was more than expected; they have very good photogenic lawn & seating area;  Food: no need to mention about food. Though, due to geography of town & hilly terrain, people used to serve paneer a lot (Veg + otherwise) :)  Heating system: good but has very restricted timing of 7pm to 10pm....need to improve by management, as visitors tend to feel cold even the temp is good.

ladakh,"Some hotels just make you feel in awe just because of their service, Royal palace Leh is among them for me.  Right from the start till the end ,the hospitality was noteworthy. Thanks Zubair for keeping all our perceptions aside and putting your best foot forward in your hotel.  The rooms are small, but will keep you warm. Lifts are not there but then it is just a 2 storied hotel. Will take some time to adjust but then its worth it.  15 minute uphill walk to the market and thats tough , so i recommend you catch a cab and pay him Rs 20 to reach the market.  Shopping for souvenirs, just head to Moti Market and clearly avoid the Tibetian market and refugee market if you dont want to spend more on them.

ladakh,"We stayed for 4 days in August. The location is the best part of the hotel - very near to the airport, market, hospital & exit point for places of interest - but very quiet and free from traffic. The hotel has two wings - the old one near the lobby and the new one across a neat garden with apricot and apple trees (with fruit!!!). One should try the new wing (better view) and as high as one can climb in Leh without lifts. Avoid hotel food for lunch and dinner - they are pretty bad.

Room is quite clean but if you opened the window, the dust from outside will enter your room.

At first sight we were very much taken by the mostly successful mixture of local craftsmanship and modern architecture--but (as we say in German) the devil is in the details ... .  Although the rear building, where our room # 507 was located, cannot have been more than 2 or 3 years old the plumbing was disastrous:  All the faucets were dripping, the shower stall (quite modernistic, it seemed) was simply pushed into a corner of the room and not sealed against the wall so that the bathroom floor was flooded after the first use.

Friendly staff but be aware of bakshish requests by some of the (non active) supervisors of the porters. Neighbourhood so so.

The rooms are clean and well equipped, although having water in the room would be a nice touch.   The availability of hot water and electric was a bit hit and miss, but I think this is the same for other hotels in Leh as well.  We were disappointed about the lack of internet connection, as this is advertised on their website. The location is about 10 minutes down hill from the market, but it is a good way to test your stamina on the first day at altitude, and there is a hotel car which can run you up there.

I had a room on the fourth floor of the hotel, which offered an un-interrupted view of the snow covered KhardungLa on one side and the ChangLa on the other.
