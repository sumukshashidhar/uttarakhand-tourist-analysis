ladakh,"I would like to thank all the members and staff  of Pangong House who suggested us to stay in a Homestay rather than taking a Camp because the weather conditions in High Altitude are unpredicitable and the temp maintaned in Pangong house was very pleasant. We were surprised after having such  great meals at such an remote place. All the arrangements were above 5 stars. I wish i could have stayed there for few more days, it felt HOME AWAY FROM HOME. I am Surely meeting you guys this year as well.  I have soo much to say about this place but would recommend you to go and experience this once in your life .  @Pangong House People C you all very soon.",teji r,,"Mira Bhayandar, India",50
ladakh,Stayed at pangong hose while visiting pangong lake. It's simple but very clean and very comfortable. The staff is will you over with their service. It's on the lake so location is a great plus. Would definitely recommend it.,Kavitaberi,,,50
ladakh,"This place is like luxury in an otherwise basic tents stay available at Pangong . Well structured, cozy & clean rooms, very humble & hospitable staff, tasty food. The best part is it is close to the lake and you can walk to it whenever you want. Had a very wonderful experience.",Malvika Bedia,,,50
ladakh,"Highly recommend staying at this place. The road there is a bit rough, but totally worth it. The staff there is super friendly. Food is home-cooked and the place is neat and cleanly. Make sure to walk out in the night past 11 pm and look at the sky. The glowing stars in the milky way will just mesmerize you.",K.V.Singh,,,50
ladakh,"We visited Pangong Sarai just a few days ago. The place is as remote as can be. The road difficult to navigate. But all the efforts become worthwhile, when you reach Pangong Sarai. The people here are helpful, kind and look after you like you are family. The food is home cooked. It's basic facilities but the warmth shown by the staff make the stay memorable.",Prachi Ritesh,,"Mumbai, India",50
