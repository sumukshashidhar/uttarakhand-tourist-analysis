ladakh,"We have been 3 nights in the Namra Hotel (there is also a camp behind it). Zanskar is not the region where you find perfect or at least very good hotels. But Namra is acceptable (and hence very good for Zanskar). The room was well furnished and clean. The bath room quite small, no place for anything there. The shower was well working and warm, only the flooding of the complete bath room was unavoidable and annoying. Then the tiles in the bath room got very slippery. The meals, breakfast and dinner, were good, there was a rich choice at the buffet. The staff was very friendly and helped whenever you asked. So my overall assessment of Namra Hotel is postive.",Review314159,/Profile/Review314159,"Karlsruhe, Germany",40
ladakh,"We stayed at the Hotel, which also has this camp ground, the place is an oases surrounded by the natural beauty of the Himalayas, it was very clean, the bed was soft which was a nice change from Firm to Hard beds which we had been encountering, the room was nicely appointed, there is a very nice out door area that we ate Dinner at, the food was good but not the best we had encountered while in India, the staff are friendly and easy to deal with. There is WiFi which is often a rare find while in the Himalayas, so great chance to catch up. There is a Traditional Kitchen, which we were treated to having our group served a Traditional Breakfast, great to learn some of the local culture and history so I recommend it if you get the chance.",David L,/Profile/D6816KGdavidl,,50
ladakh,"Beautiful Hotel with warmth service from the owner family and also the staff. We stay in new room which is very very nice, the interior is the best, clean, cozy, modern. I have prefect view from room window, it just peaceful place. We eat dinner at the hotel, which is veggie grown by the hotel. Definitely a must stay hotel if you are in Tingmosgang area. They have hotel rooms and also camp area. in the morning we are very happy to have breakfast together with the owner and the owner grandfather with Ladahki style and traditional bread. It was pleasant to stay there.",Yeniwati T,/Profile/yeniwatit2018,"Tangerang, Indonesia",50
ladakh,Enjoyed our stay at said campsite. Good location. Good food. Co operative staff. Try to stay in hotel rooms instead of tents. Tent quality is not up to the mark. Wi Fi facility was poor. Camp fire facility is available but their charges are very high.,Harshu,/Profile/harshhrz,"Ahmedabad, India",40
ladakh,"Namra hotel is one of the most peaceful place, excellent hospitality, amidst serenity and quietness. The warmth of the Namra family made me stay here multiple times. I was touched by Mr. Namra's welcoming words to say that ""this is your summer home and feel at home"" and indeed it was my home. Great hospitality, natural gardens, artistically setup with traditional Ladakhi atmosphere, organic food and personal touch made me return to this place multiple times.  if you are a photography enthusiast, then this is the one of the best places for Star trails and time lapses to capture those stunning moments.  This place is strategically located and proximity to many interesting historic and spiritual places make Namra Hotels one of the most sought out places to stay in the valley.

ladakh,"we arrived in Leh at 7 am and instead of staying in Leh we proceeded directly from airport to Tingmosgang, Namra hotel which is about 2 hrs drive. There are 2 types, rooms and camp/tents, depending on your  budget you can book any. Prior booking is advisable during high season. It is beautifully located hotel and the owner Mr. Punchock is very helpful in planning your further trip. Afternoon visit Maitrey temple and monastery. 2nd day : get up early, walk around the village and you have multiple options : 1- full day trekking  2- visit to dah hanu village : a must do activity. The journey along the indus river beside lower himalayan range is so beautiful with its different landscapes you feel like just sitting and watching the mother nature. you will get all the information",suresh s,/Profile/525sureshs,"Mysore, Karnataka, India",50
ladakh,"Select this property if you want Peaceful mind and relaxation after hectic year long work. Hotel Rooms are decent. You wont be getting Wifi Here in good strength, that is the only drawback. Food is great.",KUPPUMANIKANDAN,/Profile/KUPPUMANIKANDAN,,40
ladakh,The camp was so much good. Amazing location of camp. Sleep quality was good. Jain food was also provided in this remote camp. Food taste was excellent. Tent location excellent. The staff was also co-operative.,Dhaval Shah,/Profile/Dhaval78,"Ahmedabad, India",50
ladakh,"We were a team of 30, and we spent one night at Namra Camp. Actually, it is not spent, it went on so smoothly that even today it is wondering experience how one night stay passed like a flash. No stress at all being at a new place in the nature's lap.  Thanks to the hotel management and staff.  The most fascinating thing for me was book corner and a small travel up to the river from hotel's backyard. Food and ambience was excellent so did the attention paid and hospitality.  Nobody will have word of disagreement regarding that who were with me.  Visit it and enjoy it.  Thanks Namra Camp.",kc_drajay,/Profile/kc_drajay,"Jaysingpur, India",50
ladakh,"We accidentally ended up in Namra near Alchi and was one of our best stays in Leh trip. We had visited very early in the season and the hotel was undergoing renovation and the Tents were still not up in the camp. The apricot blossom, the picturesque monastery, snow clad peaks and the beautiful old village made a perfect setting. The best part were the owners who were so kind to invite us for the dinner in their own kitchen and had food with us. We had great chat about Leh, local culture etc. They served us local food like Ladakhi saag, Ladakhi bread, local jam. The rooms are decent but do not have balcony. Next time, will surely try the Tents.",ketan_fans,/Profile/ketan_fans,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"We stayed at Namra camp during our travel from Leh to Srinagar. The camp is located in a very small secluded village, quite in inskirts from the highway with very small village establishments, green vegetation around and freshness all over. Last minute change in our booking dint get us to stay in the rooms, so we had to stay in the tents. But was fully satisfying. The tents are downhill from the rooms and next to a flowing water stream. The flowing water sound was very soothing. Also the tents were pitched around green apple and apricot trees around. The tents area is not too big, but the sit outs under the trees and morning tea sitting and unwinding there was an experience.  The tent toilets are good, with all basic amenities and hot water. Overall clean property. Nice",Dhruv6373,/Profile/Dhruv6373,"Ahmedabad, India",40
ladakh,"You can do everything there and around Tingmosgang: hiking, trekking, visiting monasteries and villages ... and relax.  The hospitality of this Family Guest House is exceptional. The food is better than somewhere in Leh ... Just go and try yourself!",Werner N,/Profile/12WernerN,"Biel, Switzerland",50
ladakh,"We were a group of 3 friends, staying on triple occupancy basis in a tent. The hotel has rooms as well. The tent was very spacious, neat and clean. The bathroom was also very nice. Hot water was provided when required. Food was ok. Staff was very helpful. Peaceful, tarnquil surroundings. Very often frequented by foreigners. The place is famous for trekking.",MunnaT,/Profile/MunnaT,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",40
ladakh,"We travelled from Srinagar to Temisgam in a single day, which was very hectic (started at 5:30am and reached 8:30pm) so the least we were expecting a good night's sleep and guess what? we got more that what we had expected.  Very nice hotel, clean rooms, all required amenities in place and most of all a very good hotel staff. View: We reached at night so when we stepped out of car it was a feeling like we were in galaxy of stars and in morning we were in the laps of mountains. There are rooms and tents also both are the best you will find in ladakh. not much to do in the village, there is a monestry and some hiking places which are arranged by the hotel staff. Remote Ladakh at its best.",Nirav309,/Profile/Nirav309,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"we were group of 7 people 6 adult + 1 child, awesome place to stay very good hospitality, Mr. Namra has well maintained the place. we visited in month of may.Good food and hygiene is well maintained.  Proper supply of hot water. Room service was nice. and people were very homely. they served ladakhi bread and apricot jam really tasty.",hikapoors,/Profile/hikapoors,"Delhi, Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"Room & Amenities: This place is a little gem. The setting is rural Ladakh, but the hotel does provide all modern amenities. Clean rooms and toilets. Nice beds. Great staff and a great little tea-room. The food is all vegetarian. I asked the staff if they made non vegetarian on request and they do. The last time they had meat was when a deer had lost her footing and on the mountain side and crashed into the valley. The vegetarian food was quite spicy, but it had great variety. The staff is always trying to get you to sample true Ladakhi fare. We tried out their local bread and it was delicious.   Things to do:  Explore rural Ladakh. Theres a monastery too and a Vipassana center. In my view a great place to catch up on some reading/introspection/idling around.",Chandanmohanty,/Profile/Chandanmohanty,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Nice hotel with en suite double rooms (14) and en suite double tents (16) in the grounds down to the river.  Our room had a balcony with a lovely view to the palace on the hill.  The staff were very good, the restaurant is nice and the food pretty good.    The hot water wasn't very hot.  No TV, if that worries you, and electricity only in the evenings.  Beautifully set beneath the palace and amongst small farming community – very idyllic rural Ladakh.",Alistair C,/Profile/MillOaks,"Porlock, United Kingdom",40
ladakh,I wonder how many people know about small & beautiful hamlets like Tingmosgang in Ladhak!!. We were lucky to discover this exquisite village by chance. I strongly recommend all those who wish to travel to Leh in the near future to spend a couple of nights at Hotel & camp Namra. The host Mr. Funshuk Namra is a genuine gentleman and his place is divine. The camp site is nestled in the orchards of green apple and apricot trees and you are free to pluck and eat to your hearts desire. Little drive from Namra is a unique village which has interlocking houses. You can go from one house to another through tunnels within the village. One has to see to understand what I mean.,Tapan-Patel,/Profile/Tapan-Patel,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,Namra Camp is located 15kms after Lamayuru....!! You can have option to leave in hotel i.e. constructed rooms and Swiss Camp (tents). The place is v.beautiful and was the best property of our Ladakh Trip. The hospitality in Ladakh is heart touching. The tents in this property has apple and walnut plantation. I think the best time is July-Aug. The quality of tent is excellent and well maintained place. I would like to visit once again.,ashaym,/Profile/ashaym,"Mumbai, India",50
