ladakh,"This guest house is just far enough from the market to be peaceful, but close enough for an easy walk. They only have about 6 rooms or so, all neat and clean and well maintained. The owner, Chozang, is a total delight. They have a few tables in the lobby and also outside where you can get tea and maybe some snacks, though I just had a nimbu pani.",Peregrineri,/Profile/Peregrineri,"New Delhi, India",50
