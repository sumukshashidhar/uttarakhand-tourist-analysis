ladakh,"We did an overnight stay at Camp Redstart as part of our Pangong trip. The camp is located just minutes walk (probably 3-4 mins) from the lake.  The camps are really well made with clean washrooms. The food was quite good. The best part was the camp manager who took really good care of us and checked on us often as my husband had fallen sick - he made sure to get us warm vessels, checked oxygen levels (i was surprised he knew what all to do) and was super helpful.  Best camp in the area.",Ayushi Chandra,/Profile/AyushiChandra,,50
ladakh,"Camp Redstart is located a beautiful location - 100 m away from the Pangong lake and since it was on a height, it had a beautiful view just outside our tents.  We stayed a night as we wanted to camp at the lake. Though we could not get any sleep since it was cold and low oxygen, but the camp manager made sure that we were well taken care of. He had oxymeter to check oxygen levels and was constantly checking on me as I fell in.  The food was also quite good with lot of options. The tents were quite nice and spacious with clean toilet area.",SerendipityIndia,/Profile/SerendipityIndia,"New Delhi, India",50

Food at breakfast and dinner was buffet and good even at this remote location. This location is very cold and tents and bedding provided sufficient warmth to sleep comfortably. Only other thing was caretaker had school warden type speaking tone.,sonal shirwant,/Profile/sonal1687,,40

ladakh,Stay here was worst of our 10 day leh trip. There is no service attitude at all here and price charged here is exorbitant as compared to what you can get on walk in at any one of the camps. This camp is quite far from the lake and it's tad bit of walk down from here to lake front. Bad cooks here - don't even know how to make maggi (was served uncooked even after  asking to do twice). Skip this one for sure.,Anirudh S,/Profile/777anirudhs,"Mumbai, India",10

Naturally we were expecting a reasonably good camp near the lake that caters to a comfortable stay, hot water and good food.

ladakh,Camp redstart is the best accomodation provided at Pangong lake. It is located at a height from the lake so it offers great views as well as a comfortable stay. The tents are basic but large and clean. Bathroom is clean too. They provide battery lantern as power is there only from 7pm-10pm that too on generator. The staff is very friendly and food offered for dinner and breakfast is the best. Limited choice but very tasty. Parking and driver's accomodation facility is there.

Hot water is provided for one hour in the morning and electricity for 4 hours in the night.

It was very windy and very very cold when we got there.  The tent looked quite warm and was very spacious, the bed seemed very comfy too. We were immediately served with hot tea and biscuits in the large Dining Hall.

As inherent in all our Tours, we are very particular about the type of experience we provide to our tour members. So after much research and pondering on the web we decided to go with Redstart Camp for our Stay at Lake Panong Tso. Now my experience follows. Pros: > The staff was helpful and responsive, you can rely on them completely  Cons:  > The location even though near to the lake is a steep climb of around half a kilometer from the banks of the lake > Most of the camps have a slightly interrupted view of the lake, which gets slightly covered by the tips of the tents below them. This is however only an issue if you are sitting. > The food sucked, in comparison to all the other camps",Rajat M,/Profile/rajatm412,,30
ladakh,We stayed at Camp Redstart and the tents are super nice and comfortable with attached bathrooms with flushes :)   I think what is really amazing about this place is the amazing staff. Namgyal who is the brother of the owner was there when we stayed the night and he was a delight. We had one of our friend's birthday eve and at midnight wanted to celebrate with something. The staff cooked a pancake and layered it with Nutella as a makeshift cake!   The views of the lake are amazing from the tent and the walk to the lake is very short and nice. We also ended up walking from our tents to the point where the lake has a stretched out strip of sand.

ladakh,Camp redstart is located near the shores of the Pangong lake. On the positive side the tents are good- very clean and with attached toilets which is a blessing especially if you have cold weather. Breakfast and other meals were decent considering the remoteness of the place. On the negative side multiple ugly campsites have sprung up between the Camp redstart and the lake. The Spangnik area has got so cluttered it really destroys the pristine image of Pangong.,SDhume,/Profile/SDhume,"Thane, India",30

The food was basic but fresh and well prepared. I have tasted the best onion pakodas here for snacks.

We had to wait and argue for 2 hours to get all 5 tents that we had booked for. All this happened because there's barely any network in Pangong area and all their bookings are managed through Leh.

ladakh,"Camp Redstart @ Pangong Tso is a typical case of what you see is what you don’t get. Most acco at Pangong is basic, but Redstart can certainly do better. The tents are weather proof, no complaints on that. The staff seems to be de-motivated completely. One gets a feeling that we are a disturbance to them. For 3 people, we were given half a bucket of warm water, they said that is what they give per tent ! Food is basic, but tolerable.

The tents were nice and clean and the location was good, we had a view of Spangmik and the lake. The lake shore was about 5 minutes walk. The camp staff was helpful and the food was good.  Compared to other camps in the area, Camp Redstart is a good choice if you are looking for some lovely quaint time in the valley.

For the only reason that you can wake up early in   the morning and see the lake transform into different hues of Blue and Turquoise. That is one stunning sight that   should not be missed in ones lifetime.  We woke up at 5.00 AM to see the pale gray of Lake Pangong. As the sun rose, the lake started to turn blue. A pale   blue at first and then a bright Turquoise. We then jumped into the freezing cold water. It was unbelievably cold at   first but then it became bearable.
