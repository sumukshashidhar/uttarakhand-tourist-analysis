ladakh,"The property is in Hunder, around 2 kms from the sand dunes of Hunder.  This is a nice spacious property with large rooms. The rooms on the 1st floor also have balconies. The rooms have TV with cable connection and hot water is available in the bathroom.  The property has an excellent and large farm with apple-laden trees, an apricot tree and variety of vegetables like cauliflower, cabbage, onions, carrots, maize etc. which are used to prepare dinner. The dinner provides very good vegetarian food, though it is limited in variety. The owner of the property is very nice and affable. The manager, Ashwani is an extremely helpful and resourceful manager, a great asset to the property.    A few minor negatives: Bedsheets and pillow covers were not very clean, however, Ashwani got them",Amit Srivastava,,"Mumbai, India",50

ladakh,We had a lovely room that was clean and comfortable. Really comfy bed! They have a nice shower with 24 hour hot water. ( much needed after time in Turtuk). The balcony is the best part with views of the garden and mountains. The family is nice. We got stranded in Turtuk for an extra day and they so kindly shifted our booking without any penalty. The father drove us to transportation in the morning free of charge too. Lovely place in Hunter! About 2.5 ish km walk to the dunes but everywhere is a walk to the dunes. You can eat dinner and breakfast at the house or about 10-15 mins away there is a budget restaurant too.,Tammy2124,,"Vancouver, Canada",40
