ladakh,We traveled to Leh in June 2016 and it was a 5 nights trip to Ladakh region. First two nights we stayed in Labuddha which is a decent hotel located near Shanti Stupa. Hotel is a sort of small budget hotel of 12 rooms and is well managed. The room offered to us was adjacent to the common terrace area and near to the stairs leading to the restaurant and reception. We liked the hotel as it was very pocket friendly and with decent staffs.,VibhorTulsyan,/Profile/VibhorTulsyan,"Jaipur, India",40
ladakh,"Hospitality, amenities, location, and food are all excellent. Great new hotel- the staff is courteous and the owner is a gentleman. They go out of their way to make your stay special. This hotel is so much more than what they charge for.  Seriously the best hospitality me and my buddies experienced throughout our trip to India from the US.",DBasu92,/Profile/DBasu92,"Dallas, Texas",50
ladakh,"Stayed at La Budhha for 2 nights during my Ladakh tour. This new hotel is good, specially for people who want to stay away from the hustle and bustle of market. Shanti Stupa, one of the attractions in Leh, is visible from this hotel.  Food was quite good. Chicken preparation was awesome. Enjoyed sitting on the terrace.",Subodh,/Profile/subodhsamyak,"New Delhi, India",50
