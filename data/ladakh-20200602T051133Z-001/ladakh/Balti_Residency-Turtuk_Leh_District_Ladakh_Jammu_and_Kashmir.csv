ladakh,"We had to return back to Turtuk due to a landslide on our way back to Hundor. Stayed at Turtuk for a night. The owner was very hospitable and efficient. The food cooked was very tasty. They have their own vegetable garden, which makes the food fresh and organic.  There are also apricot trees from which you can pick the fruits and eat. The owner's son plucked a full basket of apricots for us in the morning. Really enjoyed the stay.",Vishwanath R,/Profile/603vishwanathr,,50
ladakh,We have visited Turtuk in the month of June 2018. It is very small village near POK.Village is like all other INDIAN villages.since 2009 Govt has issuing permits to go to Turtuk hence staying options are very less in the village. The first Impression was will not get basic comfort but we were wrong and surprised by the location and the rooms. One Imp thing need to keep in mind that NO VEHICLE can reach near the Hotel. Tourist has to carry his/her luggage to the hotel by it's own.It is quite big task.Room are not much big but comfortable. There is common wash room at ground fl. as well as each room is having wash rooms inside.Food is good and service is excellent. Electricity is between 7.30 pm to 11 pm. So pls carry powerful torch with you.   Overall it's very good experience.,shaileshu10,/Profile/shaileshu10,"Dombivli, India",40
