ladakh,"I was here for 4 nights in July 2019 and I must say it was a delightful experience at Snowland hotel. It offers decent rooms, cleanliness, good food and good view too. More importantly very helpful staff. This hotel is also near to main Market, 10 mins walk",rmnene,/Profile/rmnene,"Pune, India",50
ladakh,It's a well maintained & clean hotel. They organise a cultural event for guests (of group bookings) on check in which is worth a watch. The food was superb and three meals are included with your booking. Hope you continue to maintain the quality standards.,Gunjan_21,/Profile/Gunjan_21,,40

ladakh,Comfortable warm rooms. Bathroom was clean but hot water was on a restricted basis. Internet slow but free wifi. Restaurant average quality but the staff were very friendly and made us feel welcome for the days we stayed here.,RobyNZ56,/Profile/RobyNZ56,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",40
ladakh,"excellent views, service, cleanliness, food & people !!! The best in Leh. The owners stay there so thats why they can look into smaller details and are involved in everything. They are wonderful people and the service, food everything is just excellent. Stayed here in 2010 and again in 2016, their standards have gone up and have become even better.",Rajivkm,/Profile/Rajivkm,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Snowland is nice n cozy hotel with good lawn n comfortable rooms Hotel is bit understaff with fix timings for hot water breakfast lunch n dinner which is big drawback with people comi from metropolis who r following fix routine life n want to breakfree from the clock  But must mention Sunil Who manages the show is courteous n caretaking The staff is off duty after 11 in night  Food is ok ok with fixed menu for breakfast not so Gr8 ,people giving food as their main priority for stay should avoid this hotel So in all the hotel is decent stay bit overprice One can just opt for stay n have food in market which have pretty good options around",Pranav,/Profile/pranav81177,"Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,"Hotel Snowland is about an 8-10 minutes drive from the Leh airport and close to the main market. It is inside a not-so- broad lane and hence if you are traveling in an SUV, it would have to park on the main road. The walk from the main road through the lane to the hotel is not more than a minute.   Once inside the hotel compound, the first instant feel is that of warmth and coziness. The small lawn and vibrant colours of the garden flowers are bound to attract your attention. The hotel manager is a very efficient man who controls the hotel with a smile on his face. The inside decor is richly done in tradition Ladakhi style.  The rooms are pretty big and you get an excellent view of the distant mountains from the balcony and the windows. The toilet is clean and spacious, with hot",anidg77,/Profile/anidg77,"Kolkata, India",50
ladakh,Awesome place to live. Nice rooms Good Food Polite staff. Very nice Garden and very good food.  Locations is also very good.   Though you can not compare it with 3or 5 star hotels but Its worth a money. Overall Nice experience,RahulBarveIndia,/Profile/RahulBarveIndia,"Pune, India",40
ladakh,"Possible the cleanest place we have ever stayed.The garden watered and tidied early every morning, fences wiped down. The garden is very pleasant to sit in.  Comfortable rooms, we liked our balcony, friendly helpful staff, free wifi, great food. Fresh veg picked from the immaculate garden. You must try the Marsala Omelette, delicious.",Pat P,/Profile/Trekker1948,"Kirkby in Furness, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"Booked a triple room with family. Rooms are spacious with hot water facility available throughout the day. Heater is available at an additional price of Rs.250 per day. Room is equipped with basic amenities only. There is no provision of an electric kettle. Rooms are cozy and clean. Food was good but have to order 2 hours in advance. They arrange for buffet depending upon the number of people staying at that point of time. In all, a budget hotel. Would like to try a different place on my next visit!",Manish Deo,/Profile/deomanish,"Navi Mumbai, India",30

ladakh,"Stayed at this place one year back and overall the property is decent but the attitude of the staff is very negative. The problem is that most of the staff (including the manager) are not Ladakhis but from Himachal. They are in Ladakh to earn money and don't care what the tourists think. They tried to fudge my hotel bill and when I challenged them, the manager started to shout and even threatened me. It was crazy. The issue was highlighted to the owner of the property; unfortunately he just said such things happen and went off, did not even care to apologize.",rishib80,/Profile/rishib80,"Noida, India",30
ladakh,"I stayed here whilst acclimatising to the altitude before a trek. The hotel is clean & comfortable, the rooms cover all your needs and are in good condition. The staff are friendly and more than willing to help. The food is well cooked and there is plenty of it. Location wise, the hotel is situated just outside the centre of Leh (about 2 minutes walk) and so is ideal for shopping or generally exploring the town but is far enough away to avoid light pollution as there is an accessible rooftop to the hotel which was excellent for stargazing at night.

ladakh,"I stayed in the Snowland as part of a contingent of Scouts from West Yorkshire prior to a trecking expedition. We took over the whole of the hotel, with the owners and staff being very patient and carring, nothing was too much trouble for them. The food was wholesome and I would of enjoyed it more if I had not been suffering from the altitude, but the rest of the contingent seemed to enjoy it. The rooms were clean and bathrooms adequate. I had to return early with one of the contingent who was unwell to Leh and luckily we were able to have rooms back at the Snowland. They agian looked after us well but we were plaugued by power cuts during the day in Leh.  Overall a very nice hotel with good owners and staff",shelagh p,/Profile/shelaghp14,"Huddersfield, United Kingdom",40
ladakh,"I reached Hotel SnowLand on 30th June as a part of the Yatra group tour.  Good things first- The Hotel is close to the market + The view is great if you you are in Room number 106 to Room number 108. For all the other rooms you majorly see the wall of the hotel.  Now the bad things: 1) Ladakhis are lovely people as discovered when interacting with them. The worst, most sluggish and rudest are working in Snow Land. The service is extremely poor with a normal service time of 20-25 mins even for tea. 2) They cheated me on my Hotel bill and cherged things which I didnt consume. When I contested, the employees got rude and started shouting at me and my wife without provocation. 3) Please avoid food at the Hotel. Breakfast has only milk, cornflakes and omlettes. Lunch is heated and",Rahul M,/Profile/133rahulm,"Mumbai, India",10
ladakh,"The place is nestled between  bylanes and therefore quiet.  Food is good, quite like home-cooked.  We are vegetarians so I can only comment about the vegetarian fare.  The amenities are very basic.  There is no regular hot water supply, there are no geysers in the bath.  The hot water supply is restricted to 2 hours morning and 2 hours in the evening.  In that cold weather, who is having bath at 6am in the morning Mr Manager? and it is a tourist destination.  I am on a holiday, if you have forgotten.  No basics such as toilet paper or any other toiletries.  So go prepared.  The hotel is damp most of the day, although this is not the case in other places in Leh.  We were given this place through yatra group tour so I cannot say whether the tariffs are value for money.",Askfatty,/Profile/Askfatty,"Bengaluru, India",10
ladakh,"We stayed two nights here. The ground has a nice garden and there is a cool sitting area on the second floor.  It is relatively easy to walk to town center. The food was alright. But the room, the bed, the bathroom, the linens, the towels were not as good or felt as clean as the another hotel that we stayed in Leh (see my later post).  The tv didn't work.  There wasn't much hot water for shower. We ended up storing the hot water in the big bucket first and used that to bathe. Make sure you bring your own toilet paper, soap, and shampoo,etc.  Actually, to my surprise, this was the only place that we stayed that did not provide toliet paper and soap!",Becky0222,/Profile/Becky0222,"Houston, Texas",30
ladakh,"Hotel Snowland was our base for a July trekking holiday in the Markha Valley.  The first thing you notice is a wonderful grass courtyard surrounded by vegetable and flower gardens.  An excellent spot for morning or afternoon tea.  We had a great view of the mountains from our room, which was basic, but a good size.  I do have to say that the beds are the worst I have encountered at any hotel, anywhere in the world.  The food on the other hand was wonderful and the staff were very helpful and accommodating - even storing some of our unneeded gear during the trek.  Overall Snowland is a great spot, walking distance to the commercial area, and quiet at night for well needed rest at altitude.",Rod J,/Profile/Trekking48,"Toronto, Canada",40
