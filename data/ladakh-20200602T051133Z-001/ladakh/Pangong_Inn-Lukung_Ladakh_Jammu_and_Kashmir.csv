ladakh,We stayed in this property for 2 nights while the most leave Pangong after 1 night. And we felt that we took the right decision. Awesome view from the wooden cottage. Situated where the lake begins. Unobstructed view right through the window lying on bed. So we could enjoy all changing colors of the lake from dawn to dusk. The centre of the lake (of course Indian side) is half an hour walking distance. However as the property is situated just beside the lake one can enjoy from there if he has no fascination about the centre. Even in such a solitary place breakfast and dinner option is plenty. Above all the owner and his two sons were so caring that we felt at home. They will have running hot water soon. We got hot water in bucket even at 6a.m. And at night they gave us,Bipasha N,/Profile/rimanee,,40

Management continues to take booking directly and fooling the guests. I was surprised to see the condition of the rooms on arrival , and once you reach pangong late , you cant go back .

Mr. Amarinder Singh very thoughtfully preponed our booking by one day as we wanted to return to Leh as quickly as possible.

ladakh,"It is a hotel located just as you enter the Pangong lake area. We were told not to expect great things in Pangong and the advice is correct. Half of the rooms are not good and choose the rooms near the dining hall which are better. You do not get any telephone or internet in this remote area. There is a very good view of the lake and frankly, you come here to see and absorb the nature and its beauty. Do not expect even 2-star facilities. The food is limited and purely veg stuff but is of good quality. Nobar and no alcohol. Electricity is patchy and at night it becomes so dark that you can not see your own finger in front of your face. If you open the curtains there is similar darkness outside.

I stayed at lake view hotel in tsomoriri which is in even higher altitude than pangong but the overall room and service was worth the money that I paid and it was cheaper than pangong inn.

I paid Rs 6500 for one night which I feel is purely wastage of money. The room should not cost more than Rs 1000. The food provided in dinner and breakfast was not up to the mark.

The food was excellent - I was in awe of how they got their supplies from the city (Leh) and cater a variety of food to all of the guests there.   As an aside (and this has nothing to do with the hotel review): It was also a little disappointing to see people staying at the hotel taking food that they dont plan on eating just because it",Vinay N,/Profile/120vinayn,"Chennai, India",40

The family was fully involved in serving customers since the staff had apparently left. Good view of the lake from the dining area. 2 minutes from the lake.

ladakh,"The Pangong Inn on the banks on Pangong Tso (Lake Pangong) is an urban tourists dream come true. It is NOT a tented accommodation but a series of  PROPER rooms with attached baths that have flushable western-style toilets. Solar heaters provide hot water. Adequate electricity supply to charge cameras etc., which is a blessing as batteries run down in no time at all. Warm quilts and a hot water bottle to boot. Cosy. The nearby dining room with its glasswalls shuts out the bone chilling breeze but allows full view of the Lake with its ever-changing colour.  Brown-headed gulls and Horned larks keep you company and the colourful prayer flags fluttering give an indication about how precious this shelter is.

The Inn is practically on the lake, and is a <2mins walk from the edge of the lake! The staff is also very friendly and gave us warm tea at 5am before we left, despite us asking them not to take the trouble at such wee hours of the morning. The rooms are warm, and beds comfy. Loved the place; if I ever went back to Pangong, I'd stay here.",Pradeep R,/Profile/PradeepR_12,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",50

The rooms are basic yet cosy and have a proper tiled bathroom, WC and wash basin with running hot water. These can be considered five-star amenities at that place. One has to stay just for the night. Sleep quality may be affected, not because of the furnishings but because of the high-altitude. The food in the restaurants adjacent to the hotel is better than what it provides in the common dining room.",Niloy_12,/Profile/Niloy_12,"New Delhi, India",40

ladakh,"Pangong is a matter of one night stay. Some people don't even stay overnight but I suggest, after travelling for 5-6 hours from Leh to Pangong, one must stay at least one night here. Though there are a couple of options for accommodation in Pangong, it is better to book prior to arrival. All the hotels/resorts/inns/homestays are on one side of the lake, which is around 7 kms in length.   My husband & I travelled last April & it is that month of the year when not a lot of options are available as far as accommodation is concerned. The place is still frozen & not in its true from. But the Pangong lake is such a marvel that whether is it frozen or free, it is a spectacle!   The Pangong Inn was one of the only options available in April so we took it. It was reasonably priced & was",monica j,/Profile/realmonu,mumbai,30

The pangong inn cafe had nice food. The view from the hotel at all times of the day was amazing. The staff is courteous and helpful.

ladakh,"I really dont know what to say about this particular hotel. They have so much of potential and should they actually turn them into reality, they might actually build a star-category hotel at the shore of the Pangong Tso.  We had a delux room with an extra cot that the hotel authorities had no idea about. They actually were unprepared when we arrived and they welcomed us with a blank face. Then they decided to give us room no. 4 which was pretty decent but they didnt have any extra cot. Then we realized that they had no power facilities till the evening. In the evening, the power came after much coercing the staff. The power was however limited till 10 at night which we had no idea about. They did provide us with a shoddy electric room heater which turned off after 10 at night.",Avishek D,/Profile/erazerbubun100,"Bridgeport, Connecticut",20

The rooms are adequate (we had a ‚Äòdeluxe‚Äô) but no thought has been given to them ‚Äì just to give one example, there‚Äôs no mirror in the bathroom, making shaving more difficult. The beds are not very comfortable, either. The hotel is right by Pangong Lake, but the view is marred by the tacky tent-shops directly in front of the hotel. As for the food (you eat here because there isn‚Äôt really much choice), it was grim: dhal and rice for lunch; the same dhal and rice with vegetables for dinner; then half the night on the toilet.

ladakh,"This small establishment is nice. And overlooking the Pangong lake, the view is simply wonderful(can't describe the lake in words). In such a remote place, making rooms, getting them functional with lights, hot water, and a small restaurant is truly commendable. Food is very basic but ok(seeing the conditions of the place), rooms clean, proper bathroom with hot water in the daytime, staff is helpful and tries their best to make customers comfortable. But what put me off was the extreamly differential pricing with the customers. Me, my wife and a friend visited pangong lake on 30th of sep 2012.
