ladakh,Our tents were very clean and the view from our tents was unobstructed. The flooring inside tents is carpeted but the bedding as well as flooring and bathrooms were spick and span.  Very spacious tent and comfortable double  bed. They had two small sofas inside the tents. A separate sitting area overlooking the Pangong river is also inclusive as a part of  the tent . Food  served in this camp was veg but tasty. Electricity available from 7pm-11pm. No heaters in the tents but the blankets keep you warm enough provided you wear thermals .  There are fast food restaurants on the lower area which serve non veg as well incase you miss on non veg food . ,akshada78,/Profile/akshada78,"Panjim, India",50

It was amazing to see all facilities in a Tent & we enjoyed our Stay very much, very warm & Comfortable. Also in night due to cold they provided us hot water bottles that one can keep under the blanket to feel very Cozy. Overwhelmed!!",RENU AGARWAL,/Profile/nsa9563,,40

ladakh,only because of 3Idiots shooting it is highlighted.. The hype around the lake is making people greedy and wicked. Not advisable to spend night in this camp. also stinky quilts. Service of the camps' staffs is not up to the mark.,sonu,/Profile/sonugudul,,30
ladakh,"We stayed here for one night during our visit to Pangong Lake. We chose lower level of camp which offered beautiful panoramic view of lake. Our stay was extremely comfortable, supported by fabulous staff. It rained the night we stayed, and we were aptly provided with extra warm linen without any hassle. Nicely maintained property. Value for money with decent camping standards. Highly recommended.",M Explorer,/Profile/mansun1701,"Dar es Salaam, Tanzania",40
ladakh,"They have two levels of tents. The lower levels provide an un-obstructed view of the lake. The power supply is only between 19:30 to 23:00 hrs. and the hot water supply is available from 07:00 hrs in the morning. Considering its very remote location, the facilities provided are excellent. The tents were neat and clean. The staff was very courteous and helpful. If you want to stay a little walking distance away from the lake and enjoy the view of the lake Tso camp is one of the best options for the price charged.",Aarthik Kanal,/Profile/aarthikkanal,"Mumbai, India",40
