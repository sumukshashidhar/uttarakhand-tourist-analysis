ladakh,We took about 5 hours travel from leh to this resort at Nubra's Valley. We were so disappointing to see this horible resort. Bed and blanket were not washed. Toilet was so pathetic. Thank god we only stay for a nite. We recommend you all not to ever book this resort.,gankam,/Profile/gankam,Bangalore,10
ladakh,"The place lives up to its name as it is as luxurious as a camp stay can get. Clean tents, attached restroom with hot water facility, TV and dish connection. The food served was delicious and most welcome after a hectic day travel. Service was excellent.",Amrit_Rabi,/Profile/Amrit_Rabi,"Pune, India",50
ladakh,"Our driver recommended K2 and we spent a lovely night here. The tents are well set up with attached bathrooms, power sockets to charge phones and TVs. The location is peaceful and beautiful, looking up at the mountains and dotted with trees and wild herbs. We had dinner included in our tariff which was delicious and served exactly when suited us. Recommended option for a Nubra stay.",Catherine P,/Profile/catherinep307,"London, United Kingdom",40
ladakh,"We stayed at K2 when we visited Nubra valley. It was a long drive from Leh, bad roads made it even more tiring. We reached K2 in the afternoon. This place is a cluster of camps/ tents with attached bath and basic amenities. The tents were airtight with cemented floors, making them very comfortable in the night. In the middle of desert surrounded by dry but scenic himalayas, this place was once in a lifetime experience. Temperature around noon was quite warm, but no comfort of fans or air conditioners. Nights on the contrary were chilling cold.  Power supply is an issue here. I believe that's the case with all staying options at Nubra. Electricity supply is available from 6:00 pm till around 11:00 pm. with frequent power cuts supplemented by power back up. That means you need to",Arnab19,/Profile/Arnab19,"Mumbai, India",30
