ladakh,"Nimmu House offers cuisine created with a spirit of generosity and profound hospitality.  The home holds a rare Himalayan charm in the rooms, the attention to detail, and the most caring staff members. My great surprise came in the range, quality, and rare find of the cuisine!  Maya brings her life gift to her preparations, across a range of palettes and global offerings.  Nimmu House makes a wonderful base to explore the region, or share in a relaxing holiday space. It defines one of those life destinations!  Thank you so much to all!",Jennifer Natalie,/Profile/jennifernatalie,,50
ladakh,"Stayed for 3 nights in the house itself. Room was really comfortable. The house itself is beautiful. Food was good. Really enjoyed talking with Adam whilst sat in the beautiful garden. He was really great to talk to with lots of helpful suggestions.  It’s a quiet and relaxing house, and as it’s lower than Leh, was much easier and more comfortable. I can understand why people go straight there rather than Leh. It was lovely to walk up to the village in the morning and evening and see a bit of local life. People are really friendly and would stop and chat. Good base to visit surrounding area. Would love to return. Sat under an apple tree reading, looking at beautiful flowers and enjoying the peace, was a definite highlight of the trip to Ladakh.",becklambert,/Profile/becklambert,Brighton,50
ladakh,"The Nimmu House in Ladakh, some 30 kms away from Leh, is a place worth visiting by itself. It's an old house that used to belong to the King of Ladakh, and it was restored a few years ago, now serving as a guest house but keeping the tradition of the place intact. There are only five rooms in the house itself, and some six or seven well-appointed fixed tents in the gardens surrounding the main house. The food, vegetarian, is absolutely delicious and breakfast in the open-air patio is also excellent. The hosts, Fabrice and Vik, do their very best to make you feel at home.",Ricardo S,/Profile/G6519JVricardos,"Sunny Isles Beach, Florida",50
ladakh,"We loved this place, in a beautiful restored building, carefully modernised. The internal rooms looked very nice but we stayed in a tent in the quiet gardens. Tent does not really do justice to the well designed space with showers and flushing loos. The gardens have chairs and hammocks for sitting and this is a restful place to acclimatise if you’ve just arrived in Leh. Food was good and the people who run the place are extremely friendly and most understanding about altitude sickness. Nimmu itself does not have much to offer (small village with large military base) but it’s not far to tourist destinations and is a great place to start your trip, being a bit lower than Leh itself. We did not really want to leave!",Richard D,/Profile/Richard54,"Wiltshire, UK",50
ladakh,"Our stay at Nimmu House was nothing short of amazing. From the lovely space, to the friendly and caring team, to the wonderful food, everything was perfect.   We spent four days at the beginning of our trip, and Nimmu House was the best place to slowly acclimate to the altitude and get into the holiday spirit. We stayed in one of the heritage rooms that was lovely, cozy, yet spacious.   Only downside to our stay; Afterwards all other hotels seemed a bit wanting.",Hybrid_Nomad,/Profile/Hybrid_Nomad,"Bremen, Germany",50

It is a beautifully renovated heritage house, with stunning gardens and camp sites set in the orchard with apricot, apple and walnut trees and a little stream running through it. The tents are super luxurious and they have thought of every little detail. There are hammocks and chairs scattered throughout the property to relax and read or take a nap. It is the perfect place to acclimatise for a few days or to relax after a long trek or drive. The food here is also world class, and the staff here go out of their way to ensure you have a good time. The yoga classes are a great way to start and end the day, in a beautifully renovated room leading to the temple.

We had two nights, I could have stayed a week.

Absolutely beautiful and authentic, yet every corner is so tastefully decorated.  The room is neat and clean, filled with natural sunlight every morning.

Here even when we were far from the city approx 20-25 kms, we didnt feel the need to move out. The rooms are beautiful made in ladakhi style, infact the whole property.  Moreover what makes this place special are the people, we felt we found some new friends, they were so warm and it was difficult to judge that they are working in the property. the feel is as if they own the property.  Food is amazing and services were remarkable. they havent said no to us for anything and tried every bit of it to make our stay as comfortable as it can be.

Really representative of a very special place, preserving traditional culture, not like main stream accommodations, much much better!

Just as we got to the property, we were led to the main building, a century-old structure, and one flight up to the dining hall/kitchen.  We were guided carefully through the low doors and passages.  The dining hall had this remarkable wood stove that was the center piece and, although not operational at this time, engaged our attention.

It's still being done up.  One drawback was that there's no place around for dinner and you're expected to eat their pricey meal which is just 3 small courses.  There's no a la carte menu for dinner that you can choose from.  It's definitely an expensive place to stay, but for a night, definitely worth it.  Also, internet is only in the main area.

We ate one meal there and it was the worst meal in our entire trip ... thai green curry: congealed veggies and meat in a flour thickened flavourless gravy. CRAP!

ladakh,This incredible property is the perfect place to base a Ladakh itinerary from. We spent our first 4 days there to acclimatize. Tents are very luxurious and were perfect for our family of four.  The property has a 'Provence in Ladakh' feel to it. Very European. All staff were wonderful. It felt like we had forged new friendships that will endure. Food is incredibly fresh and was a real highlight for us. The hotel staff helped to make all arrangements for activities - and there's a lot to do in the area!!  I really cant recommend this property high enough.

ladakh,"Nimmu is a quiet place to relax if you are looking for a place away from all sorts of pollution - air, water, sound, light etc..  The hotel is a restored 100 year old heritage building representing Ladakhi architecture, set in the midst of a farm of walnut, apricot and apple trees, and a stream that comes alive at various points of the day!  We loved the ambience, the food and the hospitality of the staff. The general manager Will Maldinez was a great host and made our stay memorable with his friendly chats and great food.   You would love this place, if you are willing to be in the lap of nature away from the multitude distractions!

Nimmu village is situated in the Himalayas with stunning views of the surrounding mountains, which we could enjoy from the garden of Nimmu House during breakfast and lunch. Sure, you can get the same views in Leh as well, and throughout Ladakh, but you would be missing out on the tranquillity of a small village, the kindness of the local people, and above all the great food and ambience in Nimmu house and the hospitality of the team, in the skill full and experienced hands of Will, the French manager, who attended to our every need during our stay and explained everything about the fascinating history of",Ilse C,/Profile/86ilsec,"Mechelen, Antwerpen, Belgium",50

ladakh,"Most people spend their first night in Ladakh in Leh (the site of the airport) which is fine, but another- and arguably better- option is to drive one hour west to the village of Nimmu near the confluence of the Indus and Zanskar rivers, and stay at the wonderful Nimmu House. I stayed in one of the excellent and comfortable tents, which were both spacious and quiet (unlike Leh). The food was really good, especially the lemon chicken which was absolutely delicious. The staff is friendly, and the only improvements I could suggest would be some better grounds maintenance. I would definitely stay here again!",tigertomPackwood,/Profile/tigertomPackwood,"Packwood, WA",50

The apricot and apple trees were in bloom and we were allowed to pick as and when! It is a great eco friendly retreat from busy city life. Chef Mahesh cooked superb meals which were served in the courtyard in open air as weather was lovely. Sumo is a wonderful lady who is an extremely helpful and pleasant person. Overall a very satisfying stay. Would recommend definitely. Free Wifi is available but in certain areas only.,  We started our journey to explore Ladakh with Shanti travels.

Though we stayed in the house but the tents they have were one of the best tents i have seen till now, beautifully done interior with enough space , nice bathroom with modern fittings.

The food cooked with fresh product from the village is DELICIOUS, especially their homemade apricot jam jar ! The rooms are very charming as well as the tents. The wooden structure makes you feel closer to the nature. The house is full of history and you have to ask the team to tell you. You will learn a lot about the way of living of Ladakhi people.

We spent the whole afternoon relaxing on the hammocks in the garden while drinking the homemade tea. This place is ideal for acclimatization or returning from a trek.  The room was basic but clean and comfortable. Bindu the manager was very welcoming and made sure all the guests' needs were satisfied. We look forward to returning and see how the project develops as it is definitely one of the best places to stay in Ladakh!,Tsiory,/Profile/Tsiory,London,40

The pre-arrival service was fast, efficient and informative, our airport pick up in Leh was right there to greet us and the drive is a very easy (although winding) 32kms past the Indus and Zanskar Rivers -- quite beautiful.  While renovations continue on the historic house, guests stay in five tents spread around the apple orchard -- plenty of room for privacy and lots of lovely hammocks and lounge chairs for stretching and napping. The tents are LOVELY and completely comfortable although they need to work a bit on the hot/cold water in the otherwise impressive bathroom. We slept really well and were not cold at all, although we still appreciated the hot water bottles Bindu the manager gave us before bed. ",Cynthia R,/Profile/PoppyHopper,"Paris, France",40

The hotel is located near Leh and offers a peaceful shelter after a good day of trekking or sightseeing. The cuisine is great (local ladakhi food, yum :-) ). I stayed a week under the tent (by tent, I don't mean a camping tent, but a nice and comfortable furnished tent), in the blooming garden and I really had a good and relaxing time, with a special thanks to the people in charge.
