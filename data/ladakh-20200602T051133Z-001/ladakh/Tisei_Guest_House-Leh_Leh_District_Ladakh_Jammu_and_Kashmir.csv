ladakh,"It's a simple place, but prices have gone up quite a bit and in season it seems a bit overpriced. It is quieter than many places close to the market, but new buildings around it make it feel kind of hemmed in. The courtyard is a comfortable place to hang out.",Peregrineri,/Profile/Peregrineri,"New Delhi, India",30

ladakh,"Ti-sei guest house owner Choppel is terrible guy. I made my booking through online and i paid my money entirely to the online portal( Stayzilla). when i landed in leh at his guest house and told that i have a booking... to my surprises he refused to give a room to me saying the stayzilla haven't sent him money yet. when i paid him  total room fare again than only he allotted a room for me. the next day when stayzilla transferred money to him they deducted 10% as their commission. when i asked Mr choppel to return my money which i paid (since he got the money i earlier paid to satyzilla), again to my surprise he deducted the 10% which satyzilla taken from him as commission. i tried my best to explain and convince him... but he is a nuts ,,, mad fellow wont bother to listen at",Bharath R,/Profile/449bharathr,,10
ladakh,"As a summary: Sheets are not changed Risk of bedbugs Owner is reluctant to keep luggage if you go on a trek You cannot use facilities or keep luggage if you checkout, even if your bus is in the evening  Saw friends throwed by shouting and stones out of the place after complaining and asking for a discount for massive bedbugs bites. 3 people in three different rooms. Owner didn't want to accept the fact and evidence and insisted they were dirty people.  As a recomendation lardakh, chow and nuthula gueathouses were run by people who genuinely wanted to make your stay a nice one. All around same area.",Bernab√© L,/Profile/198bernab_l,,10

ladakh,The room was a very fair price. Room was clean. Courtyard and farm are peaceful. Guesthouse was set off of the dusty roads so the air was clean and quiet.  Owners were very friendly but never overwhelming. Great place to relax for a spell. Would definitely return to this place again. ,James G,/Profile/S4518XHjamesg,"Jaipur, India",40
ladakh,"The Ti Sei is in a very calm street (no moto, dogs, cars,...), but still next to the tourist centre. The hotel is very cheap, and you therefore get basic accomodation, even though it is clean. Water is warm. The lowlight is the poor insonorisations of the rooms. The owners are very kind and the hotel has a very nice shadowed terrase with relaxing sofa,... a perfect place to meet other travellers and to chat. No wifi.",Mathieu P,/Profile/532mathieup,"Brussels, Belgium",40
ladakh,a wonderful place to live if you are a peace loving person and not fond of tv or wifi...the owners and caretakers are very helpful and nice human beings.I had been there for 7 days and place is awesome...highly recommended for budget friendly people and yet you don;t have to compromise much as the place is neat and clean and you can also see wonderful scenes from the hotel's common balcomy...also all the good restaurants are nearby....,utk2014,/Profile/utk2014,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"Stayed in this beautifully located guesthouse for four nights and then went on a trek to the highest mountain in the area. Firstly were we surprised to have to pay to store our luggage whilst on the trek, this has never happened in two years of travelling, and then once we got back from the trek after an exhausting few days we asked to use the bathroom to freshen up before a 19 hour journey to Manali. Unbelievably he said ""no only if you pay for another night. you are no longer our guests.""  Left me speechless. ",stanra,/Profile/stanra,,10
ladakh,"Location: This is a very nice place located in a quaint and narrow by-lane off Upper Tuckcha Road. It also connects you to all the cafes on Fort Road via. another series of nice by-lanes.  Place: It has an open courtyard with plenty of space to lounge, read and soak up the sun. Snow-capped mountain ranges are visible from here. The owner stays on the ground-floor on one side and has rooms available above it. The whole section across the courtyard has rooms (this part does not have attached bathrooms).  Rooms: The rooms are very basic but clean. The rooms above the owner's place have attached bathrooms and a common balcony overlooking the courtyard. The building across the courtyard has many more rooms with shared toilets and bathrooms. If you don't mind this, then I recommend",moreorangy,/Profile/moreorangy,"New Delhi, India",40
