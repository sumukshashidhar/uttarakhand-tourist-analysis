ladakh,"My wife and I stayed overnight at Kailash Mansarovar Homestay and Guest House, Sumoor, Nubra Valley on 19th July 2017. The room and attached bathroom were excellent, so was the dining room, and also the location of the guest house and the views from the guest house and room. The guest house has a small lovely garden in the front, where we could sit or stroll around. The food was simple and totally homely and tasty with just the right amount of oil and spices. It was indeed a wonderful and comfortable experience, a true home stay. Our host Mr. Rigzen and his family were very warm, hospitable and helpful, and took excellent care of all our needs and concerns. We will always cherish our stay here. And we will surely stay here again if and when we are lucky to make more trips Nubra.",SatishGovind,/Profile/SatishGovind,"Noida, India",50
