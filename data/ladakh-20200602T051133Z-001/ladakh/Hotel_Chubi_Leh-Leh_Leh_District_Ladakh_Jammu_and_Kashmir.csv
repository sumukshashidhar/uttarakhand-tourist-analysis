ladakh,"This is a great no-nonsense place to acclimatize and to use as a base for exploring Leh and beyond. Not fancy but comfortable and has character, and a quick walk to the centre of town, cafes close by. The staff are great, always on hand to help you out, and the breakfast was pretty decent.   Rooms are clean and a good size, plenty of warm bedding.",Flo H,/Profile/floh563,,40

The booking of rooms is more cheaper online I made it by make my trip .Hotel rooms are good. Hot water for bathing is more important here. But they might avoid.

ladakh,"Cleanliness - The room stank and although the bed looked seemingly clean it was an uncomfortable experience trying to sleep due to itchiness. The blankets were having a strong smell of chemicals which caused a burning sensation in the nose. It was extremely hard to catch any sleep under such conditions. They were using it as a cloak room prior to our arrival.  WiFi - Very slow and available only near the reception.  Food - Too spicy. High probability of acidity or gastritis. The soup was the worst and the rotis were slightly stale.  Overall hygiene - A dog roams around in the vicinity and even in the rooms drinking water from the glass so beware what you eat or drink here.  Room Service - We asked for one, just one cup of tea which didn't arrive for an hour so when I went to",Rishi G,/Profile/rishiblock,,20

While they are not aware or through carelessness, the Driver took us to Nubra but didn't inform that road to Pangong was closed via nubra (I suspect he was lying).   That too the driver was informing on the day of starting from Nubra. If he knew, should have taken us to Pangong first via different route! but NO!! (since the night was booked at a Hotel in Nubra through them, they doing this business) but ought to ask tourists what they are preferring.   On return, we found our luggage was strewn about carelessly. As if they are doing some great ehsaan ( big favour) by providing room.

I got a chance to visit Leh again in 2017 June and the stay i chose was offcourse Hotel Chube. Mr. Rigzin Chube and his Wife had been too kind with us in not only helping us settle in the rooms but also on getting the required Inner Line Permits which is a must to travel around Leh. Food was great from the cook Shnakar's kitchen. Everyone will feel more like a home staying rather hotel.

Due to bad weather, we had to change our complete itinerary. It was due to wonderful arrangements, everything was taken care of and whole family was very comfortable.  My daughter had Hypoxia issues for which Mr Rigzin promptly gave me all the local help to get her treated in the Hospital.  All the arrangements made in Pangong, Tsomoriri, Chumathang and other stopover places were very good.

ladakh,I think this place would be a lot better in the summer. the hotel itself is beautiful and colourful and the rooms nicely decorated. the owners are very friendly and invited us straight away for chai. the cooking was absolutely delicious too. but I have to compare this place to the other guest house we stayed in leh. chube was more money for less. for instance there was no running water which they said was due to water pipes freezing but at the other guesthouse water was running and we were able to have a hot shower. at chube the water we were given in the bucket was warm but quickly went cold showering in negative degrees. there was also no wifi which was advertised. when I tried to go into a browser a message popped up saying that the bill hadn't been paid.

The next 2 days we were given rooms above dining hall, 113 was big and good, and 112 again small with aluminium channel partitioned toilet.

Seasoned travellers like myself feel pleasantly surprised to see such dedication amongst staff of such small hotels. The room is clean. However there were no cupboards to put my clothes in. So we had to dump it on the floor. WiFi comes and goes and it is very slow. No hot water in the morning since the water is solar heated, so you get hot water only in the afternoon. The owner is very kind as he accommodated our shift in plan and did some adjustment in our stay. But so overall it should get a 4 out of 5 star for value of money and quality of stay. But I give it 2 star because the owner's wife is too money minded and only friendly with foreigners. With indians she is superior",Steve X,/Profile/stevex2015,"Visakhapatnam (Vizag), India",20

This hotel is with very good local architecture and with very good views of typically great Ladakh landscapes. Mr. & Mrs. Sonum Rigzin have been very nice with all the guests and very hard working. This hotel is well maintained and very cleanly kept. Nice open places to sit around and good balconies!   Generally the Ladakhi people are good / honest / helpful. Our driver Tundup has been very nice and highly helpful, when we got held-up at ice-cold weather of Khardungla-pass, for more than five hours! Ladakh deserves good development and it is to be well-utilised by India, for the development of locals. These hotels bridge those gaps!

He will personally take you to airport in his vehicle even for flights leaving in the early morning. Even when you are visiting town and he sees you in the market , he will stop and will take you back in hotel in his car. same is true with his better half who is also teacher and is blessed with soft human touch.

We were impressed the moment we entered by the nice clean place, greerary all across and incredible hospitality from the Hotel Staff. The food is very good, and since we were about 8 people and had occupied mos tof the rooms, most of food was courteoulsly prepared based on our choice. Overall a very pleasant experience. Looking forward to go there during my next visit too :)",DeepakH,/Profile/DeepakH,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,Had the most lovely experience with the hospitality shown by Mr. Rigzin and family. The place was nice and they family was very warm which made us feel that we were visiting friends rather than a hotel. Helped us out with warm jackets when we were heading out for our trek as some of us came ill equipped in clothing and with medication too...  All in all an experience made tremendous with the simple yet caring attitude ...  Cheers !!! Sudhir www.chalukyas.com,Sudhir P,/Profile/SudhirP396,"Bengaluru, India",50

ladakh,"I was here last summer. I booked the hotel online, and since it was really cheap, i didnt know what i was going to expect, or if the place even existed, i had no phone number or email as reference. So, I arrived, with no expectations whatsoever, and was pleasantly surprised with a very small family run hotel, with very simple rooms and facilities.. and fantastic hospitality. People in Leh are extremely nice, quiet, soft people. And so is the family that runs this hotel, i think they are surprised by foreigners and our customs, and often stare and look in awe or with curiosity..  The rooms are warm, made of wood, with hard beds, clean bathrooms, and windows facing the himalayas. The gardens are full of homegrown vegetables with which they cook the meals, and there is a creek of",na_ta_ez,/Profile/na_ta_ez,"Mexico City, Mexico",40
ladakh,"Ladakh is just awesome & this is the hotel I'd like to come again. Very helpful people in this hotel, especially the manager.  First timers usually face the problem of altitude sickness in Leh & you need someone to lend a helping hand. He also gives all required information for first timers. They also provide all facilities for sight-seeing & permits etc.  Hotel is at walking distance from the Leh market The room was clean.  Hot water was available. The View was amazing, Shanti Stupa from one view, Leh Palace from other & beautiful Ladakh Range from another. The ambiance is also good & is a typical Ladakhi architecture. Food was hygienic & good. (buffet meals).  I checked many other hotels & lodges, but I'd highly recommend this Hotel.",Adaddaadadda,/Profile/Adaddaadadda,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"The title is clichéd but its true. Me & my wife stayed here for a week in July 2011. The manager was extremely helpful, just like family, especially when I needed the most, when my & my wife's health went bad due to altitude-sickness.   Access & location: Hotel is at walking distance from the Leh market & yet away from the hustle-bustle of the Leh main road in a peaceful location. Room: The room was clean & equipped with required amenities & bedroom & toilet. Hot water was available. View: The View was amazing, Shanti Stupa from one view, Leh Palace from other & beautiful Ladakh Range from another. The ambiance is also good & is a typical Ladakhi architechture. Food: Food is hygienic & a home-like taste. They have a buffet meals with unlimited food in the dining area. Serives:",jawa,/Profile/vishaljawa,"Montreal, Canada",50
ladakh,"The location is good, 10-15 minute walk from main market. The place is managed by a couple; I must praise them for the amount of work they put as the support staff is very less and is available only during peak season. You will get home cooked food and basic services but don't expect luxuries. The room is cleaned at repeated requests and availability of hot water is always an issue. However, it is probably the same with all similar guest houses in Laddakh. Overall, a good and different experience staying in this hotel.",Dheeraj S,/Profile/87dheerajs,"New Delhi, India",30
ladakh,"A friend and I stayed in this hotel for 10 days and from the moment we arrived we felt at home. The rooms have a traditional feel and are comfortable but it is the garden and kitchen that really delight the senses. The Garden is a oasis of calm,full of flowers and a great place to sit and relax post-trek with a glass of spiced tea. Meals are all home cooked using organic home grown vegetables and many traditional Ledakhi recipes are available to try alongside other indian and European style items. The Dining room has a pleasant communal feel where you can meet up with other guests and swap notes on treks and traveller's tales. The hotel owners, Rigzen and Kunzes are friendly and welcoming and go out of their way to ensure that guests get the best from their stay - you can",mandaj66,/Profile/mandaj66,"London, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"We stayed a week at Hotel Chube and were instantly charmed by the lovely garden and setting and the warm welcome by the owners.. It's located in upper Leh away from the huzzle and buzzle of the town centre however only a short walk away. The rooms are clean and cosy, the garden is great for chilling and outdoor dining and the restaurant offered us some of the best home cooked food we had in India. Everything is freshly made and comes from their organic garden. The owners Rigzen and Kunzes are lovely, helpful and very welcoming. They have many repeat visitors. Trekking and other trips can be booked via the hotel too. I strongly recommend Hotel Chube for your stay in Leh, if not try it for lunch or dinner and enjoy the lovely setting.",prussianbee,/Profile/prussianbee,"London, United Kingdom",50
