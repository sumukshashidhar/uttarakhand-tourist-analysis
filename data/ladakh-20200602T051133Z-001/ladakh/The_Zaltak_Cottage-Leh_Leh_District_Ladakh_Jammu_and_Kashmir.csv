ladakh,"This is a really friendly little guest house. The rooms in the new building are comfortable. I'm not sure if they are still putting up guests in the old house, but I remember those rooms are being really basic. It's at the end of a lane, so pretty quiet. The only downside is that there's a big hotel being built directly behind it. Still, it seems that the noisiest part of the work is done.",Peregrineri,/Profile/Peregrineri,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"This is 'Zaltak Guesthouse'. Only this has a correct address, ""Upper Tukcha Road"".  After my one night in Leh at some random home stay, I checked into Zaltak directly on my way back from Nubra. I couldn't find the place easily at first as I was walking down the Changspa Road and with no network in my phone. So eventually I called at Zaltak using a local's phone (special mention for the Leh's ever so helpful and tourist friendly people), the manager Neerbu (apologies if I have got the name wrong) himself came to fetch me up with a helper who carried my luggage. Phew!! God sent! On checking in, I instantly fell in love with the private balcony of the room with the view of little vegetable garden and lots of plants, bushes and vines filled with flowers. Room service was so good",Trups2411,/Profile/Trups2411,,50
