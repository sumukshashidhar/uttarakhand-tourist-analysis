ladakh,"Right from the owners, Nazir and Abbas who set the tone of genuine friendliness, to the entire staff, you feel welcomed. The rooms are nice, cozy and spacious enough to allow you to unwind after your travels to and around Leh. The ever-smiling Sonam was there when you needed anything at all, Nirmal at front office was ready with anything he could do to make your stay comfortable. We would almost always find guests sitting a chatting with Nirmal, getting pointers on what to do where, etc. What does one say about the food, excellent food prepared by Ram. We were pleasantly surprised when even Nazir, the owner presented one of his signature dishes for lunch - a treat. Nazir also planned and arranged our trip, all we had to do was give him our dates and presto, all planned out and",Jocelyn D,,"New Delhi, India",50

With its mesmerising mountain views, the fantastic service at the front desk by Nirmal or the great home-like food prepared by chef Ram and served up by the ever smiling Sonam one always feels loved here at Hotel Ladakh Heaven.  All this care and service for guests has been a standard set by Nazir and Abbas the wonderful hospitable owners of this lovely property.

The food at the hotel is nice and portions are huge!   The owner and the staff are extremely helpful and help planning your trip as well procuring anything that may be required for your time in Leh. The owner, Akbar is extremely resourceful and helpful. His inputs and assistance made sure we had a great time throughout the vacation even when traveling outside of Leh. We were headed straight for Kargil from Pangong Lake and he offered us a room to freshen up if we decided to stopover in Leh. That is genuine hospitality!

ladakh,I stayed here with 10 companions as the start point of a motorcycle tour of Ladakh. There were no other guests and we were looked after and fed by the tour support crew so it's hard to comment on the hotel staff. Those we did come into contact with were polite and helpful. My room was comfortable with good views of the mountains. Wifi was poor. Only a short walk to the town centre (10-15 mins).,Andrew P,/Profile/andrewp454,,30
ladakh,"We have stayed in total 5 hotels in Leh (even in cheaper ones than this), and experience with this hotel is by far the worst! So worse that we wrote a letter to our travel agent not to send future clients here so that they don't face the same experience as ours,  We moved to this hotel because our earlier hotel was fully booked for few nights. We were told by our tourist agency that this hotel is ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù to the earlier one, but alas.  Hotel Building and room: +New building +Spacious room (not very spacious, but not cramped) -Room does not contain any mirror (disappointment for the ladies) -The only mirror is above the basin in the bathroom, but it is so dimly lit that it is useless -Hotel is dimly lit in common areas and we had to tell the staff specifically to switch on the",Deba_Nandy,/Profile/Deba_Nandy,"Mumbai, India",10
