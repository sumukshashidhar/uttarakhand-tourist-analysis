ladakh,"We booked this hotel due to prior information from other visitors of the vagaries of staying in tents at Pangong. My expectations from this place were nil due to its remote location in Tangtse, a small village about 29km from Pangong lake. The experience however was better than my expectations with the room on the cleaner side. The staff was polite & cooperative & the food quality really quite good. A highly recommended choice not only because of lack of other comparable options in this village but more importantly to avoid the troubles faced by family groups in tents unless you are adventurous to experience the tents at  the lake..",DRPRPANDIT,/Profile/DRPRPANDIT,"Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,"This hotel is located just 35 kms before Pangong lake. It is a beautiful hotel with very reasonable rates. The owner Mr. Nutuk Tsring is a wonderful person, ready to help you. We were treated as owner of this lovely place. The food was prepared to our taste. The hotel is having 14 well appointed rooms. You can see the snow peaks from your hotel room. You can start from Leh cross Chang la and stay at this beautiful place. Enjoy the night here and next day go to Pangong in the morning and go back to Leh.",Nikhil P,/Profile/969nikhilp,"Roorkee, India",50
