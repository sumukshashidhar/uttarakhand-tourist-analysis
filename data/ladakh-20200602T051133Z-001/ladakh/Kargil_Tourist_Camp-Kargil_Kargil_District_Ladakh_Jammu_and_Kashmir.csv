ladakh,"Actually there are two districts in Ladakh one is Leh and another is KARGIL. KARGIL become famous after the 1999 war between India and Pakistan. But KARGIL doesn't know for a battle field because if there is any peaceful place in India that is KARGIL with zero crime, able to walk fearlessly in the street even in mid-night time,very helpful people, very good hosting people...   Kargil locates between Srinagar and Leh. KARGIL's main city locates 200 KM from Srinagar and 230 KM from Leh. Most of the tourist visits KARGIL in the months May-Sept. The road route from Srinagar to KARGIL often close for 5 months in winter due to snowfall in ZOJILA PASS. There are soo many beautiful places to visit in Kargil like war memorials, Glaciers, Buddhist Gonpa's (monasteries), beautiful views,",Haneef,/Profile/rackcho208,,50
ladakh,"This was our first tented accommodation and we were all very excited. This place is a decent place for a night stay while on the way to Leh. Tents are clean, food is also decent and the staff are well mannered. However, staying in a tent with a 3 yo kid is not easy. It gets very cold in the night. However, the staff gave us extra blankets to make sure we are comfortable which was a real help. Also, the sounds that you hear while you try to sleep after a long day are lil scary :D. But overall it was a comfortable stay.",Dilshan_Kunhi,/Profile/Dilshan_Kunhi,"Bengaluru, India",40

ladakh,"We stayed in the Kargil Tourist Camp en-route to Leh. We reached here late in the evening . To start with , there are tents with all basic facilities . The view beyond the tents is breathtaking . The staff here are very helpful . You can also plan a bonfire if needed . Food is good . Would like to mention a small incident that I  missed my bag here and the staff here had carefully packed it and were going to send it via some trustworthy source to my hotel in Leh , an act that was highly appreciable . To sum it up , its worth an experience staying in tents among the mountains here.",PratC1,/Profile/PratC1,,50

ladakh,"We stayed for only one night in the camp, overall good facility for staying & food quality is also good, Staff is really courteous. Also, do not forget to visit LOC as the border with Pakistan is very nearby.",coolanujdel,/Profile/coolanujdel,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",40
ladakh,We stayed in kargil camps on the way to leh from kashimir. Camps were having all the necessary facilities with neat and clean washrooms. Sleeping Beds were also so comfortable. Morning view from outside the camps was super awesome. People there were so polite and always ready to help. They served nicely cooked breakfast to us.,divya k,/Profile/569divyak,,50
ladakh,"A simple camp site, not quite in the nicest surrounding, but the staff aim to make it as comfortable as possible. Nice enough experience, but if you can stay in a good hotel in Kargil, that would be a better choice.",Rj-spark,/Profile/Rj-spark,"Singapore, Singapore",30
ladakh,"Nice option of camping at Kargil with satisfactory food, clean tents, spotless linings and cooperative staff.  Kargil is a place where there are options but good options are less, in that case if you wish to experience camping and want o enjoy vies, this tent is for you.",Dipanshu B,/Profile/759dipanshub,,40
ladakh,"The place is ~5/6 kms from the main city on the NH1 connecting Srinagar with Leh. You can easily imagine this stay as tents planted in the midst of the hill. The view is pretty nice from some sides. The bed is pretty comfortable and tents have charging ports as well. The washroom facilities are pretty basic with direct hot water available from ~6 in the morning.  The do offer complimentary tea during evening but without any snacks. We had carried our own and consumed them rather than asking them to make something. The dinner was served as 1 subzee, 1 dal & 1 chicken dish along with rice and roti. The dinner was pretty homelike. Nothing fancy like what you would get in a restaurant. They have a dining hall where the meals are served and the window seat offers good view of the",vabhatia,/Profile/vabhatia,"New Delhi, India",40

ladakh,"This place is really awesome! More than the place, the people are fantastic!!  We were on a family trip to Leh Ladakh region for 2 weeks from 15th to 28th May 2016 and had got all the arrangements made through Mr. Vilayat Ali - the owner of Kargil Tourist Camp. And I think that was the best thing that happened in our trip planning!! He is such a friendly, knowledgeable and caring person! He has the knack of understanding the guests' likes and dislikes and plans the trip accordingly. Apart from the well known tourist places in the region, it is because of him that we travelled through he lesser known places like Suru valley, Sham valley, Aryan valley and Batalik region and we really enjoyed these places. All arrangements made by him were just superb! These include the vehicle,",Traveller_Talegaon,/Profile/Traveller_Talegaon,Pune,40
ladakh,"We are Wanderlust Travellers.... We had a wonderful family vacation in Ladakh from 15th May 2016 to 28th May 2016.  Kargil Tourist Camp was a wonderful experience. Kargil is less known tourist destination in Ladakh region. It is considered more of a stop over location when you travel from Srinagar to Leh. We were fortunate that we got in touch with Viayat Ali ( we call him Vilayatbhai ), Owner of Kargil Tourist Camp when we were planning our vacation. Before writing about Kargil Camp I would like to write few words about Vilayatbhai..... He is a very caring person, a vivid traveller and a very knowledgeable person who understands the likes and dislikes of his guests. While he planned wonderful trips to often visited places like Sand Dunes of Nubra and Pangong lake he also",sandeepbhise,/Profile/sandeepbhise,"Pune, India",30

ladakh,The stay at Kargil Tourist camp was pleasant and most memorable. We were a group of frnd's and family.All arrangements of food and bedding was excellent.We had an awesome time at the bonfire. The tents were well equipped to keep us warm and cozy.  It's worth experiencing at Kargil Tourist Camp.,Anushreenaik,/Profile/Anushreenaik,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"This place is full of history coupled with the best service staff and home food. Kargil is the best stopover if you love your Army. From the war memorial to the Tololing Hill, the sacrifices of our jawans echo loud and clear. The host, Vilayat Ali is a mass communications specialist and well versed with whatever he does. He was kind enough to show us the last village on the Indian side and our neighbour from there. Under a clear sky he will show you our Army bunkers viewed atop from his cozy tents. A must visit and a special thankyou to the still studying butlers. It was an out of this world experience for 13 of us.",Hiren M,/Profile/628hirenm,,50

They made campfire for us. Both dinner and breakfast that we had there are delicious. They served chicken, veg curry, chappathi, rice and dal for dinner. Toast, bread, butter, jam, cornflakes and Tea in the morning. The people in the kitchen and dining room were caring.

ladakh,"I stayed at Kargil Tourist Camp (KTC) for a night on bike-ride to Srinagar from Leh. The owner of the camp Mr. Vilayat Ali was there on that day. After a round of Kawa & bread, he took us to PoK village Hunnerman to show us the border... it was an awesome experience! Later when we got back, we were treated to sumptuous dinner including a local vegetable Mongol which I must admit was delicious. The tents were clean, spacious, and welcoming. The bathroom was attached to the tent and had hot water running. The linen was clean. The morning after, there was breakfast - eggs, butter, jam, toast & tea. Some wonderful treks also possible but consult KTC before venturing out or you may find yourself in Pakistan :). Overall a very refreshing night stay. Good job KTC!",Irustima,/Profile/Irustima,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Honestly Kargil is not a destination on any bodies travel list due to its chequered history. You can only stumble upon this place when you are travelling between Leh and Sringar. We stopped by Ali bhai's Kargil tourist camp to have dinner. It is the middle of nowhere and that's precisely the reason  it is unspoilt, pristine and seems like a place out of a fairy tail. Go there if you can..:)",Suhel Khan,/Profile/khansuhel,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
ladakh,stayed here on 01/08/2015 on way to leh. the tents are luxurious with neat and clean bathroom attached. the location is very quite and beautiful. The owner Mr. vilayat is very hospitable and takes care of very small things of yours. Also his staff is very polite and always ready to help. Felt very much relaxed after crossing zojila and coming here. will definitely stay here for 2-3 nights on my next trip.,wasesa,/Profile/wasesa,"Pune, India",50

ladakh,"We had a memorable stay at the Kargil tourist camp.   The place is really elegant with a lot of attention to small details including the warm finer blankets, the hot water bottles and the Kashmiri Kehwa to top it all.   It also helps that the hospitality is personally overseen by Mr. Vilayat Ali, an ex travel journalist.  Definitely the best camp on the Manali-Leh-Srinagar sector.",Rajiv J,/Profile/324rajivj,,50

The tents are very spacious, clean and comfortable. Even the attached washrooms are big and clean. The food is tasty just like home food. The owners are very friendly and warm. We were a group of 15 tired and hungry bikers, and despite the problems in sourcing food material and electricity due to the massive floods in J&K the owners took good care of all our requirements. The small farm next to camp adds to the quaintness of this place. You must make time for a bonfire, the night brings in a different hue to the imposing mountains around.

The food is excellent. Dinner was great, but on base of our request they even managed to serve fresh joghurt from the village at our breakfast. Delicious!

Our host was Vilayat Ali which is also the owner and a wonderful person who suggested us to take another route which was much better than the regular route which we took while coming.

ladakh,"Had a great experience staying here. The owner, Vilayat, is a friend but I promise you there is no bias when I say this has been one of the best camps I have stayed in. Clean, spacious, running water - everything one can hope for. Both families and bikers frequent this spot so comfort level must be good for both parties. The added advantage is the location. We stepped out of our tents to see a 360 degree panoramic view of the mountains. You can even see a Pakistani peak - goose bump moment! Vilayat has grown up there so he is full of stories - both pre and post '99. Good food, lots of anecdotes, trips to hidden gems like the Suru valley and Aryan valley. Please stay a couple of days here and explore Kargil fully.  Tip: I personally preferred the tents at the higher level because",Sputnik-girl,/Profile/Sputnik-girl,,50
ladakh,"This charming little camp is by far the best I have ever stayed in. Its perfect location and great view make it the place to stay in Kargil. The tents were the biggest and most comfortable across the many trips that I have been on.   The owner is a friendly and knowledgeable guy and helps out with almost anything thrown at him. He even helped us plan our time in Kargil, advising on places to visit, restaurants to eat at, routes, etc. The camp itself is excellent, with its spacious tents, clean toilets, great view and a very good kitchen. It is not too far from the city center in case one wants to take in the now historic town.   The accommodation and meals are very reasonable by all standards. All in all, this is an excellent place and the best camp/hotel to stay at while in",alexander5upertramp,/Profile/alexander5upertramp,"New Delhi, India",50
