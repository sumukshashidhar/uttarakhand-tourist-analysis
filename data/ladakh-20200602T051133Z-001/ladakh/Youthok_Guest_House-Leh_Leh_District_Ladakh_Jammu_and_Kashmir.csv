ladakh,"We stayed for 4 nights, I struggled with acclimatisation and became unwell. The hotel staff called me a doctor, then went to the pharmacy to fetch my medicine and cooked us dinner so we didn’t have to go out! Felt so welcomed and comfortable! Our room was lovely and the terrace is perfect to sit out on too - also decent WiFi which is hard to come by in leh!!  They are a wonderful family with a wonderful home I would recommend to anyone and everyone ",Jesslockwood27,/Profile/Jesslockwood27,"Heanor, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,-Great place with very nice people -We stay like their own family -Not so far from town but its up hill so may be difficult to walk from town to the guest house -Breakfast included * The best wifi signal in Leh,Hathaipoom C,/Profile/hathaipoomc,,50
ladakh,Hospitality of Owner is outstanding; he is very helpful and attentive. We stayed at room 301 & 302 upgraded free of cost by the owner's. The trace and rooms were spacious. The common dining space is neatly decorated with traditional/ethnic cookware. The breakfast served was simple and homely. We initially booked for two nights and after visiting Nubra & Pangong again stayed for two nights.,Muazzam_Khan,/Profile/Muazzam_Khan,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"We were so pleased to have chosen Youthok Guest House when we quickly Googled an inexpensive homestay for Leh at the last moment.  The family were so kind and helpful from the start and we were given such a lovely comfortable room. We also enjoyed the breakfasts on the upstairs terrace, which were included in the price and we were so lucky to be treated to a very special one one morning - soup and a type of momo.  The inside dining room is a sight to behold - rows and rows of shiny copper and brass pots and vessels and the most gorgeous old stove which I think is Tibetan. Mr Konchok was very helpful organising taxis to the start of our trek etc for us. It was also a great relief to be able to leave some extra baggage at the homestay while we did our trek and we were so grateful",Vivien C,/Profile/906vivienc,"Cape Town, South Africa",50
ladakh,"Hospitality of Mr.Konchok is outstanding; he is very helpful and attentive. Though my booking did not mention ""complimentary breakfast"" but the same was offered as guest house policy. He did not charge for the tea we ordered just after arrival in the morning. He also offered us lemon tea in the evening, for free.  The common dining space is small but neatly decorated with traditional/ethnic cookware. The lunch served was simple and homely. Even here Mr. Konchok’s generosity was evident as he did not charge for my 11year old son. There is  nice common area for relaxing on the terrace. Though the family room (#306, if correct, which is in fact a set of two interconnected double bed rooms with a private bathroom connected through a small covered balcony) we stayed in was",Gowruv,/Profile/Gowruv,"Ghaziabad, India",40

ladakh,"We stayed here for two nights in August 2017. It's a really lovely husband and wife run guesthouse with a cosy homely feel. The wife is an excellent cook and both are great hosts. We really enjoyed our stay and loved that the GH had traditional furnishings. The rooms are spacious and the bathroom was clean. Wifi connectivity was good for the time we were there and the GH has a cute little terrace for you to enjoy the views of Leh from higher up.   We would recommend this as a nice authentic stay in Leh, and would say it's particularly great for couples. ",Prcilla37,/Profile/Prcilla37,"London, UK",40
ladakh,"Guest house is run by charming and welcoming couple who are owner if the property. They take care of your all needs and demand. In one line you would feel you are living in your own house not in any hotel or guest house. Food cooked is just fingerlicious. Aunt nature is very welcoming and charming. I would recommend to every one who are visiting ladakah and want to get the feel of ladakhi culture. They have a nicely decorated ladakhi kitchen, drawing room is nicely placed with comfortable sofa. Room on the first and second floor comes with the added advantage of giving you a nice view of the hills. They even have a small Buddhist temple in the house. Perfect place to have complete peace of mind.  Guest house owner is a nice man he even helped us to get us to main market at night",KUSHAL K,/Profile/KUSHALK138,,50
ladakh,"Amazing place! Owned by kind and generous family that made us feel at home. The mama is making delicious food and tea and hosted us with love and smiles. When one of us was feeling sick the father took us with his car to the doctor! Such a good person,really. The room was clean and cozy with hot water . It is 10 minutes walk from the market. Had an amazing time ! 5 stars from us!",yonatan l,/Profile/yonatanl40,"Tel Aviv, Israel",50

ladakh,Nice guesthouse not close to the main market but located in a tranquil area. The standard room was very basic without hot water and a very bad bathroom. I've asked to change room and they give me a deluxe room that was ok even if there was hot water only in the shower. The good point of this place are the owners who are very friendly and helpful. ,Solange,/Profile/sol13_11,"Milan, Italy",20
ladakh,"This is been my first trip to ladakh along with my husband, and the stay in youthok guest house made it worthy and memorable. We stayed here for 4 days which was among the best of our stays in the whole journey in  ladakh! Wonderful hosts, aunty's endless amount of tea supply anytime we ask for it, with warmth & a smile on her face always is most memorable. Not only the rooms were excellently maintained, the amazing food (based on our interests on what we wish to eat) was also served in the homely manner, as someone said, home away from home definately. We found ourselves one among the family. That extra care the couple have for the customers beyond the limitation is the one characteristic most appreciated. They helped us with planning the travel further too with keen interest.",Shilpa A,/Profile/ShilpaA155,,50

Our friends had already booked the guest house for the trip and we were the last min joiners but uncle/aunty were so accommodating that managed, we troubled them so much by calling but never ever they got irritated... aunty never said no or got irritated with the constant demand for tea/omlette bread.... it was like a home where we sat with them in the living room for long chats.... humble people i have ever came across.... even arranged a transport to airport... it should be the first option to stay in leh!....  we miss u uncle/aunty... god bless u both",chichi_chem,/Profile/chichi_chem,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"I had some inhibitions initially but all those were put to rest, as soon as we checked into this place and met the owners, who tried every bits to make our stay memorable.  This place is run by an elderly couple and they are among the best souls I have come across for a while. The guest house is very well maintained and facilities are no less than a 3 star hotel at the price of a budget hotel. They didn't even charge us for the extra bed ! The food that was served to us was awesome and she would seek our preference before cooking. The mutton momo was the best momo that I have ever tasted. They have a well decorated Ladhaki kitchen, which is a beauty in itself.

ladakh,"Well, to start with, we were a group of 9 people who stayed here for almost a week. To describe the stay, we got the best of the rooms at the most affordable prices. Located very close to the main market makes this place one of the most preferred options to stay in. Uncle and Aunty are the best hosts you can ever have. I mean, they care like your very own parents. I drove a zoomcar to Leh and considering the seriousness of taking self driven rented cars in Leh, uncle and aunty helped me park our vehicle in the adjacent hotel for free of cost for the whole week. Very soft spoken, amazing cook, the best guides and to top it up, they provide you with the best tea in Leh(mark my words for that).  That being said, I wholeheartedly thank you Uncle and Aunty for making our stay a",Lalit S,/Profile/LalitS524,,50
ladakh,We as a group of 9 stayed here for a week and it will be an understatement that we absolutely loved the hospitality. Uncle n Aunty were the perfect hosts. From serving us hot tea to guiding us to best possible destinations/vendors for our needs. The prices are also amongst the most affordable in the vicinity. The property is located very close to the Main Market and hence no long commutes back n forth again n again.   Recommend everyone to please go n enjoy the stay. ,Paritosh G,/Profile/672paritoshg,"Meerut, India",50

The most important thing is about guest house owner; he is a nice gentleman. We never felt that we were staying in a guest house/hotel.  Home like  ambiance was there. Kitchen n dining room was decorated in laddakhi style. The best part, rent was reasonable in the place of lama where a lot of traveler visit in the peak season.",Gopal T,/Profile/gopalt5,,50

Breakfast and dinner facilities are available. Tea and coffee can be served at any time of day on request. The food was served very fresh, tasty & hygiene.   The location is surrounded by beautiful Ladakhi houses. Also, the guest house itself has typical Ladakhi architecture design especially the detailed wooden work on windows. I liked the wooden flooring.  We had to leave for Manali at early morning 4:00am and the house lady served us with tea which shows their warm welcoming attitude.

ladakh,"We visited Leh in late August and stayed at the Youthhok Guesthouse for 5 days. The owners were so lovely and always smiling! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The rooms were very clean, excellent view from the bathroom of a monestry. There was paid TV with English channels. Not too far from town, easy 10 mins stroll down, though 15 mins back up the hill! It is located on the main road so you do hear some honking, but traffic is light in comparison to other parts of India! We didn't get to try the house cooked food in the end, but if we come back to Leh we will surely stay again :) ",DanSam21,/Profile/DanSam21,"Culburra Beach, Australia",40
