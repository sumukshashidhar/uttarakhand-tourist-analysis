ladakh,"We 2, a couple didn't expected anything better on a budgeted rating for a stay in Hunder/Nubra. Hosts are very warm, room with attached washrooms are in impeccable condition but icing on the cake are rooms setup in an outhouse, so this property is a mix of people looking for a warm & cosy stay along with people who want to enjoy the raw of Ladakh.",Hitinder Singh,/Profile/hitinder,"Bathinda, India",50
ladakh,Stayed here or a night. Rooms were very clean and tidy with a lot of space to walk.Food was very tasty and was very homely to relish basic cuisines we expect to have after spending many days outdoors.  In house organic gardens and variety of roses have a lot o contribute to scenic beauty.,garysra2015,/Profile/garysra2015,"Paris, France",50

ladakh,"I visited with my parents in June . We visited the property after 6 hour long journy from Leh . The property was bit on the interior of the Hunder but the moment u enter you feel like you are home. There is greenery all around..the property has beautiful view of the mountains and there is so much peace and calmness . The property is a beautiful from inside as well as outside with a picturesque look. The owner of the property is so friendly and hospitable , that you feel like its your second home.  Dinner served at night was delicious and simple without too much spices which soothes your stomach. Something i felt less was about the number of staff..however they are on their toes whenever you call them. There was limited option in breakfast which i feel they can improve.

ladakh,"we visited Leh with our extended family in October 2017, which was off season for Leh. The resort was one the very few operational at this time of the year and we reached from Leh around 3pm. They normally do not serve lunch, but since we did not get much on the way, the staff (inspite of being alone at that time) prepared a simple meal on our request. The owner and his staff were quite hospitable, good simple n homely meal at dinner, provided a sort of bonn-fire inside a big dining room. It was really nice. The amenities are very basic but think of it like you were getting a good hot meal, warm room with a comfortable bed and hot water at such a remote place and that too in off season, when most of shops and hotels are closed down. we had a good time.",Sadhna l,/Profile/Sadhnal3,,40
ladakh,"Firstly , what they commit they can't.give. This resort doesn't belong to family ..... This is a resort which is a stay place for alcoholic persons Food is pathetic and when did complaint to owner than he said "" Jo hai yahi h "" Very rude owner and he told me "" humara resort esa hi h "" ......  This resort is seriously a black spot on whole laddhak. Even I saw a Camera in the holder of bulb in the  room. I  am attaching pic of that. Whole Laddhak and Laddhaki people are really very good. This type of people really creates bad image.",Manish J,/Profile/398manishj,"Mumbai, India",10

In future if I come to Nubra valley I must stay there.",Atis B,/Profile/atisb,"Kharagpur, India",50
ladakh,My room was just perfect for me and my friend. Sand Dunes was the best hotel that fit my budget as well as luxury and there were no problems during the stay. The owner Sonam ji is an excellent person who told me a lot about Nubra valley and guided me regarding the tour. The view from my room was so spectacular that I just didn't want my stay there to end. The time spent there would always be one of my fondest memories. The garden there is amazing to laze around or to take a stroll.,Anisha K,/Profile/AnishaK108,,50

ladakh,"We went to Leh Ladakh last year in Oct first week and spent 2 days at Sand dunes View guesthouse in Nubra valley which is very near to the place where m Movie Mirzya was shoot. The nature and sand dunes view from the guest house was awesome and thus I found the name of the guesthouse as apt and complete. The hospitality provided by them was very good and the food was tasty and hotly served. Lastly, we also got the opportunity from the owner to eat the freshly grown apples. Therefore, I suggest this place as the most apt and right for everyone who wants to spend their time peacefully.  Nikhil Khanna",Nikhil K,/Profile/NikhilK1281,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"After a spectacular trip around Ladhak, the Sand Dunes view guest house fell a little flat. It's a decent hotel, but the rooms aren't very clean. The food is average. We were given bottles as soon as we came in exhausted but later found out that it was charged (@1.5 times the MRP).  It's still a very decent hotel to stay in.",Mohan Karthik,/Profile/MohanKarthikP,"Hoskote, India",30
ladakh,"We planned to stay at sand dunes a little longer at night as everyone wanted to lie down on sands and star-gaze. Hence checked-in to the hotel very late at night. Hotel Staff provided us with dinner late night as well. The property also has a terrace where we lied down to star-gaze and watch clouds move. It also has a speaker setup, just in case ur in mood to warm-up your body by drinks and dance.",Rohil V,/Profile/rohilv,"Mumbai, India",50

ladakh,"We had booked our stay with another Home stay but inspite of booking and confirmation a day before they cancelled our booking citing flimsy excuse but we thank God as it turned best thing for us. Sand Dunes View was the best staying place we can have in Nubra. Enjoyed the beautiful property taken care by Mr.Sonam the owner, a very helpful n caring person. The price was Rs.1500 for a spacious room with awesome view. And food 250 per person. Recommend to Gaze the beautiful sky in the night and visit a small water outlet nearby at walking distance and enjoy the morning solace.",priyesh8947,/Profile/priyesh8947,"Mumbai, India",50
