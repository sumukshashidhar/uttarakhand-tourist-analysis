ladakh,I visited Ashoka guest house six month ago in month of july with my Brothers. it's good place for stay. I stayed here from 1 to 8 july and it's very nice place. It’s a budget hotel. Ashoka guest house is very near to main market At out side there is one small beautiful garden. Owner and staff both are very friendly. it was good experience ,SAM_SMARAT,/Profile/SAM_SMARAT,"Surat, India",50
ladakh,"I had stayed there with my two cousins for about 8 days and it was a pleasant experience. I've got the room at the corner and it was very good little bit old fashioned but best for staying. The staff was very friendly even i asked for extra blanket they instantly gave me. Only few things which are annoying thay it was the last corner room there was hardly accessible to the wifi, so we had to get into hall in the garden area to use wifi and there was no place in room to hang wet towels. And yes there are some rooms which is having toilet common. These rooms were really good and that toilet was also neat and clean. And in my room there was not any fan as initial impression i was shocked but after staying there i came to know that it's not necessary. At the end it was a present",Vaibhav_Tailor,/Profile/Vaibhav_Tailor,"Surat, India",50
ladakh,"Two month ago I visited leh with my cousin brothers. I stayed For 7 days at here. From 1 July 8 July. It’s a budget and family guest house.  Owner and staff both are very friendly. Room is big , simple & very neat and clean. Out said there is a small garden, very nice sitting arrangement. It's about 10 minutes to main market. It’s very good place for stay.

ladakh,We found this most pathetic so called guest house . This is around 4 kilometres away from the main market deep inside a narrow Street very hard to find  the room allotted to us was badly stinking with seepage with no ventilation   There is no arrangement for food or hot water  One stupid looking girl and her father claim to be owners of this गेस्ट हाउस  When we complained about our problems they started shouting at US and scrupulously we were forced to leave at 11:30 in the night  Guys never go to this place and spoil your vacations,DhirajKakkar,/Profile/DhirajKakkar,,10

I had a nice, clean room and the whole building is well maintained. Also the family is very nice and they always will help you if you ask. It was also very easy to meet other travellers, especially at the nice terrace outside. I really enjoyed my stay here and can recommed anybody to come to Ashoka.",Martin_MH91,/Profile/Martin_MH91,"Leiden, The Netherlands",50

ladakh,This was our first few days in Leh and we heard this was a good place for backpackers. Although we didn't really feel it had that backpacking vibe the rooms were very clean and had a telly with some working channels but not as good as some other places but it was so much cheaper we didn't expect it to be perfect connection. The people were friendly although didn't speak a huge amount of English but you are in India so... was nice to get a smile. We only booked 2 nights but stayed 4.  Wifi- any reviews re wifi being weak or to working at all: yes this is the case for most of the time BUT you are in a remote area where the wifi can go down for days at a time and it's only where they have very good wifi through mobiles etc that you can access the wifi.

ladakh,"The staff was very friendly, understanding and helpful especially the grandmother at the hostel. I would really want to thank her! She stayed up late on the first night till our group was back to ask us if we had any needs. The breakfast was pleasant and simple (Omelette, Toast and black tea). We purchase bottled mineral water directly from them. The wifi at the guesthouse was strong in the early morning. It is understandable that wifi in Leh is often very slow during the daytime. The mattresses were abit tougher but we were quick getting used to it. There was enough warmth for the cold nights. They were very accommodating and we arranged extra mattresses in some of the larger rooms because we were a huge group. Thank you Ashoka Guest House!",Alexander Lian,/Profile/Alexanderlianww,,50

On my last day for free cancellation i.e-1 month in advance of check in, i requested the hotel to cancel my booking as i came to know that its location is far from market and in an isolated area.I dint receive any reply till the date of my journey approached. So i went on with the booking as otherwise i would have to pay them Rs.1200 for cancellation.I reached the hotel on time and was greeted by the lady owner, my mobile wasnt working in Leh so i asked her for a favour to allow me to make a phone call back home that i have reached safely but she refused to help clearly.

So if you are travelling alone (like i did) you are bound to meet interesting people. 5-10 mins walk to the market area - good location. Clean rooms and bathrooms. Rooms are a bit cold though.

ladakh,"We stayed at The Ashoka Guest House in the end of April. At first they were nice to us (even though they could hardly speak any English at all). We went for a three-day trekk and they let us keep our baggage there for free which was nice.   One bad thing is that it is really cold in this Guest House. Like even colder than it is outside sometimes. If you come in April you have to count with approx 5-10 degrees Celsius inside. They have hot showers, but you have to switch on the hot water tank manually around 45 mins before your shower. Something really annoying is that someone in their staff doesn't want you to have your hot shower. Therefore they go and switch it off, like after every 10 minutes.

ladakh,"What makes a good accommodation? A friendly welcome, a nice room, a central location and a reasonable price. Ashoka Guesthouse has all of it. It's just a five minute walk to the marketplace (therefore more quiet), our rooms were clean and with a comfortable bed. It`s excellent value for money. But most impressive was the hospitality of the family. Always a smile and helpful with advice regarding our travel plans. When my dad was developing signs of altitude sickness they assigned a driver to take us to the hospital and accompany us during the examination. We stayed at Ashoka Guest House multiple times during our Ladakh trip and can highly recommend it.",Chris D,/Profile/chrisd0506,"Munich, Germany",50
ladakh,Worst place I have ever stayed at by far. The owner lady is very egoistical and unfriendly and gave this impression since the moment we reached. She even gave drinking water as if she's doing you a favour. They detest giving you hot water for bathing. The only saving grace about the place is the friendly old gentleman owning the place but he's negated by his wife and daughter. They lie on their website that they accept credit cards- they don't. We checked out two days early and went to stay in a much costlier place just to get out of this horrible place. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.,Kaul D,/Profile/kauld2014,,10

ladakh,"Ashoka Guest House is one of the best thing happened to me in Leh. We stayed there for 5 days. When you are at such high altitude you are worried about basic amenities like hotwater, blanket and a good food. But the owner and staff makes your stay easy. They personally take care of everything. Owner aunty is very supportive and helpful. She communicates with everyone who stays in their guest house and give suggestions for travelling also. They can also arrange a taxi for you at a reasonable price. It's not too far from the main market so you get the no noise rooms plus the convenience of the main market.

We got accommodation here at around 1200 INR Per Night which is very decent . Though food options are limited but you get good home cooked food here in Breakfast & dinner .  For the price and services available ..this is one of the best .

ladakh,Ashoka GH is tucked away from the busy main road where we pretty much enjoyed a quaint environment. The hosts are personable provided us useful info and  helped us to organize accommodation at Nubra. Breakfast is also available upon your request and the host kindly allowed  us to customize our own breakfast and not forget to mention about providing local touch by serving us with local butter tea!  There are a few items can be improved e.g. Hygienic of washroom and stability of hot water. No fuss too much about pros and cons about this place as we consider about value of money we paid and what we got ( and compare with facilities and infrastructures in Leh) !Over all it s still pretty good deal!

If you are Indian don't bother to order breakfast, they serve toasted bread with butter jam for Rs150 per person. The reason for low rating is because of very good options available on same road at same price. They charge 1200 for room with attach bathroom and 900 for rooms  with shared bathroom.

They have many windows with nice mountain view. The rooms are clean as well as the bed sheets and towels. Both rooms come with a seating area, equipped with comfortable chairs and storage space.  The Ashoka guest house is located in a quiet but central area with good restaurants nearby.  The family is welcoming and exceptional friendly. On site breakfast and laundry service is offered.

The guest house is run by a family but the response over mail or phone has been good. I arrived early morning and was immediately provided with a room.  The room was just average from all angles, may be size or decor or furnishing. The breakfast was not included but even with the cost there were very limited choices. The taxi stand and the market was around 1 km. There were few restaurants on the way to the market serving breakfast and main course.  The Internet facility was there but during power cut, which has been a regular feature you were cutoff as the guest house has no fall back arrangement during that period.

The personnel was very unfriendly, the bathroom wasn't cleaned for ages (with soap stains all over the place), bed linen were dirty with hair... We received a room next to the reception: dark, noisy and it had bars...we felt like we lived in a prison. When we asked if another room was available, we received a very rude NO.

It had a beautiful view of mountain peaks in the distance and warmed up in the afternoon sun. After looking at dingy, dusty, dirty, and dark rooms for the same price (without wifi even), I realized what I had. Finally, the family.

We accepted, making it clear that we would not be paying for that night. They agreed, we slept well and were moved into a room the next morning, and all seemed fine.
