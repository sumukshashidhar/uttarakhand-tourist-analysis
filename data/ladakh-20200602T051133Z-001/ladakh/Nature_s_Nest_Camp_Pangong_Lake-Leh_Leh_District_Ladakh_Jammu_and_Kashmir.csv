ladakh,We stayed one night at the wonderful Pangong lake. The camp is very well maintained and gives un hindered view of the lake since this is the first camp site from the lake at the particular location. all other camp sites are behind this. We enjoyed the full moon reflection in the lake as also sunrise from our tents.   The camp site is very well maintained and camp are very modern equipped with good washroom. The staff is nice and polite and very much helpful However would have liked more if food was better and also dinning area more neat and clean. However given the location this was excusable.   Electricity is available for 3-4 hours only in the evening and they provide one emergency light in each tent. Due to environmental reason they only can boil 500 ltrs of water using Solar,hdg63,/Profile/hdg63,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,Stayed here for one night. Staff were helpful and service was good.  Camps are beautifully located right on the banks of the lake. Was well maintained. The food could have been better.

ladakh,"Natures’ Nest camp is the farthest down the road when you are driving to Pangong. This makes it slightly remote but very peaceful. It’s literally on the banks of the Pangong lake so don’t bother stopping anywhere on route. The tents are very comfortable and as close to luxury as you can get with the limited resources in this region (read no electricity, limited telephone line). The tents are well insulated and have zip locks at the entrance which keeps the tent warm. The washroom was very modern and had all amenities. Service quality was superb and the staff were more than helpful. The only flags would be that you get hot water only from 6-7am in the morning. This is mostly because the water is heated using solar energy and hence supply is limited.  Highly recommended if you are",SnehaBeriwal,/Profile/SnehaBeriwal,"Mumbai, India",40

We could not find a soul to give us drinking water. It was after a lot of complaints by all the guests staying there that we were served water. Travelers, please be aware that the power comes only between 7 pm to 11 pm so your cell phones can only be charged during that period.

ladakh,"We had booked this camp basis the reviews on trip advisor, however due to a change in itinerary I called the point of contact ( guy called Phuntsok) to request for a refund of the booking amount. On the phone he promised a 100 percent refund and I offered to collect the refund when I was in Leh ( I even dropped an email to him to document this conversation) and all this was done before 1 month of actual travel. Once we reached their office for a refund, our experience was horrible and shocking. Phuntsok denied of having any conversation with us, and on us showing the email we got the reply "" I get 150 emails a day, I did not notice this one""   The argument for culturally very disturbing where we were blamed because we were from big City Delhi - and we were being rude to",Neh09,/Profile/Neh09,"New Delhi, India",10
ladakh,"Pangong Lake is unarguably the best place in Leh to see, and Nature's Nest camp is closest to the same. The camps are little old and ill kep, hence we had to chose among the 4, but finally we got a good one. Food served was very good. Tashi-the team leader is very helpful person there. The staff is very cordial and supportive. Overall an excellent experience at Pangiong Lake. The view is the best part",sukrit1783,/Profile/sukrit1783,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40

ladakh,"When it comes to hotel's and camps the only words that matter are...location, location and location! And what a location Nature's Nest Camp has. Right on the lake shore of the surreal Pangong Lake.   The tents are spacious with double beds, ample quilts to keep you warm and a bathroom with running water!   Run by the gracious Mr. Phuntsog and his uber friendly manager and staff, I felt completely at home at Nature's Nest. The manager even got me beer! And yes, I did have beer on that cold chilly night.  Good food. Friendly people and a view to die for.   The moment you wake up in the morning and open the door Pangong hits you with all its glory.  Sip on some hot tea...relax and enjoy your stay at Nature's Nest.",gaurangmenon,/Profile/gaurangmenon,"Mumbai, India",50

ladakh,"We stayed for one night 22nd August in Pangong Lake. Before leaving Delhi, we had gone through details of number of Camps in internet and also had telephonic discussions but when we reached Pangong lake most of the Camps were at higher altitudes and quite a distance from Pangong Lake. We decided to stay at Nature Nest Camp which was the nearest walking distance to reach Pangong lake. The tent was ordinary but location wise it was perfect. The owner was quite hospitable who provided us with warm food in dinner and also breakfast with bread butter and jam.",cmlkapur,/Profile/cmlkapur,"New Delhi, India",30

Overall awesome experience of staying in the tent...highly recommended",SumanKumar1,/Profile/SumanKumar1,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"The Natures Nest Camp at Pangong Tso is very well located at the banks of Pangong Tso which is ideal to walk along the shore of the Lake taking in its mesmerising beauty. The boys running the camp provide prompt service and the food served is fresh and fairly good which is quite commendable considering that Pangong is located at a very high altitude and is at a fair distance from available supplies. However since the camp is pretty old, the tents are a bit worn and the sheets and duvets could definitely do with some improvement. It would be a good idea for the management of the camp to invest in duvet covers so that guests can have fresh linen on arrival. All in all the staying experience is basic but decent.  At Pangong the lake and its ambience is so beautiful and awesome that",Shabz52,/Profile/Shabz52,"Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,"There is not much choice, an overnight stay in Pangong does mean staying in 'swiss' tents. All through Ladakh you find these temporary camps to stay and this was sadly one of the worst. Just a couple of hundred meters from the breathtaking Pangong lake, the location is a no brainer, wish they put a bit more cleanliness and overall joy for being so close to one of Earths most beautiful spots.",avtaar,/Profile/avtaar,"Mumbai, India",20

ladakh,"Once we reached Pangong lake, we were just stunned with the beauty of the place. We had a night halt at the Nature's nest camp at Pangong lake. It was a basic accomodation with attached toilet bathroom. Clean and maintained place. enough rajai's and blanket to keep you warm at night. Food was good quality and taste although limited in variety, I was actually impressed by their hospitality in this harsh weather condition and difficult terrain. Limited hot water and electricity but can't complain as here you go to enjoy nature. One suggestion do take your ear plugs especially at night when the windy weather noise might not let you sleep. But stay there for a night rather than going back the same day which could be really tiring.",CJain,/Profile/CJain,"Mumbai, India",40
