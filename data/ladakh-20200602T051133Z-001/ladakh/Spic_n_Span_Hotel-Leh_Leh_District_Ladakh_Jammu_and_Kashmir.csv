ladakh,"I had visited Leh for 8 days in July2019.  My stay at Spic-n-Span was superb. The hotel has a very beautiful building. It is just a few minutes walk from the main market.There is a nice open air central court for sit-out. The rooms were just right, clean, comfortable. There restaurant serves buffet breakfast & dinner. So there is food for all choices. The kind of crowd at the place is mostly international. My room had a great view of snow capped mountains far away. The hotel had arranged a complete package for me. viz : (stay & travel back & forth) at Nubra & Pangong. This was really helpful & hassle free. Their free wifi, really helps to connect to the world since pre-paid phones don't work there,  Nothing really to complain !  Wishlist :   A good coffee machine.

ladakh,"There is little to say that was good about this place – with the exception of location which is close to the main market area in Leh. It does not live up to its name - the rooms are dated and gloomy with an over abundance of wood and peeling paint. Other members of our party had issues with cleanliness and plumbing. No water was provided in the room. Reception was decidedly unfriendly, restaurant staff were surly (eg would not lay a table for us outside for breakfast). Erratic wifi.",Richard D,/Profile/Richard54,"Wiltshire, UK",20

ladakh,"In August I traveled solo to Leh. It was my first solo trip and I was very nervous and anxious. I am going to spend the next 15 days in a completely new place and I barely know anyone there. And my first interaction with the people from Leh was at the hotel. And it took me not more than few seconds to feel at home. It's common to receive warm welcomes generally in the hospitality industry.  But here.. their bright smiles were on a completely different level.  Such genuine and warm people. Since I was traveling alone and was there for a long time this was very essential for my stay.  The view from my windows were absolutely beautiful.

Actually all the hotels here are locally operated and have their own quirky issues.   I stayed in three different rooms and all were very differently styled. Just finding your room is challenging. I recommend asking for the inner facing rooms away from the road and roaming dogs who bark at night time. Bring ear plugs just in case. Be thankful there is at least there is hot water for a shower.   Location is good and about 5-10 mins walk to town.   Hotel restaurant provides a very simple buffet breakfast.

The exterior of the hotel is beautiful, reflective of the style that permeates the area, with the rooms being large and well kept.

Location of this hotel is perfect as has it has a beautiful garden and the hotel is very close to main market  Food is very average as has no taste. It is just that you have to eat that you have food but don't relish the same. Bathroom s are in bad shape. Rooms are very old and needs renovation as we had rats in our ceiling and we could not sleep whole night. Not a value for money. The staff is good as they gave us a warm welcome.

Since it is one of the big hotels in Leh, they do have a lot of guests. Rooms anywhere near the stairwell will produce a lot of noise. If this is not enough, you have to bear the early morning loudspeaker from garbage collection vans which spends quite a lot of time near the hotel, it is just terrible! We left the place because of this. Their territory is clean. They welcome you with traditional Ladakhi scarf, hot beverages and cookies. Internet works only at the reception.

We were a women group who had gone for the trip. We were staying for 3 different days during our trip in this hotel. The rooms given to us had a bad view (gutter view). The worst part was in morning there used to be tremendous noise in morning of shutters opening & Machine runnings.  All 3 days the rooms given to us had bathrooms with broken flushes. On last the day we were allocated room number 315 which wasn't cleaned at all. eatables used  by previous guests were still lying there.
