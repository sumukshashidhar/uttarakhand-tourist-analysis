ladakh,"We stayed there for 3 nights. Right from the time of our check in till we checked out, one thing we loved about this hotel was their super attentive and ever smiling employees - front desk, restaurant, or any other staff .. They were quite experienced and seemed always eager to make our stay as comfortable as possible. They would ask us if we needed hot water, they would help us with our luggage till the room and also entertain any other request from us..  on the day of check out, they even packed our breakfast(sandwich, cake, biscuit, juice and a fruit) quite early in the morning.   Rooms are newly renovated and spacious espcially the ones facing the garden and Shanti stupa. From my room i had a fantastic panoramic view of snow cladded mountains.

Service was super friendly, location was great- just the right distance from the hustle and bustle of the leh market, which was reachable via a 15 minute walk, but far enough away for a truly tranquil stay.  I understand some of the concerns about distance and safety of walking on the narrow road, but imho that is an issue with India in general.  The hotel has a beautiful garden with superb views.  The hotel manager arranged drivers for our trips; the cars were clean, drivers safe.

Either you have to walk down hill for around 15 min to reach the main market (up hill if coming from market area to the hotel) or you can take a taxi at a nominal price.

We stayed in this hotel on a group tour in ladakh.Food is delicious,service is seven stars.The staff all are so curteous and helpful.The rooms are clean and good. The view is superb from any rooms. They cook their vegetables from their own garden and vegetarian food never tasted better. Mutton is also one of my favourite here. They make not only Indian but also continental food.If you need assistance in anything you need only to ask. I would go there again .Their taxi drivers are also very good ,careful driving and very helpful.",nan_devi,/Profile/nan_devi,"Chennai, India",50
ladakh,"When visiting a new destination, I often look for the newest property for the simple reason they usually have the best / trendiest rooms.   If you are as fussy about the room decor & cleanliness then this certainly is the Best choice in Leh. The rooms were uplifting and fresh, and almost all have a stunning view.   Much has been praised about their serene location, great lawns,and warm hospitality, all of which I second wholeheartedly.  For me the room mattered most and I am all praises for them.",Ashok64,/Profile/Ashok64,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"We stayed 2 nights before our trek and just one day after the trek. The hotel is new, clean and comfortable, staff is kind and helpful. They kindly kept our luggage during these 7 days.Location is away from the city centre, more or less 15 minutes uphill: going down is not a problem, going up you can catch a taxi for 100 rupees. View is amazing (stok kangri and shanti stupa), especially on sunset, dawn and night.  I give ""only"" 4 stars just because hot water is available only from 6 to 9 am and pm, but it is a general problem in Leh, only very few hotels have it all day long. But if I will come again to Leh, sure would stay here again.",marcoaUH,/Profile/marcoaUH,"Munich, Germany",40

ladakh,"We had a lot of apprehension while getting to this place, the narrow lanes and the distance from the main market had created a lot of doubts in our minds. As soon as we reached the place, the first thing which strikes you is the view from the hotel. It has one of the clearest views of the mountains from the rooms, you can also see the shanti stupa and the Leh monastery and palace from the hotel.  Adv Great views Clean bathrooms Hot water twice a day for three hours Decent food and restaurants   Disadv Very far from the market, takes about 20 min to walk up and down to the main area. No transport to get back to the hotel. Walking during night was difficult due to no street lights. Food, very expensive if you do not go for a meal option.

When we left Bangalore, we were apprehensive about the facilities available and the type of food we would be served there. But right from the moment we entered the hotel to a great reception, we were taken care of so nicely by the owner Mr. Dorje and the manager Prakash, we were reluctant to return !!! The staff were great and if we wanted something, all we had to do was just mention it and it used to be done in minuites with smiling faces alround and creating a feel good factor which is hard to find even in many of the top hotels !!

ladakh,"This hotel is situated a ten minutes walk from the center of Leh. The hotel was fully booked when I arrived, but they offered me a room (with discount) in a new wing they are constructing. This room was clean but very simple. Maybe the rooms in the main building are different.  The service of management and staff is outstanding. E.g. for a trip I had to leave very early in the morning, still they offered me breakfast at 4.45 a.m.! Great advice and arrangement of several private trips (Leh area/Nubra Valley/Pangong Laka). They also arrange the permit you need to travel in this area. The meals (breakfast/lunch/dinner) are very good. If I ever visit this area again, I will definitely go back to this hotel.",AlgonPhotography,/Profile/followalgon,"Den Bosch, The Netherlands",50
ladakh,"What was good: 1.)Newly built, neat,clean 2.)Comfortable bed 3.)Clean toilets,bathroom 4.)Hot water. 3 hours in morning, 3 hours in evening 5.)View from the hotel 6.)Lawns  7.)Staff courtesy  What was bad: 1.)Wifi only in lobby area,not in the rooms 2.)No heaters in the rooms. They have some reasons that heaters consume oxygen and stuff but there are some hotels which have heaters with technology that doesn't consume oxygen 3.)Breakfast was pretty average. No fruits,juices etc.   What could have been better: 1.)Meals were simple and fortunately did not cause any health trouble to anyone in our group, however the menu needs to be little bigger to address holiday mood. 2.)Facility to travel to the market. may be a cab on call.

Hotel Royal Ladakh was a great experience. The staff were so friendly and helpful. Speacial mention to Sharma and Chaudhary.The owner, Mr. Dorjee was very co operative.  The drivers attached to the hotel and who took us around Ladakh were the best I have known. The rooms were clean and comfortable. There was running water and hot water whenever we required. The food was good. The cultural show arranged for us by Dorjee was good. It was on the lawns of the hotel and tea and snacks were arranged. We felt like VIPs and that was how we were treated.
