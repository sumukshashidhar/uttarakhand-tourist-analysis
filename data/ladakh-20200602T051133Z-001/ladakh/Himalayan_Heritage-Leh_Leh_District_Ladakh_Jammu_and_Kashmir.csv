ladakh,Our stay at Himalayan heritage was great. The hospitality by the hotel staff was extremely nice. The cuisine was excellent. The hotel was clean and cosy and our stay was comfortable. The knowledge of Ladakh and the planning to visit various places that was done by the owner - Mr Stenzin was fantastic which made our trip memorable.  Would definitely recommend people to stay at Himalayan heritage.,jolsri,/Profile/jolsri,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",50
ladakh,"We were a group of 8 people and stayed there for 8 nights. Good & comfortable place to stay. Staff is very cooperative, friendly & polite. They take good care of their guests. Hotel is neat, clean and well organized. Hotel has a beautiful view of mountains/hills all around. There is a prayer wheel just next to the main gate of the hotel. And itâ€™s amazing to start your day and journey by rotating the prayer wheel. Acc to Buddhism, simply touching a prayer wheel is said to bring great purification to negative karmas and obscurations.  Food is tasty, yummy and the best is, its fresh. Mostly vegetables are plucked from their kitchen garden just before they prepare the meals. This is something you miss in cities like Mumbai, Delhi and you will surely fall in love with this.

ladakh,"This was my second visit to stay there. Yes staff is friendly but rest is just so so. The room in which  we stayed had hairs on bed and on pillow so we have to ask them to change. Our bathroom had four holes in the bathroom, which was not a pleasant thing.  Food is so so. Most of the time we were served only one veg and dal. Variety of food was missing. If you organize your trip / car through them then be careful about the car timings and hotels they book. We booked through them and camp at Hunder was not at all worth the price we paid and Sarchu was even worst. If we say staff was pleasant and helpful that does not makes any guarantee about the staff when you visit there because staff changes there every year so I can't make any comment on that for future. It is an alright",satyendra t,/Profile/kaysatyen,"Bandhavgarh National Park, India",30
ladakh,"The rooms were spacious and well equipped and the staff friendly and helpful. The view from our balcony was superb. We enjoyed the food. On the downside, the bathroom had been splashed down but not actively cleaned into the corners and edges, and the internet was intermittent. At night there were many dogs barking and the road outside can be noisy with cars and motorbikes. That being said we liked it - and it's convenient to walk into town as well as being close to Shanti Stupa.",Adam D,/Profile/S5188NJadamd,"Burry Port, United Kingdom",30
ladakh,"I went to Leh in 2010 with my family and we stayed in Himalayan Heritage. Nice simple rooms and with all basic amenities. The staff was extremely helpful especially during the flash floods in 2010 - all the guests were nice enough to accommodate few outsiders as well - as there was a threat of more rain.   Has excellent view from the hotel, a bit of a walk from the market but that is a nice thing for me. The food is average nothing extra ordinary but sometime when you are traveling for long you would prefer home cooked food and this is exactly what it felt life.  All in all I would say a very good place to stay for the price you pay.",Vasu84,/Profile/Vasu84,"New Delhi, India",40
