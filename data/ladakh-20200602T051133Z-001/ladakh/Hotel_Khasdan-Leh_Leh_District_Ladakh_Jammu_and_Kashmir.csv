ladakh,I was visiting Leh with a friend and the travel operator had booked this hotel. The service was excellent and a large part of it had to do with the staff. The rooms were well maintained and the view from our ground-floor room was shockingly beautiful. Would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Leh. ,Mukul Pareek,/Profile/marshalhannibal,"Kozhikode, India",50
ladakh,"I had visited Leh during 9th September-16th September 2018 and stayed at this hotel during the trip. Hotel has very beautiful view of mountains, valley of flowers and natural greenery. Rooms have nice interior. Hotel staff is very much supportive/helpful and arranged my trip to Nubra, pangong and local site seeing.  It was worth staying there and would love to visit again. Thanks for hospitality. See you soon.",Pavan Gupta,/Profile/Pavang1991,,50

ladakh,"We, a group of 11 motorcycle riders and our crew stayed at Hotel Khasdan on 15, 16 and 19 Aug during our tour of Ladakh.  The hotel is located a little away from the City and that is the good part of it, you experience tranquility. The surroundings of the hotel are lush green, flowering plants and apple and apricot trees in full bloom. There is a small field / garden where some vegetables are grown. The views from the Hotel are magnificent.  The rooms were clean, spacious, well lit and ventilated. Hot water in the room. There is a wi-fi at the reception, which worked intermittently depending on load. Note that in Ladakh only BSNL and Airtel post paid connections work well - that too at limited places.  Hotel and restaurant staff took good care of us.  Service was timely, the",VJ1974,/Profile/VJ892147,India,50

ladakh,"The hotel is located a little away from the center, but in the middle of greenery. The owner and all the hotel staffs are very friendly, polite, eager to help. All the rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. The hotel has its own restaurant that serve delicious food. Hot water is available in the bathroom. WiFi is there but has network problem. Only BSNL & airtel network works.",Nandita D,/Profile/505nanditad,"Guwahati, India",50

ladakh,"Far away from central Leh, small and dirty rooms and rude and lazy staff. The only thing good was the food and the restaurant staff who were pretty accommodating. The hotel does not even have a functional phone.",Dips2k,/Profile/Dips2k,"New Delhi, India",10
ladakh,"Far off from the town, it costs Rs 150 to go to the market. Did not have warm water for 3 of my 5 days there. Rooms are ok. Food is good. Average in all aspects. Wi-Fi was not working. Not recommended for those who want to do a lot of local sightseeing/marketing. Very little to engage kids either",VineetBh,/Profile/VineetBh,"New Delhi, India",30
ladakh,"Hotel khasdan is located away from populated area/market. It gives cut off feeling, no shops are at walking distance. Taxi from hotel to market costs rs200 and drop from market to hotel costs rs150. Rooms are quite big. Hotel resturant doesn't offer good food (at all):( and wifi was not working most of the times. Rooms don't have heaters, but recieved  hot water bottle on request.  ",Priyanka M,/Profile/priyankam05,"Bengaluru, India",30
ladakh,"Hotel is calm and quiet. Rooms are neat and clean. Staff are friendly and cooperative.  Food is average. But if we specifically request in advance, kitchen staff will try their best to comply. Hotel is away from town. You have to walk 10 to 15 minutes atleast for getting taxi. It is a budget hotel. Internet is very slow and works only at reception area. No grocery / convenience store nearby.",gvr50,/Profile/gvr50,"Visakhapatnam (Vizag), India",30
ladakh,"The rooms are just about the only feature that is comfortable, the food was bad, the service was terrible and one gets the impression that they do not have a clue as to what ""Hospitality"" is about. Completely avoidable unless you have no other option.",rohit s,/Profile/rohitsabherwal9,"New Delhi, India",20
ladakh,"Hi,  I stayed in this hotel last week. It was a pleasant stay there.  Key notes are a) far from the city : about 10 minutes drive from leh market , Taxi charges 150 Rupees one way. b) Wifi connectivity isnt that great. c) Location of the place is great. d) 24/7 electricity is available e) hot water : morning 6 am to 9 am and evening 6pm to 8pm f) food is decent enough. g) hotel staff was good .",praveen k,/Profile/15praveenk,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,"Khasdan was a pleasant experience. It's right in the middle of Leh, but is still away from the regular hustle-bustle of the town. The lofty mountains surrounding the hotel look beautiful from the rooms and balcony. Food is average, rooms are good enough for a budget hotel. The staff is friendly and take good care of you. Overall, I'd recommend it as a good choice for budget accommodation",Arunav1,/Profile/Arunav1,"Pune, India",40
ladakh,"Do not expect this to be a fancy hotel. It is a decent hotel with neat clean and big rooms. The hotel is perfectly located. 10 min drive to the market and airport. The food is really good. They have a wide variety to offer. They also make what ever we feel like eating. Only thing is they do not clean up the room and make beds everyday. Since we are hardly in hotel we did not really mind. They staff is very very helpful. I would definitely recommend this place. A very comfortable stay.   If you plan to shop at Leh, buy it from Hall of fame store. They are very very cheap when considering the market.limited variety, but if you like you get the best rates.

ladakh,Hotel is decent but the location is not that great. Wifi and network issue was the only pain else all was okay. Staff was helpful and nice. you can't expect much of the luxury at such as rural place .,Ansh_2608,/Profile/Ansh_2608,"Indore, India",30

ladakh,"As part of our ladakh trip, we stayed in this property for one week. The rooms, dining hall, lobby are very clean. Rooms are spacious and ventilation is soo good. The staff is also so courteous and very helpful.  Pros: Location: Good view of mountains and very peaceful. Away from the crowded market. Food: Best food compared to other restaurants in ladakh. Staff: Very helpful Garden.  Cons: Market is 3km from this hotel. Taxi drivers will charge 300 for roundtrip from hotel. Powercuts - for two nights we don't have the power.   We went in summer and we took the room facing the garden. As sun sets at around 8.30pm, we felt that room was very hot and if we open the window, it was very cool and windy. So please avoid room facing the garden.",KrishnaSrivatsaN,/Profile/KrishnaSrivatsaN,"Bellevue, Washington",40
ladakh,"I live in Hotel Khasdan in August, 2012. The hotel is awesome....very neat & clean. I booked a package of Leh Ladakh for 1 week & live in this hotel. Some positives i found in this hotel :-  1. Great location as far as piece & scenes are concerned.  2. Staff is very helpful in Hotel.  3. Organic garden around Hotel & Hotel use vegetables from garden only (as Hotel personnel told us).  4. Cleanliness (very good).  I found hotel very well to stay except some things :- (a) Laundary facility is not available in Hotel (I gave my clothes for wash & press, they returned it after 3 days without (b) Market + Doctor is far from Hotel (as excursion is very common problem in Leh & oxyzen needs very frequently to someone not very fit so hospital is a problem).

ladakh,"The hotel is average even by ladakh standards. Few basic things one should understand when visiting ladakh is that this is going to be a adventure trip and not any regular kind of tourist sightseeng. Hot water is available fro 6-8 in morning and evening. Power cuts and low voltage are quite frequent. There is no genset backup. Good warm blankets are provided and bed is quite comfortable. Only postpaid airtel,aircel and bsnl mobiles works here. Hotel does not even have a landline facility available here. Though manager was kind enough to use his mobile for receiving calls. Nearest calling facility is around 1 km walk which is quite a bit in region like ladakh. Taxi charges around 100 bucks from market to hotel. Kitchen is closed after 10 so whatever you need should be gathered",mohitmangal,/Profile/mohitmangal,,30
