ladakh,"A very warm welcome with comfortable and peaceful stay with the best hospitality and care. Travelling from +23 deg to -5 deg temperature. It seems difficult, but their support and hot tea and home cooked food made worth staying. Cozy Evenings with heater on, warm mornings, followed with the best itinerary. The staff, was very nice, happt and always there for your help. Mr. Muzambil (manager), Irfan (caretaker), Basant (Cook), and our Driver Zakir all did their job very well. Muzambil bhai was always there with the complete knowledge of the local place. Irfan help us in arrangin all the small necessary things. Basant made us some very good lip smaking Momos (must try) and Zakir drove us to all the difficult terrains with such a ease.  Overall the stay was very comfortable and our",Amrit Singh Chand,/Profile/amritchand,,50

Location: 4/5, Interiors 4/5, Heating System: 4/5, Service: 2/5 (You've to ask for the drinking water, toiletries, etc. no proactive service) Food: 2/5 (Pathetic food, even after the instructions)  No intercom: Guest has too walk down and ask for anything, No WiFi, I'm totally disappointed with the property.

ladakh,Small cosy place has been surrounded with good view of the town. Comfy rooms but the cleaning is not properly done by the staff. Also the wifi was very weak and break all the time. All these factors can be improved just need some attention.,Matijmot,/Profile/matijmot,The Netherlands,40
ladakh,"We had stayed in this place for 3 nights. This place is 4-5 Kms from airport and 5 min walk to Leh Market. Since this place is centrally located, you will find most of the trekkers in the place. The food was homely. It tasted good and staff were very polite and humble in serving the food. The hotel staff were very cooperative and helpful.",Vivekhanand,/Profile/VivekhanandC3,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,Very bad experience during my stay  Lot of things need to fix  Hotel room are very dirty.they don‚Äôt even change linen for new guestü§≠  TV don‚Äôt work and bathrooms were not clean  All room are used by trekking agency or cyclist so it‚Äôs very dirty in lobby also. You see cycle or big bags outside room as rooms are shared with 2-3 people.   Also hotel is location is very bad. Lot of dust around as well as DOGS fight and bark in middle of nights.  Staff will try to cheat you if you want buy permits or rental motor bikes or taxi so beware   Food was good and kitchen staff was nice.,kenpat123,/Profile/kenpat123,"sanfrancisco,ca",10

They provide very good service. The staff is very humble and kind. We would like to secially mention Mr. Irfan for providing us great room service and the owner Mr. Rakesh for his advice and help for planning our trip around Leh. The food provided they provide is very homely and tasty.  All in all, the place is worth its price.",Resh_Sk,/Profile/Resh_Sk,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,"We spent 5 nights in this place. Good value for your money. Clean rooms, helpful staff, simple but delicious breakfast, nice rooftop,  close to the city center. Good overall experience.   The only problem is the walls and doors are thin, and Indians like to make noise, a lot of noise, so you are going to hear everything: your neighbours will listening to Bollywood music, loudly, and they will talk even louder in order to hear each other, random Indian bikers will arrive from Srinagar at 1 AM and they won't care that you are sleeping, they will shout and make noise at least until  2.30 AM. This is of course  not the hotel's fault but still annoying a little bit. ",Istv√°n So√≥s,/Profile/752istv_ns,"Kuwait City, Kuwait",40

ladakh,that's the place to be in Leh!!. I felt at home at the first minute. Budget stay for good value! The people from PVGH are great and very helpful. The rooms are clean with a fantastic view to the Palace and the Stupa. Shower is hot hot hot - after the trek the best place to be :-). the terrace is the perfect place to relax!  Thank you for making my stay in Leh so pleasant!,guenfue,/Profile/guenfue,"Salzburg Region, Austria",50
ladakh,"This is so close to main bazaar that in a day you can do 5 rounds to the bazaar without being tired .  View from the last room with a balcony is awesome and magical - if you book this , take the room with a balcony . (201)  Only disadvantage with the balcony room is poor ventilation .  Slow room service .  Another disadvantage is - to find the route via road to this hotel is a mystery .  Free wifi is there but when in Leh forget Wifi   Roof top sitting place is also awesome",Anmol Deep,/Profile/andeep28,"Bengaluru, India",40

Their stay with Wasim and his team has become a huge reason for their trip being memorable. It is not really the poshness of the hotel that creates memories. It is the people. Thank you Wasim!

ladakh,"We were at the guest house during the Chadar Trek 2018 as part of accommodation provided by the trek company. Given that Leh has mobile data plans issues, we were earlier (in other guest house) relying on wifi. And bang - the wifi at Palace View doesnt work (it‚Äôs just a show-piece). Unprofessional staff - said heater would be on only till 10 pm and we layered accordingly and slept. Was woken up at 2 am owing to excessive heat. Suddenly at 3 am the heater is stopped and cold kicks in. In nutshell, the entire night‚Äôs sleep was disturbed. Takes atleast 3-4 follow-up to just get water for bathroom. Shabbily maintained (especially bathrooms) with no doors‚Äô latches working. Rooms like bunker with no direct sunlight too. Room quality and cleanliness - 1/10.

ladakh,"After arriving in Leh to do the Chadar Trek, Palace View was my starting accommodation organized by the trek company. Unfortunately being the unlucky person I am, mother nature decided to make it heavily snow that week so the trek was cancelled. Thanks to the awesome local staff, they welcomed us for the week even though the place was crowded and organised nearby trips and hikes for us. With the difficulties of such cold weather, the people here always made me feel warm and welcome and made my visit to Leh unforgettable, if I ever go back to have a second attempt at Chadar I'll be sure to check in at Palace View Guest House again.",Izel T,/Profile/466izelt,,50
ladakh,"Me and my boyfriend stayed in Palace View Guesthouse for many days. Whenever we returned to Leh on our trip we went back there, since we felt very welcome. The guesthouse has probably the best view you can get...;) From every room (we were in several) and the roof top you have a spetacular view onto the palace, the fort and the old town of Leh. The rooms are very cozy with a lot of wood and a proper duvet. The hot shower doesn't work in every room same good. On the ground floor it's a lot better due to the water pressure I suppose. The people who are running the room are super friendly and did several small favours for us.  Something small that I really liked about the place was a waterfilter where you could refill your bottle for free.",Flurina Z,/Profile/FlurinaZ,"London, United Kingdom",40

ladakh,"Palace View Hotel is located near market area and closer to the Leh Palace. The hotel is a budget hotel and has all the facility required for a comfortable stay like clean rooms, blankets, hot water (geysers), wifi (only near reception). One thing that stands out I the courteousness of staff, they are available when you need and are ready to help. Mr Wasim, Irfan are the ones in hotel who are always ready to help. They also help in arranging local sight-seeing trips, cabs, bikes for rent etc. Few things to improve are, the availability of kitchen (we only get tea), wifi availability in rooms, wester style lavatories etc. Overall its a good hotel with good amenities.",GuruPrasad80,/Profile/GuruPrasad80,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,"I was given a very basic room in the 2nd floor with just a bed and a room heater. There was no attached bathroom and one had to walk out a little distance to be able to use the bathroom. The room door had an improperly working lock. I had to call the hotel staff from my phone after I locked myself from the inside. Later i was explained a makeshift arrangement to use the door lock. Hot water arrangement was disappointing too. I was told a bucket of hot water would be provided in the morning, I found that rather unimpressive since at a place like Leh, that too in the winters, the least they could've done is ensured easy hot water supply to their guests . I was told there are better rooms with attached washrooms and other facilities, but since all other rooms were already booked I",BhaskarSrivastava,/Profile/BhaskarSrivastav,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",20

ladakh,This hotel is equipped well with basic amenities. It also has wifi which was a surprise to me. Generally clean and good for stay with friends. If you are going with family beware that this may not fulfil your expectations. One of the positives is its closeness to the Leh market and shops. You can walk to main market and restaurants from here. The staff is courteous and helpful. ,Anand A,/Profile/625ananda,,40
ladakh,"This Guesthouse was the most confusing place I've stayed in India (in terms of good or bad). I arrived fairly late from Srinagar and got given a room that was comfortable, had a TV and plenty of warm blankets. This was for 500 Rupees which I think is a good price.  However the rating I give to rooms usually applies to the great staff who work there, not particularly present in this Guesthouse. There was one gentleman who ran the place but he was not there very often, and when there was someone at the front desk (which was far and few between) he didn't speak English, and was not particularly helpful.   I went trekking for a few days and the Guesthouse kept my main bag for me which was great, but upon my return, the aforementioned worker at the desk tried to get me to take a",Vincent1995,/Profile/Vincent1995,"Leeds, United Kingdom",30
