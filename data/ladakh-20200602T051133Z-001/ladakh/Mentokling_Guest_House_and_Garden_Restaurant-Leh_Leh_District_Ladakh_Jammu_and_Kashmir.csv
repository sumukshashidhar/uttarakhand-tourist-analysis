ladakh,"really love this place! very tidy and clean, the owner is fun and well organised everything especially taking care all the guests! I definitely will come back this place near future!  新しい施設ではないですが、よく掃除されていて清潔感があります。何よりオーナーが気遣って声を掛けてくれたり、本当によくしてくれました。ツアーはオーナーを通してブッキングしたところ、色々融通を利かせてくれました。 レー自体はもちろん素晴らしかったのですが、心に残る素敵な場所に泊まることができたことが、いい思い出になっています。 ",yu m,/Profile/213yum,"Saitama Prefecture, Japan",50
ladakh,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here due to the owner MR. Sonam. He made our stay comfortable and he arranged our visit to other places like Turtuk, Pangong, tso morori and Nubra. He made sure we have a good driver and he also booked our hotels at above places which were also really good. This place is worth the money. The guest house is located very close to Leh market. The rooms are very cozy and comfortable, hot water was available throughout due to solar panels.  Mr. Sonam explained us to take it easy for the first two days, he checked our oxygen levels on both the days and made sure we were feeling fine. Mr. Sonam is the speciality of this place.",Ranjana,/Profile/ranj_patil,,50
ladakh,"I’ve tried to stay here many times, always at last minute and it’s always booked. The owners of this place are kind and smart, they hire the best and keep everything running smoothly.  I booked from the USA 2 months before arriving. Was a bit more expensive than the other places I was considering but I wanted to stay once. I didn’t realize at the time but I’d booked their Bollywood penthouse cabana. Wow! Was a very private room on the roof, gorgeous well appointed suite! Great light and the best bed I had in Ladakh. Ask for ‘bliss’ room if you’re interested.  Sonam and family are extremely knowledgeable about Leh - especially the growth and business history and he shared some great stories with me. An absolute gentleman and a pleasure to spend time with.  In my opinion if you’re",Eric C,/Profile/doppioeric,,50
ladakh,The owner Sonam and his family and staff were very helpful in adjusting our itinerary and making our stay perfect. We stayed there for about a week in between all our trips; it’s the best base you need in Leh! Very central location and extra clean rooms. Get the big room on the roof if possible! ,Alexia B,/Profile/504alexiab,"Brussels, Belgium",50
ladakh,"This is our favorite place to stay in Leh. Ideally situated 100m from the city's Main Bazaar, Mentokling has spacious and comfortable rooms. Sonam, the owner, is a wonderful person, extremely helpful, honest and very knowledgeable about Ladakh.  I'd advise to always go through him to book a car, a motorbike or other services, we used his recommendations several times and he always recommended honest and competent service providers.  I would recommend him without the slightest hesitation.",MathieuJV,/Profile/MathieuJV,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"Nothing fancy. Clean sheets, clean bathrooms, hot water , a humble and helpful host Sonam. Excellent location and serves one of the best honeylemon tea's in leh. Sonam and his Dad are legend's in mountaineering.",Raoul_Dsouza,/Profile/Raoul_Dsouza,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",50
ladakh,"This place is like a underdog, amazing in terms of hospitality, location - leh market is hardly 5 mins far, attached restaurant which serves various cuisine at very reasonable rates and they have open air restaurant which allows u to see the sky while enjoying your meal. They play movies, live matches on big screen during evening and all this at a very reasonable price. We loved our stay, only stayed for 1 day since we had booked Nalanda hotel for rest of the stay in leh ( another amazing place to stay, owner is very warm).   I would love to stay again at this place whenever I visit Leg again. Gonna recommend to friends too.  Thanks Mr. Sonam.

ladakh,"The property is located just next to the market. The sunlit rooms are spacy and comfy. All travel arrangements can be made by the owner upon request. Go for ""The Bliss"" room if you want full privacy and complete access to the terrace.",royjay2018,/Profile/royjay2018,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"This property is a guest house owned by a gentleman who climbed Mt. Everest at the age of 23. Located close to the Leh market, Mr. Sonam Wangyal and his energetic son Mr. Sonam Wangchuk run the Indian Mountaineering Association office and the Mentokling Guest House respectively from within the premises where the family also stays for around 6 months of the year. The ambience of Mentokling Guest House with its in-house restaurant is simply amazing, and the rooms are just extraordinary. The amazing weeks that we spent in Leh was made much the more amazing by the hospitality of the hosts. When in Leh, go for Mentokling Guest House for sure........and I'm told they are adding more rooms to the property soon. Thanks Sonam Jr. for hosting us, and for making our holiday in Leh even",Lovers_paradise,/Profile/Lovers_paradise,new delhi,50
ladakh,"I booked my trip planned in May’18 well in advance for my family. I booked 1 room for 7 days (17/5/18-24/5/18) in Jan’18 thru Booking.com and after booking, Mr. Sonam, probably the owner, immediately asked for 50% adv for confirmation, which I paid in good faith. Again, in April’18 middle, I was contacted both by Booking.com and Mr. Sonam that I have not confirmed my booking as I have not paid any advance. I was totally shocked and contacted Mr. Sonam and sent my payment transfer details to him for booking confirmation. Eventually, due to sudden illness of my mother, I had to cancel my trip and accordingly I informed Booking.com and Mr. Sonam about cancellation of my booking well in advance in 3/5/18. I requested for return of my advance 10325/-, which was totally refused by him",Sankar,/Profile/SPCHAKRABORTY,"Mumbai, India",10
ladakh,"There is so much to like about Mentokling Guest House.  The location is fantastic.  An easy walk to Leh's main bazaar and nearby attractions, as well as Changsan Road.  The rooms at Mentokling are large and well furnished, and the bed is quite comfortable.  There are plenty of blankets for chilly nights.  The place is also kept immaculately clean.  All that is enough to highly recommend the property, but the best part is the owners!  Sonam and Tashi and their family are amazing hosts.  They will literally do anything for you to make your stay more comfortable, as well as help you arrange tours, taxis, etc. I hope to return soon!",gonertw,/Profile/gonertw,"New York City, New York",50
ladakh,"A family run guest house. Sonam the owner was very helpful and can sort all your needs if you ask. Spacious clean rooms with lots of storage. Very good location and good food. Leh itself has many electricity blackouts, the guest house has a generator for lights but not sockets. Wifi I found to have a slow speed most of the time and of course, reliant on electricity, so was often not available. I personally would recommend this guest house. ",KEN G,/Profile/D5768LRkeng,,50
ladakh,"The place to stay in Leh! The location of Mentokling GH is perfect- on Changspa road, but next to the market. the rooms are spacious and clean and the showers were nice and hot...wifi (although not great) was actually the best we found in Leh.  All that aside, the best thing about Mentokling GH is the lovely host Sonam. What a guy!  He is full of good information and insights and very helpful - no request too big or too small. Super warm and kind hospitality which really helped make our short time in Leh so amazing! We hope to visit again soon, or have our new Lah friends come visit us in Thialnd! :) Next time we come to Leh we will be back at Mentokling!  What an experience!  5 stars!",missamyc,/Profile/missamyc,"Phuket, Thailand",50
ladakh,"We stayed in Ladakh 16 days. During our stay Mentokling guest house was our home base and we returned to it when we came back from the trek and from our motorcycle trips to Nubra valley and Pangong lake.  This is the most perfect guest house you can find in Leh. Located in a quiet alley but just 2 min walk from the center, the rooms are spacious (not to say huge.... room 102) and spotlessly clean (rare thing in dusty Ladakh). The garden restaurant has delicious food (butter chicken) and the most friendly staff, welcoming the guests with a huge smile.  But above all, Sonam , the owner is making the difference in staying in that particular guest house. With a humble attitude and a great smile he help each and every one of the guest with any question and problem. Once we came back",shay m,/Profile/426shaym,,50
ladakh,"The host, Sonam ji, is quite a wonderful man! We were supposed to stay here for 2 nights, but due to some change in plans, we arrived a day before. Sonam ji was very kind to offer us help with the accommodation, arranging motorbike and permits for the trip through his acquaintances, and also went out of his way to help us with the a tricky situation we were in with another bike rental company.   He is a very genuine and friendly person and has to offer a wonderful property for accommodation. We felt at home due to his hospitality, and are glad to say we made a friend in the process. I hope we can visit again sometime!   Julley - like its said in Ladakh!   Gautam and Denise",Gautam M,/Profile/464gautamm,,50

The owner's sister also owns an hotel in Leh (the Lotus Hotel, also very nice) so they are really accommodating if there is any problem with either hotel.

ladakh,"Mentokling, was our first stop at Leh and our introduction to the wonderful state of Ladakh.  Sonam , the owner, made us feel at home and was extremely helpful - with arranging for bikes, helping us out with route maps, tips on the city , restaurant options etc.   Positives : Big rooms, clean and airy. Centrally located. The food at the inhouse restaurant was great, clean and the service was always with a smile. The owners :) Negatives : WiFi was not available the first two days, though we do understand that this was a problem in all of Leh and not just the hotel.  Would definitely recommend this hotel.",RamyaRaghu,/Profile/RamyaRaghu,,40

ladakh,"We got to Leh and found ourselves in Mentokling guest house. We had no idea how lucky we were to end up here. Beautiful, large rooms with clean sheets and am amazing family who runs the place. They invited us to drink black tea with them every morning, and did everything possible to make our stay there unforgettable. The location is perfect, and the morning we left the owner woke up (at 5:00 a.m.) to walk us out!  Can't say enough good things about this place!",650jude,,"Jerusalem, Israel",50
ladakh,"We stayed at Mentokling from 13th to 21st september, some night we left the luggage there and stayed at remoter location as part of our itiniary. Its definitely one of the best places I have stayed at. The owners are really warm, welcoming and helpful people. they helped us a with a local number so we could call our dear ones, told us about the places we could visit, helped us book bikes and cabs are cheaper than market rates, helped us send post cards and so many things.  Also the uncle who stay there were at one point the youngest indian to climb mount everest, and sole survivor of a clash between ITBP and CHinese forces in the ind-sino war and had a lot of interesting stories to tell.   all in all it was a very memorable stay",Rajput_Mayank90,,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50

ladakh,"When a friend and I arrived in Leh, Ladakh late on a summers eve in August we were clueless to where we would stay throughout our two week stay. After bumbling down the main street and poking our heads into a couple of dodgy hotels we stumbled upon this little gem at the bottom of the Chang Spa road. Greeted at the door by a friendly face we thought we liked the look of Mentokling and needed just a quick butchers of the rooms and courtyard before we were sold on the place.  The stay was fantastic and I could not speak more highly of the landlord who goes by the name of Sonam . He was the best of blokes that was always happy to lend a helping hand with any query and did all he could to help guide us along the right path during the stay. I don't say this often but take a bow",Tom M,/Profile/tommO8147KI,"London, United Kingdom",50
