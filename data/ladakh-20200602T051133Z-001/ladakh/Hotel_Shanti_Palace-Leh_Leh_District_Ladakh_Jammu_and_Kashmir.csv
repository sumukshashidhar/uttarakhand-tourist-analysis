ladakh,"Not just bad but fraud also. When we checked in we paid 2000 rupees in advance but later when we were checking out the manager denied receiving any advance from us, they don't give receipt for your advance payment. we have to argue with the manager for almost an hour how to make him understand the truth. We stayed at this hotel during 20 July to 24 July. Only house keeping staff and service staff were good. Manager name Mr Shailendra was so rude, he don't allow to go on the terrace, he infact charged us 20 rupees for a bowl of sugar served in the room. Tea is only available during the morning times. They don't take the responsibility of your baggage in case you want to leave it on the reception.",Abhishek Paul,/Profile/AbhishekP06,,10
ladakh,Visited Leh - Ladak in the first week of June 19 and stayed at Hotel Shanti Palace. Rooms are Specious and neat and clean and well maintained. But difficulty is all rooms are not same. Some rooms you can get view of beautiful snow capped peaks of the mountains but others are with no good views at all. It is two storey building without lift. Steps are quite steep. Senior Citizens may find bit difficult.  They boast of free WiFi but it was never available. Most of the time they said Server is down but otherwise also WiFi was never working. Add to the problems post paid  Jio Mob was also not having signals making life very difficult. Their room service was worst ever I have experienced. Morning cup of tea would take 30 to 45 minutes and several requests n reminders. They are short,Harish Thakker,/Profile/407harishthakker,"Mumbai, India",30

ladakh,"We 4 couples went on a bike trip to Ladakh, from Manali and stayed at this hotel. Rooms were fine as per the average rates in the area but that was it; everything else was terrible. Hot water was available only for limited hours. Toilet rolls were not there, even though holders were there in the toilet; when we asked the manger for the same he said - ""nobody ever asks for them so we don't keep them"" - he must be thinking of us as some sorta aliens!  Parking was limited. The staff, as well as the manager, were arrogant and utterly impolite; not just to us, but to others as well (Man, the way the manager got irritated when another guest repeated a question to him for routes to Nubra Valley!!) . The staff didn't even bother to help in carrying our luggage and were just watching us",Deep B,/Profile/DeepB241,"New Delhi, India",10
ladakh,This hotel is nearby the market and the food was good. Apart from this therevis no point staying in this hotel. Our stay included dinner and breakfast. They told us to order the food for dinner so we have ordered. During checkout he added the bill of our order saying that kadai chicken cannot be included in dinner. We asked that then why did u say us to order? Finally we had to pay extra money for 2 days of dinner even though we had dinner included in our booking. Bed was good. Room was not that good. Not worthfull. ,kaushik r,/Profile/747kaushikr,"Hyderabad, India",20
ladakh,"Hotel situated on dusty narrow lane. Noise and dust inside hotel due to construction work. In this cold climate,  hot water is available for only fixed two hours in the morning. Wifi is very weak and unstable.  Most of the time,  it is unavailable.",Sub C,/Profile/SubC1,,20
ladakh,Located in the city center itself. Neat and clean room with Wi-Fi at some public areas. Friendly staff. But parking was a problem. We stayed there for 03 nights. It's an accommodation with value for money :),Abhishek R,/Profile/258abhishekr,,40

ladakh,"Dunno how effectively my review is going to be helpful for other ppl ! Especially innocent travellers !!! So, here it goes...  Had free wifi, but not working. Phones in rooms disconnected & in broken conditions !  Location is gr8. It's close to market. But, don't get fooled becuz of this thing !  Main receptionist is a local guy who is accompanied by his wife, little son and sometimes other family members. 2nd person who works as receptionist cum waiter is a Jammu guy !  When we checked-in the hotel, this Jammu receptionist denied to pick the luggage when asked ! He asked us to pick our luggage ourself. Later we saw them picking luggage of other customers who had come in bulk there !  The 1st recptionist had also started changing his colors once we had checked-in !

ladakh,"The hotel location was good but rest of the experiences was too bad & horrible! We were a group of 7bikers,after a long ride from manali reached leh & opted the hotel as we didn't have any prior bookings ! We were planning to stay there for 3nights but had to drop the option due to the following reasons 1. Even when the rates were high,The room shown to us before booking was good but the room they gave us while check in was miserable. 2. Hot water was not available most of the times. 3. Food was served & chosen for us on the interest of the hotel manager rather than the guest & it was like you eat this or don't eat anything. 4.entire staff at the hotel didn't know what hospitality is & behaved like goons.The way they looked at, made us feel like we were refugees. All this made",dipaksuresh,/Profile/dipaksuresh,"Trivandrum, India",10
ladakh,We stayed here for as many as 6 days. The hotel is a 10 min walk from the main market and local restaurants. The hotel has two decent balconies that can accommodate 15 people each and give a pleasing view of parts of the town including the shanti stupa. The hotel management is from U.P. and knows your taste. The staff is extremely cooperative. Food is prepared after consuting you on your taste. Issues: 1) Wifi was an issue throughout our stay. 2) the hotel feels a degree Celsius cooler from inside than the normal temperature which could be an issue in the already cold town of Leh  Overall the hotel is decent compared to what you generally get at Leh barring the 3+ star dragons.,parth1505,/Profile/parth1505,,30
