ladakh,There are many Options for Camping in Nubra. Nubra summer camps is located little away from sand dunes. They have Around 10-15 tents with attached bathrooms. Well maintained camping site.  They arrange a Bonfire in the evening (chargeable).   Food was the only thing not upto the mark and could be much better. Rest all good.   ,Rahul Jain,/Profile/travelfundaa,"Bengaluru, India",40

ladakh,"Nice place to halt in the middle of the sand dunes in Hunder, surrounded by the colourful mountains. Improvement needed in the quality of the food and it should match the price that the tourists pay for the stay.",Lovers_paradise,/Profile/Lovers_paradise,new delhi,40

Hope to visit this place once again.",priyanka c,/Profile/739priyankac,,50
ladakh,"The camp is little far from Diskit and Double Hump Camel park, but very good and calm. Lovely hill just behind the tents, and lots of fruits tree and birds, lovely night to see the stars. Tents are spacious and bed is good. A hanger in the bathroom to keep the clothes and toilateries like shampoo, tooth brush, tooth paste, and of-course a moisturizer would be highly appriciated. The staff is very helpful, the food is ok but the plates and bowls are not properly cleaned.",debasis2k,/Profile/debasis2k,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,One of the good place to stay near to the market. Good rooms and nice hospitality. Value for money. Rooms are spacious and service is also at par considering the value which is been paid. Best thing it is at walking distance to market.,Mayur_Ghodasara,/Profile/Mayur_Ghodasara,"Ahmedabad, India",30

ladakh,"""We're going to stay in tents. What facilities would be there? How is it going to be?"" - these were some of the questions that were in minds before we walked in. Once there, all our doubts were quelled. Have not seen more comfortable tents. The tents had almost all the facilities that we could hope for in a hotel room. It was a very nice experience and the food was very good. There was also a campfire at night and that only added to our experience. Overall, the experience at Nubra Summer Camp was very satisfying.",ashwinmurali1988,/Profile/ashwinmurali1988,"Coimbatore, India",50

ladakh,"We were directed to this camp by our travel agent when we found `Cold desert camp`, which was originally booked, much below our expectations, and we were not disappointed!  ( We wasted more than 1 hour in changing the camp, though, should not have happened in first place! ) The camp site is situated in interiors, the tent is  spacious and attached bathroom is tiled and cleanliness is passable. For internet  buffs, it has free wifi, which works quite well ! Location is good, surrounded by mountains. The food was of average taste. Staff was courteous and helpful. In all, a good place to stay in Nubra, but I am sure better options would be available!",prakash jotwani,/Profile/prjotwani,"Ahmedabad, India",30
ladakh,"Nubra Summer Camp is really good with a beautiful campus with a stream, a small wooded region, and a flower/vegetable garden of its own. The tent was very good, big enough for 3 persons. Hot water was served in the morning. Toilet was big enough to take bath. The food served was hot and tasty. The staff was very courteous and helpful. Stroll around the stream and wooded regions in late evening and early morning for bird-sighting and wonderful views of the mountains.",Arun_Murthy_65a,/Profile/Arun_Murthy_65a,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",50

ladakh,"Enjoyed the scenic beauty, landscape and spacious tents most. Located in a sprawling orchard it brings you face to face with the natural environment of majestic Nubra Valley. In the rooms what I liked most was the interior space and big size washroom-cum-dressing area. The camp is located in the interior but that is the most attracting part of it. It provided good hospitality and quality food.  The staff can improve in terms of punctuality of services.  Overall a fantastic experience to be at Nubra Summer Camp. I would certainly recommend it to my friends.",Mahabir J,/Profile/MahabirJ3,,50
ladakh,"We visited Nubra summer camp on 24th May 2017. The most I liked is the location of the camp. Amidst the trees and mountains the location is prefect and serene.  The tents and bathrooms were clean. It was very cold outside but the quilts provided inside the tents were so warm.   The staff was very friendly. Due to long hault near Khardungla pass we reached campsite very late around 11:30pm but the staff was there to serve us food. And the food was delicious. In the morning we were served parathas which were tasty and we enjoyed our breakfast in the sunny morning.  We had a pleasant stay at the Nubra summer camp.  Thank you, Ambika",Ambi M,/Profile/AmbiM9,"Mumbai, India",50

ladakh,"We checked out many camps before finally checking in Nubra Summer Camp. Our driver told us to check out the camps before deciding to stay. It was indeed worth the effort. The tents were spacious & spotlessly clean, the premises very neatly planned & arranged & maintained. Best part is the calm atmosphere which we relished all night long. Since this camp was somewhat inside, it was far away from the hustle bustle of other crowded camps. They have a small sit out area in the gardens, which has perfect atmosphere for night revelleries. Best part is that you get booze just outside the camp, hardly 30 seconds walk. Food was homely & delicious, staff was very friendly & co-operative (even opened the doors at 2am, after they were asleep, since we were banging the doors :)).

ladakh,"This is newly started camp this season itself. I wnet through Dpauls to this camp. There are many camps at Hunder. So as a couple we were curios what kind of camp are we going to stay. But trust me as soon as we reached teh camp, I was soo shappy to see the quiet and nature beauty camp. And when I enetered the camp, I have never seen such a beautiful and well designed camp ever before in my life. Washrooms are also attached and with marble attached as well. In all camps were simply awsome. Alos the view were awsome. I t has river behind it.   The only problem was the quality of food. The food was average and not up to the mark. Else the camp stay and services were superbbb.",Archit G,/Profile/architg996,,30
