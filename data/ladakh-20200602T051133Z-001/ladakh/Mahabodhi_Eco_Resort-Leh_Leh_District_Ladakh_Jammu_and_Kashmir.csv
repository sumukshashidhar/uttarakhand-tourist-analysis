ladakh,"This is really a good place, incredibly peaceful and a wonderful place to meditate and relax. I would have given it 5 stars except that I got a lot of bites from some tiny flying insects (not mosquitoesâ€”in the US, we just call them no-see-ums) due to a lack of screens on the windows. It's not what I would call a budget place, but even though it's more than I would normally pay, I didn't mind because it goes for a great cause. What Bhikku Sanghasena has created there is truly amazing. And to be surrounded by such happy people (the monks, nuns, students, etc.) is part of what makes the stay so wonderful.",Peregrineri,/Profile/Peregrineri,"New Delhi, India",40

ladakh,"We stayed for 1 day and the stay was good. Owner arranged born fire for us in the night and the tea/snacks were very nice. This hotel is located at a highway location for leh so many a times if you pass by highways you can chose this hotel as it is a economical option with good snack/tea. Food is not preferable as the taste is average, else service is good and the arrangement made by the staff is really worth appreciation.",NamrataPriyani,/Profile/NamrataPriyani,,40
