ladakh,"Nous avons séjourné 5 nuits en 2 fois en septembre 2019. Nous avons apprécié l'accueil de nos hôtes, leur disponibilité et leur envie de nous apporter le meilleure service possible. Les chambres sont spacieuses, lumineuses et propres avec une grande salle de bains (avec eau chaude) attenante à la chambre. Cuisine excellente avec des légumes frais du jardin. Petit déjeuner copieux et varié. Pas de théière dans les chambres car l'excellent thé au gingembre était toujours disponible à tout heure de la journée. Une adresse à ne pas rater.",PMR,/Profile/LES_RICHARD_42,,50
ladakh,"It was my first time to Leh and before staying here i stayed at two other places during breaks between my travel and i must say this place is by far the best in terms of comfort,security,cleanliness and homely atmosphere. The owner Mr & Mrs Skalzang were very helpful with everything and made my stay in leh a very pleasant one.",Ion,/Profile/Ion0303,,50
ladakh,"This is my second stay at Gutur Guest House. I stayed here August 2018 and am here now (Sept 2019). It's everything you could want: large rooms with floor to ceiling windows, so very light; CLEAN; lovely garden with flowers to sit in; GOOD wifi; restaurant downstairs with the best food in Leh (no exaggeration); lots of tea; it's in an area away from the barking dogs in Leh so you get a good nights sleep.  Most importantly the owners are very welcoming and will do their best to help you: they can organise a trek/guide, taxi to/from the airport, bike hire. They are really quick to respond on whatsapp +91 96229 96524 if you have any questions.  It's also only a short walk to the main Leh market.",Alex F,/Profile/AlexLancaster2016,"Lancaster, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"I cant imagine a more better stay than ""the gutur"" in Leh. After staying in a very expensive hotel for the first initial days of my stay in leh due to the bad attitude of the staff, i decided to take a chance with Gutur guest house and it was just amazing and the best decision i took. The hospitality of the family along with the excellent dishes prepared by them gave me the much needed vacation and to top it all off the guest house is at waking distance to the leh market by around 15 mins only. The serene atmosphere and the spacious and very clean rooms will surely bring me to Gutur guest house only. Thanks for giving us such an amazing stay in Leh.",Sharath Mathew,/Profile/Mathew96,,50
ladakh,"I have stayed at this place twice with two of my friends in June 2016 and June 2019. It's amazing guest house thanks to the exceptional service by Mr and Mrs Stanzin. Both times they have gone out of the way to make our stay comfortable and memorable. The room and bathroom was  spotless. Amazing home cooked food and exceptional attention to everything that we needed. Will not hesitate to stay again here. As it was cold, ample blankets and room heater was provided. On the day if departure, we left the guest house at 0415 hrs and both wished us good bye and provided a take away breakfast. Hats off to their dedication and service. They are an example of some of the amazing people we have met during out bike trips to Ladakh. ",Gopal Tamboli,/Profile/Gops15,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",50
