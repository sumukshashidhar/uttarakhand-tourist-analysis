Indian food is awesome here  ,Delex Namgyal,/Profile/delexn2012,"Leh, India",50
ladakh,"This hotel is around 10 mins from Airport. We decided to make this as our base for our entire trip. And we felt nice that we did that. First thing you notice is the warm welcome from the staff. They are always on their toes for your needs. We were asking for warm water all the time in the room, and these guys never delayed or never forgot. Superb team. Food was good too. They always made sure that they put on the menu once good number of people are inside the dining hall so that everyone gets hot food. The non-veg food was awesome. The rooms were kept clean whenever we were out on trip and roaming. Very convenient check-in and check-out process. Hassle-free. The manager is all smiley and friendly guy.   Overall, its highly recommended hotel to stay in affordable rates. Be back",Kedar Mainkar,/Profile/bhatkyakedru,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"We stayed here for just one night. The rooms are very spacious. The food is good. Staff is courteous and polite, their service is quick. It's very near to Shanti Stupa and it's visible even from the ground floor of the hotel.",Himani R,/Profile/himanirana107,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"The hotel is 7-8 min drive from airport and a 15-20 min walk from main market.  The hotel is close to road unlike many other hotels.  The hotel staff is really cooperative. Special mention is Shahid at reception. Hotel staff guides you well for tours in and around city.  They don't show greed to book everything through them.  Rooms were spacious. Hot water available all time. Breakfast buffet was good.  Dinner buffet was ok sorts. It's better to take breakfast dinner included along with room booking,  in case you plan to eat two meals in hotel.  You may also bargain about the charges depending upon season and footfall of guests at hotel. One suggestion is clean uniform for lower staff.  ",Sapnasachin,/Profile/Sapnasachin,,50

ladakh,"As someone else also pointed out here, we too faced issues with the Manager. We were a group of bikers from the South and stayed here after recommendation from a close friend - ample parking, lovely open 1st floor terrace area and good rooms. Just when everything was going on good for us, we got a call from the manager at 8pm saying we need to have our dinner immediately - we politely refused but the calls kept coming. Only when our close friend called up Sonam the owner did the matter get resolved. Shanti Stupa is a great walk (hundreds of steps but u will love it), the area is peaceful and you can take ample walks around - its safe due to army cantonment near by. On the whole, we recommend this place (its closed now for winters) but make sure you handle the manager properly (i",Bike_Nomad_Kerala,/Profile/Bike_Nomad_Kerala,"Trivandrum, India",40
ladakh,"We had 3 different bookings in this hotel as we were to go inbetween to Nubra and Pangong and stay there for a night each. I booked this hotel based purely on suggestions of friends and reviews of Tripadvisor, however I ultimately booked it via GoIbibo, as I got a pretty good discount there.  The hotel itself is a lovely one. There is a first floor open terrace garden which offers lovely views of the surroundings. Though the hotel is understaffed, the staff is always there to help. There was this guy called KRISHNA who was simply amazing. He was always running here and there (Literally!) and there was always that smile on his face.  We never met the owner Mr Sonam during our entire stay, but we had all our interactions with the manager, a Mr Gopal. And that is where everything",Digantjhala,/Profile/Digantjhala,"Vadodara, India",30
ladakh,"Beautiful property ! Well maintained spacious rooms ! Good Staff !  Kudos to Mr Suman and his team for their arrangement from picking us from Airport to making all arrangement for our 7 days trip including vehicle and hotels at Nubra Valley and Pangong .

ladakh,"My wife and I planned a 7n/8d tour to Leh which had 5 nights stay in Leh through MMT in the last week of June 2017. Initially when I read reviews about this hotel, we were skeptical and requested MMT to change our hotel. They suggested that we should  go and check the place after landing  and if we did not like then they would change the hotel. Thank God for that suggestion as this hotel proved to be extremely nice and comfortable. It is situated at a walking distance from the famous tourist destination (Shanti Stupa) and a 10 – 15 mins walk to the main market.  The best part about this hotel are their staff. Their hospitality and the urge to serve their customers to make them feel comfortable was brilliant. Mr Gopal the manager was very helpful and welcomed  us with a garland.",GRaman86,/Profile/GRaman86,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,We have traveled along with 02 of my couple friends & stayed on the second floor rooms. It is situated on the main road leh city & very good clean rooms along with basic stuff provided in the rooms (Towels/Soaps/Hot water etc.). The biggest take away in staying in La Buddha is the staff & the hotel manager. All staff boys are very courteous & are keen to serve the tourists at any time of the day. Food is overall average & need an improvement.Overall a recommended place for your delightful stay in Leh City. Julley!! :),coolanujdel,/Profile/coolanujdel,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",50
ladakh,"The hotel was marked as a 3 start hotel and mentioned amenities like power backup and wifi. On my first day, I did not have electricity for about 8-9 hours and I was told that the generator would not be turned on for 1 room, since we were the only 2 people there who had booked a room at that hotel. There was no wifi connection for all the four days, though some poor connectivity was available for about 4 hours on one of the four days, that too was turned off intentionally when it was observed that only 2-3 rooms were booked on that day. The owner had no clue about the situation and was only trying to be defensive and at times, was trying to mince his words every few minutes in a shameless manner. The only good thing about the hotel, was the food. Overall, it is not a star hotel,",TarunMinocha,/Profile/TarunMinocha,"New Delhi, India",10

ladakh,"We have recently visited the LEH and stayed in this hotel for days. As we taken package from yatra and this is the hotel that they offer in their package (ladakh Panaroma) we thought it is going to be a good place.  But we were highly disappointed with the services offered by this hotel and staff.  ~ First of all manager of Hotel does not take any interest in listening and resolving customer issues, we have faced multiple issues in day1   ~ No hot water was made available for Drinking and not even in bath room  ~ No Kettle or room heater in room even not on demand, which are basic things considering tough weather conditions ~ TV not working (channels not coming)  ~ Almost cold food is served no one cares ~ Even tea and coffee are not real hot as required",Vaibhav T,/Profile/323vaibhavt,,20

ladakh,This newly built hotel is located away from the hustle and bustle of city center. The hotel offers rooms to Armed Forces personnel at discounted rates and is very popular among them. The hospitality is superlative and the managers were more than willing to go that extra mile to make you comfortable and special occasions memorable. We got some unique flowers on our anniversary.  There is one restaurant which offers  nice Indian food at reasonable prices and even at odd times. There are many books available.  Though the hotel does not have a travel desk the mangers were very helpful in arranging excellent sightseeing at very reasonable prices.,Dr Mahendra N Mishra,/Profile/mnmishra,"New Delhi, India",40

A very nice courtyard with chairs and sceneries compelled us to eat out sometimes. The food at the mess is quite nice. It felt like we were at a wedding. Absolutely delicious dishes. The hotel staff is pleasing . Sits with you to learn about your travel itenaries , meal preferences and even got the wifi routers closer to our rooms In a span of 4-5 days it felt like home.
