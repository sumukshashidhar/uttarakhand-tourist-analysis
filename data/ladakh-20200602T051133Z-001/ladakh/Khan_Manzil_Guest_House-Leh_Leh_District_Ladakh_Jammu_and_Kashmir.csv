ladakh,"I really liked this hotel. Clean, comfortable, delicious breakfasts at a low price, great location in the city center. The hotel has rooms with a shared bathroom and rooms with a shower inside. In the hotel you can leave some of the luggage for storage for the duration of the trekking.",Alex Lee,/Profile/dukus2015,"St. Petersburg, Russia",50
ladakh,We were 7 friends and had booked 2 rooms at dirt cheap price over phone. The owner was a family person who had arranged everything for us starting from bikes.vehicle and guiding us where can we find cheap food. The rooms are OK type with uninterrupted running hot water. The owner is always at your service. It is walkable distance from the German bakery and the main market. If you are on a budget this guest house is the best taking into account everything. We stayed for 4 nights in the same guest house as we started loving the hospitality. ,jitendra r,/Profile/479jitendrar,"Bhubaneswar, India",40
ladakh,"My boyfriend and I arrived here after a rather long and tortuous journey between manali and Leh and as travellers we aren‚Äôt particularly fussy about rooms just as long as they are clean which this definitely was not, among other things.   Arriving at 1am which I had already informed the owner of our late arrival we tried ringing from the car that had brought us and he picked up and then hung up and didn‚Äôt answer again so we couldn‚Äôt find the place for quite a while meaning an even later arrival when we had been travelling for 20 hours +. When we finally found the place and woke someone up we were firstly offered a dindgy drab looking room that the sheets were dirty and stained and everything was dirty and looked as though it was falling apart - curtains, floor.

ladakh,"I had stayed at Khan Manzil Guest House during my Leh trip in July, 2016. Though being a peak season, we were surprised to get rooms at such cheap price. Plus it is situated at a good location; within walking distance to market. Special mention have to be made about our host. He was a kind and caring fellow and also helped us out with our itinerary. You can leave your bags while travelling to Nubra without any tension and come back and stay at the same place. I am pretty sure the next time I visit Leh, this is where I will be staying again!",903solitarywanderer,/Profile/903solitarywanderer,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Khan Manzil is a great place where to stay in Leh. I visited the place in July. I faced health issues when in Ladakh and the manager was of incredible help. He was sincerely caring about me and made sure to make my life easier all the time (including transportation etc).  During my time at the hospital, he even came to visit me at the hospital to make sure I was fine. He always provided great pieces of advice during my stay at Khan Manzil and before that he was very helpful in arranging a trip (literally everything: guide, transportation etc.) at the best conditions possible. Thus, I would like to address again a GREAT THANK YOU to the Khan Manzil team for everything they did for me. Finally, the guest house offers a very pleasant rooftop terrace with a great view on the valley",Matthieu C,/Profile/288MatthieuC,"Paris, France",50

ladakh,"We were booked here for two nights but extended to a week. The beds were slightly hard and the wifi and electricity were unreliable (as it is city wide) but the owners were friendly and attentive, the views from the roof top were beautiful, the food provided was good, the price was good, and the location was superb.",Jessica O,/Profile/598jessicao,"London, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"Centrally located in the city center, we check in early at 7am without problem. Room attached bathroom is big, hot water shower without problem and wifi signal is the strongest and very fast comparing with other guesthouse and restaurants in Leh. The staff and boss are kind and helpful. Breakfast is nice too. The rooftop with the mountain view is great. Overall with this price and location, it is really valuable in Leh. Recommended!!",tofudon,/Profile/tofudon,Hong Kong,50
ladakh,"We stayed here for 5 nights in June and the stay was awesome. Zaheer bhai, the owner and Ismail bhai, the caretaker are both superbug helpful. We arrived a day prior to our booked stay at 11pm but they didn't cause any trouble and gave us a room. It's a nice cosy place for people looking for a cheap and comfortable stay in the city centre.",Antarik Anwesan,/Profile/antarika,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"I took break from work and wanted to explore some clam and quite places, one of my friends suggested me to visit Ladak, as she was working on some research on Ladak, she knew about the place well. So I booked my flight Bangalore to Delhi and Delhi to Leh. When I asked her suggestion for hotel accommodation she introduced me Khan Manzil, Booked this place over phone call. As I was going to stay for long duration 12 days tariff was suitable for me.  When I arrived Leh from Airport took prepaid cab and reached guest house. Guest house has good location its small place but have good room with carpet, clean sheets, running cold and hot water, and a tv with cable.  Best thing about this place is it has proximity to market and you can find many food points or restaurants nearby, as",ManojDangoria,/Profile/ManojDangoria,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,"Guesthouse itself is alright: hot shower, nice terrace, large but cold rooms..It was quite, close to the restaurants in Leh and prices were pretty affordable in October.   What I really liked is the manager who lives there. His English is very good, and he helped us a lot with our 1-2 day trips. Each time, we came back to the guesthouse, where we left our bags, rejuvenate and prepare for the next trip. Also, when we came down with AMS, the managers family helped us out.

ladakh,"This was my 2nd time stayed in Khan Manzil Guest House. The owner and family are always so family-like that makes here really like home away from home. The location is very good, at a quiet alley in main bazaar very close to the restaurants and shops. The room is clean and cozy and they just changed new hot water system that in this high altitude place they have hot water and good water pressure all day long which is really grateful. Leh is a very beautiful place worth to stay longer and enjoy the life here. Will definitely go back and stay here again.",mavis,/Profile/cjmavis,Asia,50
ladakh,"I stayed here for 4 nights. It's a decent place, but you can get better for the same price. The people that work there are nice and friendly, except for the owner (the son of the old friendly fellow). Don't expect him to help or advise you with arranging permits etc. Something that happens in most other guesthouses in Leh. View from the rooftop terrace is nice. But overall I won't recommend this place to other travelers. ",Nicolas_NL,/Profile/Nicolas_NL,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",20
ladakh,its a very nice homely and comfortable place. staff was really courteous and helpful. really enjoyed our stay. It  is located right in the middle of Leh town with easy access to restaurants and taxis. The manager even agreed not to charge me for one day (which I decided to spend in Nubra) although I had already done an online booking for it. Service and breakfast really good but dont expect five star pampering.,nilanjal,/Profile/nilanjal,"Mumbai, India",50

We had already made our booking online(Hostelworld.com) from 20th to 23rd and for 25th, but we arrived two days late as we got stuck on our way to Leh due to bad weather and landslides. But the hosts Mr. Khan & his father were very accommodating even after the delay. They didn't even charge us for the previous days and didn't even rent the rooms to someone else. The rooms were clean and simple, just what a traveler on budget wants. They also arranged rooms for the days we had not made a booking online. They even arranged a taxi for us to Nubra at a discounted price and even helped us out in choosing the right pashmina shawl. Overall they were very gracious and accommodating.

ladakh,I stayed here for about 10 days during June 2015 . The owner Mr. Zaheer and his family are amongst the most friendly people you can come across and will help you out in planning the travel schedules while in Ladakh. The rooms are quite  nice especially keeping in mind the price and hot water facility is available throughout the day (a plus in ladakh). The terrace has stunning views of the snow capped mountain ranges and is a nice place to relax. Overall highly recommended especially for the hospitality! ,Shankar R,/Profile/78shankarr,,50
ladakh,There is not much to say about the rooms. They are simple but clean just as you demand it as an european tourist. But the service of the family run guest house is perfectly wonderful. At first we were received with a tea and all informations you need for a pleasant acclimatisation. We arrived with our mountainbikes for a very unusal trip in the Mountains and got all assistance and support you can ask for. They even storaged steady our really big bags for about two weeks for free.Whenever I'll come to Leh-this will be the place I have to be!,KaiT1972,/Profile/KaiT1972,"Lund, Sweden",50
ladakh,I stayed at khan manzil twice. Once in June  2008 and once in 2009 June. The hotel offers budget accommodation and is centrally located.   Advantages.   - value for money - hot water available  - reasonably clean - centrally located  - locality has lot of bakers preparing great wheat bread - view of the fort is awesome at night.   Disadvantages   - small rooms  - congested.  - food and other services are very average  - may not be very suitable for families  - car parking internet other digital services not available  All and all its a nice place for boy groups to stay. We enjoyed our stay here as we went there during college days and didn't care much about ambience and stuff and it fit in out budget. ,vinay n,/Profile/287vinayn,,30

He speaks good English and is very honest and sincere. He organised all our trips - Nubra valley, Lamayuru, Panggong Lake & around Leh. His price was definitely the cheapest in town. He gave us 20% discount for all the trips which was a great savings to us. When compared to outside travel agent's price, Mr. Zaheer's price was indeed the cheapest.

After an 18 hour layover in Delhi airport, we were absolutely exhausted by the time we arrived at 8 am, but the owner let us check in early free of charge. The owners were really friendly and helpful, provided us with information and suggestions, extra blankets for the cold October nights, and candles for the power cuts. The room was basic but clean, quite big and completely adequate. The view of the mountains from the rooftop, which was where our room was, was very beautiful and the little flower pots on the rooftop were a nice touch.

Also prepare breakfast for us on the way to Pangong in which we can say, the way they prepare breakfast for us is professional and with their heart.
