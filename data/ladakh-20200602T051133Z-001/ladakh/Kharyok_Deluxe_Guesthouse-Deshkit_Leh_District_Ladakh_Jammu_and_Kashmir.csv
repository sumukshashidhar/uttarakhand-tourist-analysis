ladakh,"The rooms are not the best, need to cleaner. Walked in and the furniture seemed shabby and dirty. Bedsheets were not clean either. After a long tiring day we were ready to crash and turned off the lights to fall asleep but right outside our room was a huge green light that would hit us on the face and could not be turned off. This place is so-so !",shinybutter,/Profile/shinybutter,"Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,"Nice, clean rooms with lovely garden outside. stayed there twice in July 2015 and July 2016.\ Loved it. Owner is very humble and cooperative, always has smile on his face. Food is testy and mainly north Indian food available.",Vishal V,/Profile/VishalV477,,50
ladakh,Rooms on the ground floor were just OK and those at the top floor was good. They provided thick blankets to protect from cold during night which was very nice. The stay was very cost effective and food was also OK considering the location. around 6Kms from Hunder dunes and 2min drive from Diskit monastery. A nice place to stay at Diskit.,SkandaTS,/Profile/SkandaTS,"Bengaluru, India",40
