ladakh,"Me and my family stayed at hotel Horzay for good one week, and I would say that I felt it was home away from home for us. The hostess is an extremely helpful lady who always went out of her way to make our stay very comfortable. Whether we needed information about the good shopping outlets, eateries and places to see, she was more than happy to guide us with all the information along with the hand drawn maps to help us find our way around the city. We only ate breakfast at the hotel (as we were out sightseeing the rest of the day each day), and the breakfast was a delight as the hostess herself served it hot with a warm smile, making sure that her guests were well looked after and were served what they wanted.  It felt like a comfy homestay with hospitality par excellence. I",Tanuja Sodhi,/Profile/TanujaSodhi,,50
ladakh,"Though booked on a fixed, non refundable basis via b.com, the room has been given away to another guest before six p.m. This is a clear attempt of cheating, and in lack of fat alternatives, we ended up in a cellar like room with moisty bed linen and cell phoning Indian guests in front of the door - and still had to pay the full room fare. The entrance door is guarded by two lazy, growling dogs, who wouldn't let you pass without the owners intervention, and on top, they keep you awake during the night with their endless barking. Also be aware that the hotel is small and is about being enclosed by a tower tall new building on the main road side.",stargarten,/Profile/stargarten,"Berlin, Germany",10
ladakh,We stayed here for 3 nights. Neat and clean rooms. Friendly people and tasty breakfast. Rooms have heaters. They helped us getting our permits.   Walkable to Leh market. Would suggest this place for stay in Leh. ,Vinodkrao,/Profile/Vinodkrao,,50
ladakh,I had booked my stay at this hotel in Sept 2017 on my visit to Leh for 6th edition of Ladakh Marathon. I was amazed by the quality of service. Special thanks to Ms Rubina and her staff who went out of their  way to make my stay comfortable. The room was clean and very comfortable. The complimentary breakfast was lip smacking and over all food was of the highest quality. Ms Rubina also provided excellent guidance on the places I can visit in Ladakh. I had a memorable stay. Hoping to come again to this hotel when I come to participate in 7th edition of Ladakh marathon . ,Abhinav G,/Profile/AbhinavG357,,50
ladakh,"We had a beautiful, homely stay at this hotel. it was a hectic trip we had, however, this place was very homely and comforting. the rooms are large, very clean and had all the basic necessities required. The food here was good quality and well prepared. Rubina the manager was very helpful and went beyond her call of duty to advise and extend her help.",Sudeepa_Basu,/Profile/Sudeepa_Basu,New Delhi,50
ladakh,"We were there in September 2016.  The manager, a charming young girl called Rubina called me the previous evening to inform that the road leading to the hotel is under repair and our rooms (2) are in the second floor and the hotel doesn't have an elevator.  Was mildly surprised with this information because I booked the place sometime in early July.  Landed at Leh to find complementary transport from the hotel waiting.  Once checked in Rubina really took good care of us.  The rooms are remarkably spacious and clean and are generally well maintained. No. 206 on the 1st floor is probably the best.  Nothing much to write about the views, average at the best.  Rubina has excellent knowledge about the tourist circuit and she arranged for our transport to Nubra and Pang gong tao lake.",Sumanta RoyChowdhury,/Profile/SumantaRoyChowdhury,"Kolkata, India",50
ladakh,"The hotel was recommended by Booking but it was 2-3 times more expensive than similar guest houses in different location up of the Main Market. I had a very good care during the first days of adaptation and I am grateful for that. The manager acted as a travel agent and this service, unfortunately, was dissapointing (lack of permit which other agent arranged and a very old and uncomfortable car for 12 hours trip to monasteries).",19Jola57,/Profile/19Jola57,"Krakow, Poland",30
ladakh,"Stayed for six nights with a Trek in between.  This is a family run business. All members of the family are friendly and show a genuine concern for the well-being of guests. The personal touch is applied to everything. All reasonable requests are dealt with efficiently. They really will go out of their way to help you!  The staff particulary Rubina and her mother will offer reliable informative local advice on shopping,restaurants and tours in and around Leh.   The Hotel is clean and comfortable and has easy access to shops, reataurants and the main bazaar. It represents great value for money and you get a level of personal service that is really hard to find even in high end 5star hotels.  Have no hesitation in highly recommending this Hotel which is a hidden gem!",WilliamB47,/Profile/WilliamB47,"Hong Kong, China",50
ladakh,"The kind of place you're delighted to come back to after a day enjoying the spectacular scenery of Ladakh. Rubina and her family have created something wonderful here and a large part of that is down to the personal service on offer. As far as I could see, you're unlikely to find a better option in Leh.",garyreilly147,/Profile/garyreilly147,"Dublin, Ireland",50
ladakh,"This is a lovely hotel run by an incredibly sweet family. It is in a convenient location, not far from the shops and the center. The rooms are spacious and clean, and albeit not modern, they have a lot of charm! But what won our hearts over is the service and the family-like reception. We were treated with the best hospitality I have ever experienced! Wonderful breakfast, useful traveling tips, and always helpful. On top of that, when I forgot my phone in the hotel, the owners found a way to send it back to me through Delhi. If I ever go back to Leh (which I am planning to), I am going straight to Hotel Horzay! Home away from home indeed:)",tetshev,/Profile/tetshev,"Frankfurt, Germany",50
ladakh,"Clean, neat,comfortable, cozy rooms....above all this place becomes special because of the owners. Rubina and her mom, takes care of the guests so well, that you feel like an extended family member.When I stayed there, a guest fell sick late in the night.... Rubina took her personally to the hospital , stayed with her till she was stable and got her back after she was fine. She had made all arrangements for our stay in Pangong and nubra. We had a great time at Horzay and will visit again soon.....thank you Rubina.....",Jaggernut,/Profile/Jaggernut,,50

ladakh,"I must first say that this has been the most warm and inviting place I have ever been to in my life. Hotel Horzay is located in the Leh city itself very close to the market. The owner Rubina and family made our stay comfortable and convenient at the same time. Rubina arranged for all our bikes, stay at Nubra and Pangong and was kind enough to bargain on our behalf.Her mother does the cooking herself and what a delight it was. This is clearly the best hotel I have stayed in as far as the overall experience goes. The whole itenary was planned with Rubina's help and we guys had a ball of a time that we intended to have. Jeevan and the guys were smiling throughout and were a great help.Thanks Rubina and family.Julley",Vinay2405,/Profile/Vinay2405,"Nashik, India",50

ladakh,"You would be wondering what does the word ""Julley"" means, well it simply means hello or a thank u in the local language!! And about horzay, what can I say it's difficult to describe in words, we all go for travelling and stay at hotels, some really big some a little small, some are gud some are not so gud, but whatever the experience, we always miss one thing that's our home and the food that we get at home. Well here was this place where I felt at home, a place like no other I have visited before and I guess would not get to visit again in my life... The people who run this place don't consider it as their business and people as guests, they treat you as a family members and look after you like a family does.

ladakh,"This is one of the best hotel I have stayed till now(visited on June 2015). It is near Old Leh Road, very close to the market area( Tibetan Market). The hostess was very helpful to us each and every moment we spent there. They are very caring.  The rooms are very spacious, well decorated and clean.   FREE WIFI!  The food tasted very good(Don't miss French Omelette). The dining area is very large and clean. They even have an open-area dining space, were you can pass the evening.  Free fresh drinking water(though Water Purifier would be appreciated)  I strongly recommend this place.",Rihel B,/Profile/rihelb,"Kolkata, India",50
ladakh,"I stayed 5 nights at the Horzay, which is located close to the market and Main Bazarr. The rooms were large and clean. Ms Rubina and her staff did everything they could to make my trip go  well.. My deepest and most sincere appreciation.   They arranged my Inner Line and ECO permit, even though I was a lone travel, with a Leh rented Royal Enfield. They arranged airport pickup and drop off; local taxi trips while I waited for the bike, and were a great help making arrangements when the airline canceled my return flight and the revised flight schedule was not clearly rescheduled.  I stayed on the top floor and went to roof first thing each morning for weather look. See attached photos from roof, just beautiful.  Breakfeast was available in room or dining, Dinner was available when",James R,/Profile/jamesrW9980YM,,50
ladakh,"This a new hotel off Old Leh Road, very close to the market area and yet tucked away from the hustle bustle of the market as it is slightly on the inside. The rooms are very spacious, well lit and clean. They have dedicated staff who enquire and service your every need.  Kudos to the folks who run the place. They are very helpful. On an occasion, when my wife was unwell, they even took us to the doctor instead of directing us to one.  The food tasted amazing. The dining area is not fancy but very neat and tidy. This was one of the very few places where the kitchen did not have a ""No Admission"" board. We could walk in to the kitchen, it was clean and the food was prepared very hygienically. I would give a No. 10 for the Gobi Parathas :-) .  I strongly recommend this place.",challa93,/Profile/challa93,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,This is one of the oldest hotel of leh situated in a quite lane covered with trees all around. The view of snow peak of stok from the terrace is breath taking. Beautiful courtyard with streams running across the compound. Cosy rooms with beautiful view. The best thing about this place are the people here. They are the most amazing people you will come across. And not to forget the awesome home cooked food here. We had a awesome time. We will be back soon.,iambrahma,/Profile/iambrahma,,50
ladakh,This one is the best hotel i have seen so far. We visited Leh last year that is August-2014. We already had booked another hotel in Leh but due to our co-ordinator in Kashmir we faced some problems there to get the rooms. So we cancelled the booking there and our driver took us to Hotel Horzey. When we checked the Hotel Horzey we all liked the hotel and their way of responding to coustmers and we immediately moved to this hotel.   I am not sure if hotel owner does remeber us or not. But i would like to give a hint to them that there was an tv actress with us whose name was Khushbu.  Very nice and would love to go again...Kudos for the Hotel horzey...:),SuryaDhakray,/Profile/SuryaDhakray,"Mumbai, India",50
