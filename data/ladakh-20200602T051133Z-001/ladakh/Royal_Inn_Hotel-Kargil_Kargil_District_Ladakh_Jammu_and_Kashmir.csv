ladakh,"Was on a motorbike trip and spent one night there. Received a warm welcome by the manager. Was tired and asked for dinner - the kitchen surprised with a variety of different dishes, all well prepared and tasty. Rooms clean and sufficient amount of warm water. WIFI and TV. The hotel is located on a river, a little bit outside the city center and is not so loud. Asked for the preparation of lunch packs for my group for the next day and got yummy sandwiches and fruits. Management tries to meet all customers needs - a clear recommendation for staying there before going on to Rangdum. Was there a second time after coming back from Rangdum.",enrico f,/Profile/enricof536,,40
ladakh,"Had a lovely stay in the hotel. The manager was very polite, friendly and extremely helpful. So was the staff. Location is excellent, with a beautiful view of the river Suru. It is located right on the river bank, and at night, one can hear the sound of the river flowing. Very serene experience. Food was simple, tasty and wholesome. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay there.",Rajeev J,/Profile/GlobeTrotting222785,"Pune, India",40
ladakh,"We arrived at this hotel at 1.45 pm and there was absolutely no-one about except a fellow traveller, who informed us the manager would be back in a bit. We were given a room that had leaking plumbing and no natural sunshine. It required us to ask for extra towels so we could go into bathroom safely. The room was not clean in fact during the night I discovered an item of woman's underwear in the sheets with us that did not belong to me!!! As far as we could make out Kargil itself is a very uninteresting town tourist wise. Besides the above criticism the manager was a very likeable chap even though he got distracted very easily.",Jenny3284,/Profile/Jenny3284,"Port Fairy, Australia",10
