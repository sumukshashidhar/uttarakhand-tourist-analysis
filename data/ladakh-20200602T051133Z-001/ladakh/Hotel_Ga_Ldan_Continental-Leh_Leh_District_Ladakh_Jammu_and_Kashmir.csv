ladakh,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED . Hotel Ga-ldan continental is located on junction of old fort road. Location itself is the biggest plus point of this hotel, everything like main market, taxi stand, and best restaurants in leh like gesmo German bakery, lamayuru, chopsticks and all are just 2/3 mins walk from here. There is a super market attached, that makes life very easy. The hotel has a very airy layout, as all rooms face the centrally located garden, we could even view leh fort every time we opened the room door. The hotel building seems very old but still is well maintained, rooms are spacious and linen was clean but we had to live with leaking tap and falling wardrobe door. Tv and settop box had cables running everywhere which can be dangerous if you have kids. Electricity and Wifi is",jeetu b,/Profile/254jeetub,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,So this place will win your hearts with their great service and apple orchids in the hotel itself. The greenery inside the hotel is very peacefull. The close proximity to markets and places are a great plus point. The staff is very good and Mr. Stazin was a great help to us. ,BHAVESH B,/Profile/Bhaveshbhati,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"Staff is polite and helpful, but hotel facilities are rather dated. Bedroom is huge. Bathroom furnishings are quite run down, with leaky/loose tap fittings. Located within city areas makes it accessible. ",hyeel,/Profile/hyeel,"New York City, New York",30
ladakh,"Hotel Ga-Ldan Continental is a good place to stay at Leh. The location of the hotel itself has an advantage, as it is very near to Main Bazaar. Near to the hotel that is the fort Road is quite crowded and all kind of shops are their. Rooms are well maintained ,comforting and even offered the mini luxury of chairs and sofas to sit on. Foods are delicious. View from upstairs is awesome. Rooms are big and WiFi is good but to be improved. The Room,Toilet,Corridors is very neat and clean. Bedsheets, pillow covers, towels were changed everyday. We got a triple bed room with breakfast in Rs2000/day. The interior decor is good, the rooms are spacious and warm. There is a small garden in the middle, where you can sit to have your breakfast or evening tea. Hotel is having hot water",Republic_Of_Travel,/Profile/Republic_Of_Travel,"Kolkata, India",40
ladakh,I really liked the behaviour of the staff as they were very friendly and also the market area where it was located. The hotel arranged a vehicle for our sightseeing at reasonable rates and the food was also considerably good.,tanwanisunil,/Profile/tanwanisunil,"Pune, India",30

ladakh,"We stayed here for one night for rest and local shopping after our packaged tour ended. The room rate was very cheap and we really did not expect much for the price. But we were very impressed.  Location: +Right in the middle of Leh Market. Very good for trying local food and buying local things. +Nice view of market from our room (not all rooms in the hotel have them). +Nice view of Stanti Stupa, Leh Palace and the Himalayas from the rooftop.  +Nice spacious and well decorated courtyard inside.  Room: +Nice and spacious for 3 (we stayed in a triple bedded standard room). +Neat and clean linen and towels. +Has everything that a costly hotel has â€“ phone, room service, TV, cupboard, etc.  Food: NA since we did not have any food here. Service: +We arrived here directly and did not",Deba_Nandy,/Profile/Deba_Nandy,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,I visited 3 hotels before finalizing on this one to stay for 4 nights.All the hotel had almost similar ambience and rooms but expensive than this one. Ga-ldan has decent rooms at affordable price. We stayed in a suite as we all wanted to stay together. We were a group of 7 people. Food was very tasty better than some of the restaurants nearby.,Neal Patel,/Profile/neilayy,"Irving, Texas",40
ladakh,"While watching the facade and the woodwork on windows, we thought this hotel must be over our budget but as they say ""poochhne mein kya jaata hai?"" (whats the harm in asking), we went inside and inquired about availability and price.   The price was a steal, so we didn't even bothered to check any other property and booked immediately lest someone else should take this room. The rooms were cozy and bathroom was clean. The staff was courteous and responsive. Our non-working DTH was replaced immediately with the working one.  I found no flaw from check-in to stay to check out.  Electricity supply is a problem in leh, so you have to live with it.  Recommended for visitors",banerjeeamit,/Profile/banerjeeamit,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,This hotel in the heart of Leh city doesnt have a very impressive facade but once you are in it you will like it. The owner himself takes care of his guests and teh staff too are very courteous. There is good supply of running hot water. Linen is crisp clean and the rooms though dont offer any great view are sunny and clean. Food is good esp if a la carte. The location makes it very convenient to go anywhere from there. Loved my stay there.,Mahua-CCU,/Profile/Mahua-CCU,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"Centrally located in Leh city, this hotel is quite reasonable (About Rs. 1600 for a double room) and excellent service. Only inconvenience is that if you need to have lunch/dinner you might have to order it a couple of hours before and they have displayed this message in the reception to avoid confusion to visitors.",itsindia,/Profile/itsindia,India,40
