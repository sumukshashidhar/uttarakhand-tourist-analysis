ladakh,Ladakh Summer Camp is situated within 1 km of the desert safari in sand dunes. The camp is well maintained and have good open space. They have a beautiful flower section which attracts everyone.  The food is bad. We didn't eat anything for dinner. It is better to carry some maggi instead.,Kaivan,/Profile/kaivan03,,30

ladakh,"We visited Nubra as family group, stayed at the Hotel for 1 night. The camps are comfortable. Hot water is available for limited time. There is electricity problem at night. However it seems to be the problem in whole area. Food available is good. Staff service was good. Overall it was good experience.",HemantBh,/Profile/HemantBh,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,Good things:  Neat and clean Sanju is good in nature who unfortunately report to caretaker  Bad things. 1. Care taker misbehaving. 2. Hot water available only in morning. If you ask it latter Lotus will get angry. 3. No security in night as it is near jungle. In night wild dog entering camps. 4 some camps are not fully chained has openings at bottom so animal can entered. One dog entered camp and torn our bag.  5. Care taker is rude about this.,prakhar g,/Profile/prakharg68,,30
ladakh,A very nice and clean camp located beautifully. Though the area lacked network coverage but who cares when you want to be in with Nature. The staff was very polite and food was great specially the breakfast. Camp is close to the sand dunes (just 5 mins ride) and you can take a long walk in and around the camp as well. Overall a very pleasant experience.,ankur k,/Profile/659ankurk,,50
ladakh,"We arrive there around 4 pm . First we are bit confuse between nubra summer camp and ladakh summer camp , Please don't forget there are two summer camp in same area . But ladakh summer camp is very near to sand dune desert , its only 10 to 12 minutes walking distance . There are lots of option in nubra but we are not wrong to choose ladakh summer camp its a perfect camp with all the luxury needs and their food is Delicious , service excellent .",kritika s,/Profile/kritikas214,,50

ladakh,"This camp stay added exquisite memories to our Leh trip. Surrounded by mountains from all sides , the camp gives a feels  of wilderness but once you enter the camps luxury awaits . Imitating the Swiss camp designs, the camp has all more than necessary items and services needed for a relaxed stay. The staff is well trained , friendly and professional at the same time. Sanjay, the camp manager is extremely polite and goes out of his way to make your stay memorable.  location wise, the camp is 20 mins walk from the Hunder sand-dunes where you can enjoy the double hump camel ride and the serene sunset. If I ever visit Nubra valley again , there is no other place I would want to stay at!",aditi d,/Profile/507aditid,"Pune, India",50

ladakh,"Ladakh summer camps are tent camps located in hundar at nubra valley. The camp consists of good staff- friendly and cooperative. The tents are spacious and clean . The location is picturesque with desert in the nubra valley.. and simultaneous view of the snow clad mountains - a beautiful contrast. The food was good, we were provided delicious jain food, and they willingly try to cater to our food needs. They claim to have free wifi service, but during our stay we coulsnt avail it as the system was down. They have facility and arrangement for camp fire with good music in evenings. Do not miss the sand dunes and turtuk the last Indian village accessible by civilians.. pakistan is just 5km away from turtuk. ",Avani S,/Profile/AvaniS92,,50
ladakh,"This place is in the interiors of Nubra Valley surrounded with mountains. Beautiful view, very peaceful, calm, clean and amazing. Staff is also very understanding, supportive and very good.

It was an amazing stay there... thank you Sonamji.",yesha d,/Profile/yeshad7,"Mumbai, India",50
