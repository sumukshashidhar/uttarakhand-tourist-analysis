ladakh,It gets very cold in winters in Leh. This hotel provided us with comfortable stay and decent food. Hotel is close to airport and market area. There was 24/7 running water and heated rooms. Staff is helpful and courteous.,Parshav J,/Profile/parshavj2017,,50
ladakh,"10 odd minutes from the airport, very close to the main bazaar.  Luxurious rooms, Kama toiletries, in-room heating.  The food on the first day wasnt the best, but rest of the five meals were great. Staff is even better.  Danish, Abid and Viren were warm and helpful (one of us needed an oxygen cylinder and a doctor early morning)",DrPreet,/Profile/DrPreetDeepSingh,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"The hotel is in a central location in Leh. The market & restaurants are within walking distance. The hotel is very neat & clean, the staffs are very courteous and rooms are very spacious. However, the hotel is overpriced compared to the services. There is not much option in the breakfast menu.  ",_sengaurab75,/Profile/_sengaurab75,"Kolkata, India",30
ladakh,"I spent several nights during my vacations in Ladakh at this hotel. The structure is really new and very clean, room spacious and bed comfortable. Unfortunately the place is full of loud Indian people and we couldn't barely sleep and rest. The food was good, but the staff is a bit unprepared, although very thoughtful and kind. Maybe they should speed up a bit but they are generally ok. Nevertheless the price paid is too high for the standard offered. So they should either raise the standard (staff preparation and general organization, which sometimes brought to very long delay at dinner time) or low a bit the prices.",Chiara L,/Profile/562chiaral,,20
ladakh,"We were a group of ladies and we’ve stayed here for four nights. Breakfast was inclusive and delicious. Abeer would look after the service in the breakfast hall, he along with other staff were very good. Rest meals we would end up having outside.  Rooms were very clean and spacious. This hotel is 5 mins walking distance to the main eating and shopping areas. Courteous and helpful staff. Will definitely recommend this hotel. ",akshada78,/Profile/akshada78,"Panjim, India",50
ladakh,"As we entered the reception, we were sure this would be a clean and nice hotel as the pictures online indicate. However, when we entered the room, we were proven wrong; it was full of small insects, the bathroom looked unfinished, and everything except the bed was dirty. We were there for 15 minutes before we decided to find something else even though we had a reservation. It looks much better at first glance than it actually is, and it is way overpriced. In Leh, you can find much better hotels at cheaper prices.",Anne,/Profile/407annea,"Copenhagen, Denmark",20
ladakh,"Extremely expensive with the service standards of a one star hotel. We called the desk to ask for ice, room service, even toilet paper when we ran out. Nobody ever came to respond to any of these calls. We called for ice 3 times. The work ethic of the staff was appalling. They just do not care. Breakfast was free but terrible quality. The rooms are clean and beds are comfortable but the fridge and the aircon did not work in our room. Hundreds of dollars wasted when we would’ve had friendlier and more competent service at a backpacker hostel. Do not choose to stay here. ",Siobhan,/Profile/siobhan158158,,10
ladakh,"This is a very nicely built and decorated hotel. The moment you enter, you experience the plush and luxurious decor. Even though our stay was good , we were not really happy with the breakfast because of limited options and food was not really great. The hotel is exorbitant given that the property is the only positive, food and overall service is not that great. Staff seems to be indifferent at times, but then you won’t experience that much if you’re planning to spend your time outdoors. Our stay was comfortable and peaceful and we were fairly satisfied with the amenities provided in our room. I believe if service improves and food options are looked into , this can be a great place to stay.",Navneet,/Profile/Nashthetraveller,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,Real nice facility. No great facility can make up for a 800-900 Rupee tadka-daal or  momos or 1000 rupee mixed veggies dish. I am not sure what this hotel owners are thinking. These prices aren’t found even in seven star hotels in a delhi or Mumbai or in remotest of places in India. Especially when there are so many great places to eat in Leh that provide amazing food at very reasonable prices. It’s a new facility and they gave us their nice room with two double beds for three of us but still no match for Ladakh residency we also stayed at in the same trip where a suite was provided for the three of us with a lot more space. Breakfast is very nice but usually not ready on time. Expect delays of half an hour so plan your checkout and onwards journey start times accordingly.

ladakh,"This hotel was very nice. Very friendly staff at the reception desk and also in the restaurant. Everything was clean, rooms spacious and lovely. They have a great chef and nice food. Perhaps the restaurant was a little bit too pricey or so it seemed to me for a European. The breakfasts were good but could be more variety of breads and food. The wifi was not working 80% of the time. Still from what I have seen it is one of the best in Leh and I would recommend it to everyone.",570petra,/Profile/570petra,"Prague, Czech Republic",40
ladakh,"Booked this hotel for 2 days in the month of july 2019. This is a pricey hotel but overall infrastructure and rooms are pretty nice. A. The Room Booked the premiere room for our stay which has room with balcony and bathtub. Room is beautiful but there is no provision for regulating the room temp. It felt really hot inside during day time so the hoteliers provided us a table fan. Other options available are classic room and royal suites. Hotel staff is very courteous and very prompt to solve any problem  B. The hotel Being a 5 star i expected they must be having spa and gym, but they don't have both. So that was a disappointment Food is tasty and breakfast buffet delicious.  ",Dr Tausif Iqbal,/Profile/iqtausif,"New Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"A beautiful property with well designed, spacious and luxurious rooms , lovely bathrooms and great temperature control. The owners are on top of everything and that’s a plus . Staff are hospitable and impressive. We had a lovely stay as a family and we were made to feel at home especially by the f&b team. ",MARILYN G,/Profile/marilyng206,"Sangolda, India",50
ladakh,"We stopped by Indus Valley as we were extremely exhausted after a tiring day of driving from jispa to Leh. We were all suffering from AMS and just wanted crisp white sheets, comfy beds and good bathroom. We found Indus Valley and just checked in. The hotel is new and has a good location near the market which makes most places like restaurants  very walking distance. The rooms are well appointed like a 5 star hotel and the staff are very warm and helpful. We also got locked in our room due to a faulty door lock got jammed. But it was ok. We got a late checkout and the reception staff were very sweet. I think this hotel is way better than the famous luxury Grand Dragon hotel. This has better location and the lobby and staff are way better.",JahrePollux,/Profile/JahrePollux,"Chandigarh, India",40
ladakh,"Warm welcome the staffs are wonderful superb service mind the hotel is new large room, clean neat & comfortable.  The location is great!!   You can walk to main market in 1min.  and closed to Gesmo restaurant the restaurant is Ladakhi recommend     The internet wifi here I think the best while I stayed in Ladakh.  The owner treated us like we are a part of their family.   Strongly recommend if you have to stay in Ladakh!!!  The Indus valley hotel !!! ",Nooh P,/Profile/n00hp,,50
ladakh,"For our family's  first visit to remote Leh Ladakh Indus Valley was our perfect pick. The Indus took care of our family as ""family"". Excepting for a pool ( maybe asking for too much at 11,500ft)every thing was 5* ++ all the way. Food to the children's ""liking"" and no complaints from them was a big thumbs up!! Time spent at the Indus was real vacation time ,with the rest taken care amply well by the Hotel. A big JULEY (thanks in ladakhi!!) To the Hotel and staff for a great time . My rating 5+++ April 2019",Ashwani,/Profile/959ashwaniv,,50
ladakh,"That is a rather new hotel in Leh advertising ""The luxury stay..."". My experience was really bad. Arriving from a longer tent trek we wanted to take a shower, but trying to do this the power went off (that happens frequently in Leh), but the hotel's generator did not start. So : no power, no lights, no water. After complaining the generator was fixed, water was available but not the shower. Next complaint, then the water pressure was raised to reach also the 2nd floor. When returning from dinner our 2nd floor was dark, the fuse was broken.  We now checked more carefully what was going on. We found several holes in the walls (in room and staircase)  with cables were ending there. In our room there was no smoke detector, only open holes in the ceiling. There was a lamp with cables",Review314159,/Profile/Review314159,"Karlsruhe, Germany",20
ladakh,"My trip to Leh was planned in a day, and not knowing anything except that it is a beautiful place and worth visiting it. The owner of the Hotel Mr Parvez with his support staff handled my entire trip from getting permits to getting a good cab with a good driver. The Hotel is located near to main market, which adds to its advantage, the staff are friendly and specially Mr Parvez,the owner. The rooms are spacious and cleanliness is good. The food is good. Special mention is required for Mr Schenzen and Mr Dawa(Cab Driver) who with the above mentioned made our trip memorable.",GOPAL B,/Profile/GOPALB235,,50
ladakh,"The Indus Valley is a new luxury hotel located in Leh. It has all the modern amenities and features one would expect on a 4* luxury hotel including a large screen LED television. Beds are comfortable. Another big advantage is is its proximity to the restaurants and shopping area. Popular restaurants like Lamayuru, Chopsticks, Gesmo, etc are about a 3-4 minute walk. At present only one coffee shop/ restaurant is operational with plans to open more soon. Since its not a large property one misses something like a game room with table tennis, carrom, pool or gym. Our room only had a view of the front parking area. Also I feel the staff need so more training. They are polite but do not understand everything. Surely a hotel to stay at with excellent rooms and convenient location.",GauravChand,/Profile/GauravChand,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"After a month of trekking in Ladakh we were desperate for a quiet, clean room that had a hot shower and a bed. The Indus is tucked away in a quiet part of Leh, however close to the restaurants and shops. It is a boutique hotel only recently opened. The owner went out of his way to show us what the rooms were like and even offered us an upgrade. There are not many places in Leh that offer this level of accommodation. The staff were exceptional especially Stanzin Odzer. Stanzin appears to be there 24/7, nothing is too much trouble for him. Stanzin use to guide treks up Stok Kangri and his knowledge of the region was invaluable. The breakfast that is included in the price was one of the best that I have experienced.I highly recommend this hotel.",superstarAdelaide,/Profile/superstarAdelaide,Adelaide,50

ladakh,"We traveled to Leh in June 2018 and had booked ourselves at this Hotel. Needless to say, I was blown away by what the hotel had to offer. A central location, beautiful luxurious rooms, and amazing service, however, what really gets to you is how passionately the hotel has been designed. Everything about this place showed the passion of our lovely hosts Sonam and Sylvia. They are some of the best hosts I've ever met. The food at this hotel is the best I've had in Leh, they have a made to order system which is an absolute blessing. A total homely feeling!

ladakh,"I was suggested Indus Valley hotel for my vacation in Leh - Ladakh. I was a bit apprehensive as my research showed that this was the hotel’s first season. But as I entered the Indus valley hotel,I was mesmerised by its awe inspiring interior. It indeed spoke volumes of the pain staking efforts put in by the management in its making. The M.D Mr Sonam who greeted us with his warm smile, has a multifaceted personality. His friendly and courteous nature is translated onto his staff. The rooms are spacious, neat and clean with state of art interior . The multi cuisine restaurant serves gourmet food. The most striking feature is the A-la-carte menu for all the meals of the day. The food is hot, delicious and the service is prompt. It indeed is home away from home.",Vaidehi1,/Profile/Vaidehi1,"Mumbai, India",50

One night we stayed at the Royal Suite Room- Two large well furnished rooms with attached balcony, bath tub with jaccuzi, extremely comfy beds...  Staff is very helpful. Hotel is walking distance from the main market. Chef Jassi and his team is an expert when it comes to food. Culinary classes were conducted and we learnt how to make Pizza and Momos. The desserts very simply amazing. Special thanks to hotel owner Mr. Sonamji, he is a gem of a person. He made us feel like we were his family members and made our stay in Leh very, very memorable .

ladakh,Anything new comes with challenges and especially when it's in a place like ladakh where even basic vegetation and air is a luxury. Still if you find people with the attitude to help and trying to make ur stay comfortable you absolutely love it..... The only luxury property I could see in all of ladakh... And luxury that you can find in a city like Bombay.....  Beautifully crafted rooms.... Gourmet style customised meals with the best of fruits veggies and cheese..... Absolutely helpfull staff..... Just walking distance from main market..... We were also the very first to book an entire package from them including stay and travel to nubra and pangong and all I said is I like luxury and the hotel owner Sonam made sure I got the best places to stay in and a personal car driver -,Payal B,/Profile/PayalB163,,50
