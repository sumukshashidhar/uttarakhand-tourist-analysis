ladakh,"First of all, would like to thank Mr. Zuber and Ramesh jifor making my trip memorable. Each and every staff in this hotel is courteous and would always serve you with a smile. We stayed in 3rd floor corner room which offers the best view possible from the hotel. Food was too good and we couldn't resist overeating. They even customized and made the food more palatable as per our taste buds. Climbing 3 floors in Leh is painstaking but they were never late in helping us whenever we called for room service. We didn't have mobile network there and Ramesh ji never hesitated before letting us using his mobile for multiple phone calls. In one word, they are truly outstanding in customer service and I would highly recommend it to everybody.

Emergency oxygen facility ( which is essential in high altitudes) Don't expect much on room service and internet/ wi fi connectivity. Very convenient location, close to the main market of Leh.

ladakh,First of all I would like to thank Mr. Zuber Ahmed and Mr Ramesh for their excellent hospitality. My daughter was quite ill the day we reached Leh and Mr Ahmed personally took us to the Hospital where she had to be given oxygen. Both were extremely cordial and helpful during our stay. The hotel is slightly far from the market but set amongst the woods with a fountain running close to the hotel. You have excellent view of snow capped mountains and Shanti Stupa from the upper floors. The hotel is clean and rooms are large enough. Our first floor corner room had a nice wooden work and a large balcony. The food was excellent and very suitable for Bengalis from Kolkata.

Small welcome gesture by greeting with traditional white scarf will be well remembered by us.

We stayed in the top floor room for 2 nights and then shifted to ground floor. We found that top floor room was much smaller and not so well maintained as the ground floor one.  The food was very okay with not much variety. But, considering that you are in Leh, you will need to make certain compromises.  The main disadvantage is the distance from the market.

Far off from the market and it would be a pain to get back from the market to the hotel. Hotel staff I wouldn't say are very cooperative. Rooms and washrooms are clean though. Food is not up to the standards. Half the time not edible. No lifts. We had a hard time climbing up the stairs to the 3rd floor.

Reaching the hotel at odd times is really difficult and expensive as you don't get taxis to drop you. May be the hotel should have pick up and drop upto the main road. Food was not that great may be because the Led Srinagar Road was not yet opened. There are huge windows for a great view but they don't have good thick curtains which are necessary to keep the cold out in the night. In a stay of 8 days we took bath only twice, but getting hot water is a big problem. Every time we had to call the staff and wait for may be 30 mins to get hot water.

The hotel is well maintained and located in lower Changspa area which is little far from the market. The room was in a good condition, well maintained with all the modern amenities.  The hotel has a generator facility since  power cuts are frequent.  Restaurant was average, There was not much options available in the food since supplies are so frequent in the month of April. Hospitality was good. Overall the stay was very comfortable and memorable.  It is advisable that people coming from low altitude area should take one day rest at hotel before travelling to high altitude area.

We were picked up promptly from the airport, albeit in a rickety van and driven to the hotel. At first glance it's lovely, surroundings are nice and you can easily get rides into the town centre (the walk is actually quite long and not ideal at that altitude). Then we were taken straight to breakfast where Aloo ke Paranthe were prepared for us, with toast and omelettes (the last we saw of omelettes!). Reasonably tasty yes, but it quickly got boring.  The we were told there was wifi available which was a relief, and were shown to our 4th floor rooms (no lift, as others have mentioned, so a horrible climb).

The property needs proper cleaning in its back and front yard. We saw all types of scraps and old items of hotels lying everywhere which was eye sore. Market place is far and adds taxi costs.

We were welcomed by the staff with traditional flags put around our neck. It took some time for them to provide 4 rooms; since some of us had to use the bathroom after a long journey from Bangalore - they provided 1 room immediately. During our stay, since some of them had problems climbing to 2nd floor ; they shifted our entire group of 10 people to rooms that were available in the ground floor. We just wanted to be together & enjoy as a group which the staff understood & catered to.

ladakh,Visited Leh in the month of May. Its the start of tourist season. The hotel is well maintained. This review is for the the Delux room of the hotel.  Cant say how the other rooms are.  The room was in a very good condition and well maintained. It was a traditional type of room with modern ameneties. Room is equipped with a LCD television and one can get all major entertainment and news channels.  The hotel has a generator facility as there are frequent power cuts.  Hot water is supplied only for 2 to 2.5 hours inthe morning and evenings which i believe is with most other hotels in the city. Cold water is available 24 hours.   Bathroom was very clean with expensive fittings. Normal toiletries are supplied.  Food of this hotel is good and limited room service is available.

ladakh,"OK, first the positives: Rooms were reasonably clean. The ones on the first and second floors were spacious and had a nice view. However, we also spent one night in a ground floor room which was not as spacious and lacked privacy (the window looked onto the main hotel entrance, as a result of which we had to always keep the curtains closed).  But the negatives far outweigh the positives. The service was lousy and the food was terrible. To give you a few examples of just how bad it was: 1. On our day of arrival, we were both down with altitude sickness and our room was in the top floor (no lift). We called up the restaurant and requested them to send us a simple meal to our room.

Life is quite rough and basic in Leh during that time of the year but the smile of the friendly staff made us feel at home.  Even the owner and his friendly wife spent time with us over a nice cup of tea.  Food had to be flown in from Delhi and there was not so much variation although the cook tried his very best.  It gets really cold at night.  On a final note found this hotel by chance after we found out that the Indian site www.makekytrip.com made us pay for another hotel that was closed for renovation.
