ladakh,"We loved the place from the first moment. We had a great welcoming, the room was freshly cleaned and smelled super nice, and the staff was very attentive all the time. Food was tasty. The rooms are a bit cold, but we asked for extra blankets and had an amazing sleep. The hot shower works out and they provided us with shampoo, towels, slippers, etc. Just perfect. There are cats around, they were in the kitchen as well, which might not be ok for those who are alergic, this is something to be careful about. Anyway, we loved our staying, thanks a lot!",Roxana A,/Profile/roxanaa76,,50

ladakh,"This is hands down the best homestay in all of Leh. The location is great. Singhey uncle is a great host, he absolutely treated us like family. Aunty makes amazing parathas to driveaway all the hunger. The stay is clean and super comfortable with great views. Must visit",shamli__,/Profile/shamlee1995,"Navi Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"A very cosy, comfortable Homestay with excellent food, very helpful and warm hosts. The rooms are spacious, absolutely clean with hot water available through the day. Dinner was delicious. Breakfast is served at the terrace overlooking the hills. The hosts were really helpful - will return to this place again.",Jayanthi V,/Profile/CopenhagenJayanthi,Copenhagen,50
ladakh,"If you are in Leh, and need a homestay, I would recommend Lhachik Guest House. This place is owned by Mr. & Mrs. Singay who are perhaps the best of Host that you can expect.  Mr. Singay had a lovely home, with several rooms converted for accepting guests, in Single Room or Double / Family rooms. Each room is spotlessly clean, well furnished, and extremely clean washroom. Hot water is available in Geysers fitted in washroom.  The place is just 900mtrs from Leh Bazaar...i.e. the main market place. The walk through the local village houses is exhilarating.   Mrs. Singay is a wonderful cook and can prepare any dish that you want. Breakfast is wonderful with Alu Paratha. Dinner can be available if you order beforehand. Else you can walk down 150mtrs to the nearby Crossroads",Sandeep  K,/Profile/836sandeepk,"Kolkata, India",50
ladakh,We stayed in Lhachik guest house for 4 days. The stay was par excellent. The food was too good. The services of Mr Singha (owner) and his wife are just superb. Mr Singha also guided for sight seeing at Nubra and Pangong. He also got bookings done there and arranged taxi at discounted rates.,Pankaj G,/Profile/436pankajg,,50
ladakh,"Nice room, wonderfull familly and amazing diners ... A verry beatifull vue Prices verry interresting Verry quiet and 5 minuts from center by foot Lhachik can also book a taxi for a day, or just for picking up at the airport  My really best experience in India  I love them !!!!",Trail583022,/Profile/Trail583022,"Verneuil-sur-Vienne, France",50
ladakh,"The family are so welcoming and friendly. The guest house is spotlessly clean and the food is very good. It is quite a walk away from the town centre but we like the peace and quiet. Our landlord even gave us a lift to the office when we went trekking, nothing is too much trouble. I would definitely recommend this guest house.",Kate R,/Profile/kater634,"Penrith, United Kingdom",40
ladakh,"We were only due to stay here for two nights but arrived earlier unannounced as our other booking had construction work that was noisy. Singay the host was so accommodating and got us a room. He also arranged all of our driving transfers and we generally felt like we were in a home away from home. The rooms are a good size,  clean with hot water. The location is also great. A little away from the main road but close to Changspa for shopping and eating. A great place to stay! ",Natasha_83,/Profile/Natasha_83,"London, UK",50
ladakh,"Lhachik is definitely a home away from home. 10 of us as a family with both older folks and a small baby stayed at Lhachik for 4-5days. Mr. & Mrs Singey hosted us as if we were family, caring for us when three in the group fell sick. He took us to the hospital late at night and stayed all thru. Mrs. Singey's food is heavens delight in a place like Leh. They opened their kitchen for us allowing us to cook a meal when the older folks in the family fell sick wanting south indian rasam.  He took care of all our travel bookings and gave us concession. We wouldn't have enjoyed our short Leh trip if we hadn't stayed at Lhachik. All this comes with good clean rooms with good view, breakfast and dinner, WiFi facility... What more does one need?!",jeangiftyj,/Profile/jeangiftyj,Chennai,50
