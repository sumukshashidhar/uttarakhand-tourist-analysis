Noble house is situated on main Leh market, fort road, a bit inside from the road opposite to Namgyl Palace Hotel.   The most amazing thing about this hotel is the view from its roof top cafeteria. Beautiful mountains covered with snow gives you a hypnotism.   Rooms are good with good views and clean washrooms.

Room and Hotel Staff: Hotel staff was very nice and we felt overwhelmed and welcomed over there. We had all wood interiors in our room. Heating arrangement was good. We had supply of warm water from 6 am in morning. Warm water is very much required in Laddakh region due to chilling weather. They have Tata Sky DTH in rooms. Tata Sky had some problem in signal during our visit. But getting a DTH at such a remote place itself is a big achievement. After all, one is not supposed to watch TV when in Leh.

Very tasty food though with a long stay you might want a little more variety in the food. A big thank you to Pawan, Hussein and the rest of the staff. The main market is just a 5min walk and there are a lot of good eating places and shopping options. A word of caution though as cars do not go right up to the hotel though its just a walk of 10m and you can take bikes right in.

They accommodate requests and even call to check on what you might need. The chef makes some really good Indian food, better than most hotels.  There is no a/c but it is not needed as the temperature, even in June, is cool enough at night. Even during the day one can leave the windows open, but one really shouldn't be in the hotel during the day.

ladakh,"I have been to this hotel for several times, coming always back and being welcomed as if  I were a family member. They would do anything for you ... questions ... taxis ... anything, you need it they get it for you or they provide it  for you. I am definitely coming back to this very nice location ... just by car a few minutes from the airport ... by foot  ""the"" road for looking around and shopping ... being buddhas ... dvds ... or fruits ... or may be just visiting old friends ....",Susanne0704,/Profile/Susanne0704,"Liestal, Switzerland",40
ladakh,"I went ot Ladakh on tour with a fairly large group who were booked to stay at the Hotel Noble  House in Leh. A couple of people suffered from mild symptoms of altitude sickness while 2 people were rushed to the emergency of a hospital there. Dorjee the manager of the Hotel went out of his way to ensure that everyone was well looked after during the ""Chaos"" the first couple of days.  Well beyond words is how Dorjee's personalised service was.",Discover Ladakh Adventure Tours & Travel,/Profile/dlatours,"Leh, India",50
ladakh,Hotel Noble House is a small hotel with only 17 rooms but the views from the rooftop restaurant is fantastic. It is located just 10 minutes walk from the main town area.  The pillar of this hotel is the wonderful Dorjee Tamang who goes out of his way to ensure your holiday is special.  For detatils log on to: www.noblehouseleh.com,mandijus,/Profile/mandijus,Mumbai,50
ladakh,When we came in to the hotel... we were sceptical... but the stuff completely won us over... I am a very very pickey person and the stuff and their service was out of the world. Our stay in Leh would not have been the same but for these guys. They ran from pillar to post to provide  us with anything we wanted.,banditadutt,/Profile/banditadutt,Gorakhpur,50
