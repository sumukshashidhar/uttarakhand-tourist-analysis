ladakh,"Очень приятная семья - покормят (вкусно), согреют. как раз то, что нужно в этом далеком уголке Ладакха. Есть вайфай, теплая вода (солнечный нагрев, поэтому рассчитайте, когда она самая теплая), унитаз - это уже огромные удобства для этой местности.  Очень красивый вид на монастырь и окрестности. Отличное расположение - все рядом.",Sutasu,/Profile/Sutasu,,50
ladakh,"We spent a night there on our trip to Western Ladakh. It was the only place in Lamayuru we could find online and book it in advance.   It offers clean rooms with dinner and breakfast for 2500 ruppees (a room with a bathroom). They offer cheaper accommodation too, if you would need that.   A great thing about this place is the location, which is 5 minutes from the monastery - on foot uphill, and monastery is the thing you come for in Lamayuru.   The place offers decent food and decent rooms, but beds are short like in most of Ladakh, which is not so ok for me as a tall European. The electricity is not working all the time and wifi is so so. Of course there’s no wifi when there’s no electricity. But that is common in all the remote places of Ladakh. ",Yoorekk,/Profile/Yoorekk,Slovenia,40
ladakh,"We spent a few hours in the kitchen of this lovely family while they tried to arrange accommodation for us during the very busy festival time. We were so impressed by the energy of all the daughters. We were sad that we didn't land up staying there (although they did offer us a lovely warm place in a sitting room area for the night). The residence is conveniently situated 3 minutes walk from the main road where the bus would drop you, so it is an ideal place to stay if you arrive late in the day or at night. I would recommend staying here to experience friendly Ladakh family hosipitality.",Vivien C,/Profile/906vivienc,"Cape Town, South Africa",50
