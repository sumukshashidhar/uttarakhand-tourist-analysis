ladakh,"Generally speaking, we had fairly good experience staying at Shanti Nest (Shanti Home) hotel. Rigzhin, the chief of staff (supervisor-manager) was resourceful and considerate. He was enthusiastic, active and knowledgeable. Ahmed was ever helpful, gentle and soft spoken. Cooks provided specific items as per your needs. And it is ideally situated a little away from din and noise of the city. Though the approach to the gate was a little difficult, overall we had an enjoyable experience. Old building provided a great view of Khardungla Mountains on one side and the Leh Monastery and Fort on the other. The tourists can also easily visit Shanti Stupa which overlooks the hotel. Food is palatable with a lot of variety. We cannot eat spicy food and good thing was that the food was not",Shelika Gaur,/Profile/Shelika_Gaur,,50

ladakh,"The guest-house room was small very basic and uncomfortable. Hard mattresses, tiny shower, quite dirty and the whole facility was smelly. WiFi signal was very weak. The location is far from everything.  We had to stay three nights because my husband and daughter became very sick, otherwise we would have left much earlier. On the bright side, most of the staff members were nice and accommodating. In the end we were over-charged and paid much more than we expected, as if we stayed in a fancy hotel. My suggestion - stay away! ",merav68,/Profile/merav68,Israel,20

ladakh,"We visited Leh in the winter, and planned to stay at Shanti guest house for two nights before moving on to Ladakh. The first impression was that of the idyllic location - the setting is just breathtaking. the staff is very friendly, and there's nice teas available along with warm water for drinking, and the food is very good! The rooms are as good as can be expected from a budget hotel, but the disappointments were the lack of heating in the room - the heaters weren't working during our stay, and the warm water, which was given in large drums, which, in the minus 5 degree weather, would quickly become very cold. As a result, we had to move out after one night. But I think our experience might be an aberration - they did say that the heaters not working was an exception.",Chaw Mean,/Profile/Chaw_Mean,"Mumbai, India",30

He attended to all our needs from arranging accommodation in Nubra and Pangong (excellent places) and the vehicle (Toyota Innova, a real workhorse and a pity they are not available in Sri Lanka). The best was the guide cum driver, Nanam (be sure to request him if you happen to visit), an excellent and skillful driver with typical Ladakhi sincerity and politeness.

Its a very nice and clean homestay that is run by a family that stays in the same building. Food is also very delicious and homely [orders need to be given in advance]. The home stay is a stone's throw away from Shanti Stupa, Leh Palace and Changspa road. During Tourist season this means that the Home stay is very close to all the Hotels, shopping areas and places of interest.  During Winters this is one of the very few Home stays that are open and is in popular demand among our trekking community.You would be sure to meet a lot of travellers and get to hear a lot of stories.The property has central heating",Kaushik710,/Profile/Kaushik710,"Bengaluru, India",50

They gave us a beautiful corner room with stunning views of the surrounding snow-capped Himalayas and made us feel extremely well-cared for.

ladakh,I have stayed here several times over the years. The location is good as it is not in the busy centre of Leh so not so much street noise. It is a basic guest house but the price matches the basic nature. If you want all the amenities of a hotel this is not the place but for a basic place to stay in Leh it is fine. I use it to base groups in before and after trekking expeditions.,Peter S,,"Perth, United Kingdom",40

The rooms are sparsely furnished and basic amenities like hot water, electricity, clean beds are ensured. Our visit was quite close to the beginning of winter and most of the places in Leh were shut with majority of the staff either on holiday or on the move out to their native places. Despite this, our stay of almost 4 days was awesome and after a tiring day of sight seeing it was just the place to unwind. Located very close to the Shanti Stupa it is a lovely walk down to the main market area. The hosts and especially their little granddaughter was extremely charming :) Food served was wholesome fare.

They have cozy heating system that helped me to stay warm throughout the day yet the outside Leh city temperature was -10’c.

The neighbourhood, Changspa, was peaceful and mostly populated with other guesthouses and hotels. As it was almost winter and off-peak season for tourists, that could explain why the area was so silent and lovely.

Considering the fact that both of us are students, the guest house turned out to be the perfect budgeted, comfortable and friendly place for us to call 'home' while in Leh. The rooms were spacious, with big windows to let in a lot of sunlight every morning which, was superb. Wi-Fi (though slightly intermittent) was available to us in the evenings (except when there wasn't power). The best thing about our stay was that we would spend the entire day out and in the evenings have a lovely, warm, homemade meal with all the other guests in the guest house kitchen. One week into our stay we had become friends with the family, who were present round the",Vasu21b,/Profile/Vasu21b,"Dilli, Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"We stayed at the Shanti GH in May 2012 for 2 weeks and had one of the corner rooms on the 2nd floor with great views over the mountains. The room had hot water, tv with loads of channels and there is free wifi though the signal is pretty weak. Upon arrival at the airport we were picked up at no charge and driven up to the property. The GH is located up by Shanti stupa and while it is a bit of walk into the town centre, 20 mins or so, it is worth it to be in a quieter area and the shops and restaurants of changspa road are only 5 mins or so away.  The family who run the place are very friendly and helpful. My wife and I were looking to stay on in Leh for a couple of months and were trying to find an apartment to rent. The family made extensive enquiries for us and eventually",bluehoatzin,/Profile/bluehoatzin,"Brighton, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"The family (owners) are extremely friendly and helpful. They were also very accommodating with my unpredictable schedule of trekking and climbing. The rooms are comfortable with good views (some rooms) and very reasonably priced. They were clean - and my room on the top floor was spacious with a large bathroom. Hot water is only available in the afternoons because it's solar powered but this was never a problem for me. The breakfasts of home-made Ladakhi bread, fresh butter, and local apricot preserves were fantastic. The evening meal was very good but started a bit late for me (starting at 7:30 p.m.), which is why I only ate there twice. Highly recommended. Like in every guesthouse in the area, you need to bring your own TP or buy it there.",Gabriel C,/Profile/GabrielC589,"Madison, Wisconsin",50

We had bath and went out for lunch, spreading out in the room all our belongings which included expensive cameras and equipments. During the lunch we were talking of having a long sleeeep after many days tedious activity.  At this time the young lady from Shanti GH called up the Trek Manager and said that her mother did not know about the bookings and that we have to vacate R No. 20.  I said not to make an issue of a mistake we will vacate the room.  Reaching the place we saw the belongings of all the four of us mercilessly dumped together on the corridor.

Your supply of hot water is dependent on the benevolence of Sun. Rooms on the top floor are well lit & much better than the ones beneath..Views from corner rooms are good... Owner, Mr. Dorjey is extremely helpful & friendly...He arranged all our tours & also offered some discount on the published taxi charges... He didn't even ask us to pay anything in advance (except for the paltry sum I had transferred for blocking the rooms)..

ladakh,"Do not expect this place to be fancy. This is exactly what you will expect of Leh. An inexpensive place, friendly owners, prompt services, good breakfast, clean rooms. It is located a minute from the foothill of the flight of stairs leading to the Shanti Stupa. The view from some of the rooms is mind blowing.   The owners are really friendly and will help you with everything you need. It is just the perfect guesthouse/home stay you would imagine.  Some rooms on the top floor are very well furnished with a televisions and a mini balcony, while the others are just very average. Try to get yourself one of these.",Raisa L,/Profile/400raisal,"Mumbai, India",40
ladakh,"We (my girlfriend and me) stayed for 5 nights there. The owners were very helpful and honest! They helped us with the best and cheapest options for visiting monasteries, hike or where to buy Pashminas from (in our benefit, not the travel agencies, despite having an agency of their own). So before you enter a random travel agency in Leh, please get one piece of advice from the owners. This will probably save you lot's of money. The place was very nice also, with excellent view, a little far from the city-center. The rooms were big, nice and with lots of light but a litlle bit cold (we travelled in early may). Fortunately, the owners counterbalanced the outside cold with their warmth and nice ladakhi dinners. The final price for the 5 days stay was also very convenient.",Tudor G,/Profile/Tud0rG,"Sibiu, Romania",50

If you are looking for a hotel kind of place with very prompt service then this may not be for you. It is run by a family and its a best effort service. The room we stayed had an amazing view. It also had a balcony. If you do book here, ask for the room that is on the corner of the top floor. Spectacular view from there!!  You get pretty decent breakfast/tea in the morning. We never had lunch or dinner here. There is a very decent restaurant some 200-300 meters before this hotel on the same road. It is owned by a Punjabi and food was excellent there.

We even had a small balcony.   In the morning whilst going out on trips we used to suggest what we would like to have in dinner & more often than not Tsering, the owner used to oblige. Whenever we required any help, Tsering or his wife was available for us.  The food we had here (mostly dinner) were excellent, especially liked the local Ladakhi food they prepared for us.  The only negative thing I can say was the availibility of hot water from the tap. I guess the Guest House's boiler was not very efficient.

ladakh,"We were a group of nine, family and the experience was far from memorable.The guest house is little further from the main gate and the only way to get in through a narrow path.Believe me its pretty exhausting ,carrying luggage on account of the altitude.  When we pointed out that the room needs to be cleaned, we were rudely informed that if foreigners can stay here without any complaint whatsoever, why should Indians crib?  This place is only suitable for foreigners who are on a shoe string budget and looking for just a roof and some bread.  The cook was very rude and she was very reluctant to serve food .The stay at Shanti Guest house was the low point of our trip. All other places where we stayed were awesome, with great hospitality and warm people.  Would recommend homestay",Annapurna R,,"Mumbai, India",10
ladakh,"Shanti Guest house is a family run bed and breakfast near the Shanti Stupa in Changspa, Leh. Cleanliness is well maintained and the rooms are big and comfortable. Located right near the footsteps of the climb towards Shanti Stupa the setting is really tranquil and having a hot cup of tea along with ladakhi bread and butter as the sun rises over the snow peaked mountains can be a very spiritual experience. Though not the cheapest place to stay, it is definitely value for money as the family really takes care of your every need and it is not to form an emotional bond with them. The guest house is at least a 20 minute walk from the main market and a bit secluded. This can be a good thing or bad thing as per your choice.",vishalpipraiya,,"Pune, India",40
