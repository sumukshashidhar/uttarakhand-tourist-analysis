ladakh,"since there are not many reviews available for Youth hostel, so I was little sceptical before going there. But the experience for me there was on the top of the world for the simple reason that it is total value for money, all the basic facilities are given for accomodation. Most importantly, toilets are entirely neat and clean and in fact the entire place is very clean. THe food is very healthy which is served. Morning tea, breakfast, lunch, snacks, soup, dinner and the day ends with bournvita milk. So the staff take a very good care of you to ensure that nobody falls sick during their stay in LEH. Kudos to the entire team of youth hostel.",ankitsinghal2018,/Profile/ankitsinghal2018,"Pune, India",40
