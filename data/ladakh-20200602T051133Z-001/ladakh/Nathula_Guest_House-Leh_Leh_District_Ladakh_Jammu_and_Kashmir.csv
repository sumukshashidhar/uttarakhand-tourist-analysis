ladakh,"Our stay at Nathula Homestay was brief. Yet it retained a lasting impression about Ladhak and its people in our minds. The location is apt, near the airport but not in the crowd. The view from the hotel room is so beautiful that when you wake up the snow topped hills bathed in golden sunlight wish you a good morning! It is warm, the rooms are cozy and bath attached. There were green apples in their garden. Above all, we appreciate the hosts -  they were simply the best. Their cook and other staff had to go home, so they prepared everything for us. Aunty cooked delicious puri baji and tea (for 6 of us!) She even packed a bag full of apples that we can eat on our way. Such lovely people! We are ever so grateful for their hospitality.",RESHMI K R,,"Kozhikode, India",40
ladakh,"Booked a room here for 9 nights. The host was friendly and very helpful, suggesting places to eat and helped me find my way around.  Located a short walk from the Town Centre, the rooms were spacious and clean. Would recommend.",gmorris2018,,"Brisbane, Australia",40
ladakh,"The owner is very friendly and helpful. Sonam is always there for your comfort! Staff is also courteous. Accommodation is good, room are spacious and clean. Cozy home away from home. When my girlfriend suffered from  altitude sickness Sonam showed us the way to the doctor. They were very flexible when we wanted to extend our stay. Nice location with views on the snow topped mountains. Breakfast poor quality/price, toast (some toasted to black), marmalade and scrambled eggs for R200.",Raw_Desert,,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",40
ladakh,"Three rooms of the property are facing the breathtaking mountains. prefer the 1st floor rooms if you have a choice. the owner sonam is a busy body & is almost omni present. his warm smile is present in ALL situations & he will try to help you out in every possible way....the food is excellent with very helpful staff. If one couldn`t do much research but want to see Ladakh in every details, just land up there with ample of time at hand...& sonam will do the rest. The charges are very very just.",Kaushik B,,,50

ladakh,"I have been there for 5 days and that is the best memory for me. even if some people not satisfied bur for me, that is the best place with quality price and the best friendship. The staff can find anything you want to, everyone really active to service. Moreover, I can tried local food by asked to the staff. everything is the okay, breakfast, lunch, dinner, facilities, nice views and best services etc. Sometimes you need to know everywhere has condition, maybe weather, prosperity etc. but if you want to travel somewhere you must adapt yourself to there and i believed Nathula's staff want to serve you as possible as they can.",Chompoomuggle,/Profile/Chompoomuggle,"Bangkok, Thailand",40
ladakh,"During my visit in Leg, which lasted 3.5 weeks, I've stayed in Nathula guest house And had a very very good time. The rooms are very comfortable and in various price range, suitable for backpackers and families/couples as one, hot water guaranteed. The owners are the nicest couple I have met in India and they will help you with everything you need (I've returned from a trek and there were no rooms available, but still he made calls and even went to look for a room in other guest houses for us)",Nir_Kleinberger,/Profile/Nir_Kleinberger,,50
ladakh,"In leh we were guest at many places. Nathula guest house was ruthless ever. This place will be the last option in the world to stay. The agency who are in tieup with them Northern Valley Adventure India is a cheater. Never to go with them for any work. Wi-fi is for name sake, No television inside rooms, No hot water facility, if you ask for hot water at 7 am in the morning, then owners looks as you have asked for something that is impossible to do. Also, owner abuses and misbehaves. Towels offered are used one. Furniture are very unsafe can wound your leg. Nathula guest house will surely make your trip go bad. Even the other guest in the nathula guest house was not satisfied and faced same problems when we had words with them. If you are looking to relax and enjoy your trip",Mehul K,/Profile/765mehulk,"Mumbai, India",10
ladakh,"I stayed here a total of 6 nights. Very nice guest house with friendly owner brothers Regzin (with his wife) and Sonam. This is the place to stay at if you are looking for warm welcome, friendly advice, and expert tour planning.  Regzin and his wife took care of me at the guest house including laundry and masala teas (!) while Sonam handled the tour planning and arrangements. They also respond to emails. I will stay here again and use the tour services as well.  Providing wall hangings for clothes, a frequent change of towels, and a Table or nightstand would also be useful.",msagar,/Profile/msagar,"Framingham, Massachusetts",50
ladakh,"A very neat and well maintained family owned guest house...  Had visited Leh thrice but this was the best guest house I stayed at.   The owner couple are very caring and kind.   Very reasonably priced rooms with Good decent food. Rooms are all neatly maintained.   Though we need to go a bit far further from the market area, I would surely stay here when I visit the next time..   Thank you Mr. & Mrs. Rigzen for your warm hospitality. Hope to visit again.

ladakh,"We went to Leh for the second time, this time in winter :) In winters its difficult to find a place to stay, Most are shut down. So one advice to always do some advance bookings. This guest house is pretty much friendly and very good service. The food is also good and its located much closer to taxi stand as well. There is no AC but they can provide you room heaters. Believe me you will need them in winters.",nipanwar,/Profile/nipanwar,"Bengaluru, India",40
ladakh,We found this guest house in July and after some negotiation got rooms. The owner was courteous. Service was not that great. However room and location was good. The hotel is bit inside but should be fine if you have a vehicle.,pradyot m,/Profile/pradyotm2016,"Bengaluru, India",40

ladakh,"Nathu La is a little refuge of sanity, tea and omelettes. It's family owned, as many places in Leh are, and they are truly wonderful - welcoming, friendly, helpful and always smiling! I ended up staying in Nathu La for quite a few nights this summer over a two month period, and every time was welcomed like an old friend.  The rooms are lovely and big, clean, mostly en-suite with lovely hot showers, but even the shared bathrooms are great.  Breakfast is bread made that morning with omelettes, toast, local jam and fresh butter and endless tea! Dinner is also available with a little notice. The mo-mos are the best in town, you have to try them! It's situated out of the way of the main drag, so nice and quiet but it's just a short cut through to Changspa, or a wander down the road",Caroline_McC,/Profile/Caroline_McC,High Peak,50
ladakh,"This is a great wee guesthouse in Leh. Once you figure out how to find it, it is very central, but away from the main street so it is quiet. The family are very welcoming and solicitous, with time to chat and a regular offer of tea.  You can have a simple breakfast here of omelette and fresh-made bread. They staff will do your laundry if you don't want to go out for it. Rooms are clean and well-priced.  Thoroughly recommend it.",I_am_Douglas,/Profile/I_am_Douglas,"Linlithgow, United Kingdom",40
ladakh,"Arrived in Leh to meet my group late, but welcomed into the Nathu-La as an old friend! Rooms airy, with views of the Leh valley or the palace/stupa. Hot water in the bathrooms a nice surprise after Delhi! Stayed here 3 times on trip, never a problem to ""find room"" Great seating outside to chill out. Top place! Leh as a whole is victim of regular power cuts, so be prepared with a torch!",climbdg5,/Profile/climbdg5,"Thirsk, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"This is honestly the most amazing place! I stayed here with a large group and the family were so accommodating - it was unbelievable! As many reviews say, the hosts really do welcome you into their family with open arms! You never want to leave! Both the bathrooms and the bedrooms were always clean and tidy and if you ever needed anything, you literally just have to ask and they are happy to help. TRY THE VEGETABLE MOMOS! They were the best that we found in the whole of Leh!",traveltheworldtoday1,/Profile/traveltheworldtoday1,"London, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"I stayed here while on an expedition in a large group, the family went out of their way to help us (one time in particular when our trek was cancelled due to bad weather, they made sure we all had rooms to sleep in for the next few days, even though we were such a large group!) Most mornings they provided us with breakfast which was lovely, and on two occasions they cooked us vegetable momos for dinner which were definitely a team favourite! There was always hot water, the rooms were very clean and the view from my room was amazing. The family were so kind to us- some of the loveliest people I've ever met! Thank you for making us feel so welcome!",Cosmo59,/Profile/Cosmo59,"St Albans, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"A marvelous view to Stok Kangri, large rooms, very friendly and helpful owners made our stay in Leh to a excellent experience. I can recommand it to every one who likes cleen rooms, a hot shower, god food and more. A garden with lots of flowers invites you to have a rest after beeing in the busy streets in Leh..",seviniki,/Profile/seviniki,Zürich,50
ladakh,"We were lucky to find this place just by chance after checking the entire area's guesthouses. Nathu-La definitely offers a great stay, the family is awesome and very helping, cheerful and opened. They cooked us amazingly good Ladakhi dinner. It is maybe the only place with 24/7 hot water, the rooms are huge and clean, it has a big garden with vegetables and spices, also the location is very nice and peacful with great views o the Himalayas, but the most important thing is it feels like home. :)",kriwie,/Profile/kriwie,"Sofia, Grad Sofiya, Bulgaria",50
ladakh,"We stayed for 10 days and it was the perfect experience in Leh, the family that runs the place is very kind, they gave us many tips to visit around Leh. Our room was very big and clean, they have a very nice garden with their own veggies. Hot water is not a problem here since they have it all the time and if you ask, you can have real and delicious ladakhi food.   The location is great, 5 mins away from many restaurants and internet cafe.  If you want to have the real ladakhi experience, don't hesitate to stay here!",Alejorky,/Profile/Alejorky,"Sofia, Bulgaria",50
