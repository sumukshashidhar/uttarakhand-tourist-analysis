ladakh,"Very good and quiet place in leh, good value for money, I recommend this guest house . But a little bit far from the main market then away from the noise. The breakfast is good and cheap. Easily accessible in motorbike. üëç",Loyeke m,/Profile/loyekem,,50
ladakh,"This was our base for our Leh Ladak trip. Thank you Lobzang for recommending this place. The rooms were clean and spacious. I loved the simple decor and huge windows of the room. The view from the balcony was nice. Located at a very quiet lane. Also, the market is at a walking distance from the guest house. The owners (uncle & aunty) are very warm and welcoming by nature. Aunty even made a local Ladaki salad of mixed vegetables for us one day which was very tasty. Their son also is very kind and has all information on the local travel. We enjoyed our stay at the guest house to the fullest. We would definitely stay again when we travel to Leh in future :)",PiniB22,/Profile/PiniB22,,50

ladakh,"As said first impressions are the best ones,my first experience of landing at Leh is this homestay. It was truly a heartwarming experience.It felt like a home. Especially the food. They served hot rice with dal, brinjal curry, pickle and papad that day. The rooms were very neat and spacious. The washrooms are with hot water supply all the day. They have a traditional dining area , which is interesting. All kudos to the caretakers of the villa.Thank you for adding to our most beautiful days at Leh more special and memorable.",Aswathi,/Profile/AswathiHari,"Kollam, India",50

ladakh,"Me and my wife stayed here for 5 days in 2nd week of September 2018. I would like to admit, the warmth of the place & the owners was very vibrant. The parents (whom we always reffered as Uncle & Aunt) and their son (Rinchen) were always smiling. They were always talking to us as if we have known them for ages. They made sure we had everything covered for trips (Warm Clothes, plan of the day, dos and donts etc) before we stepped out of their house. They way they cooked and served us local ladakhi food was equally special for us.  The rooms are quite comfortable and clean with a very good kitchen garden, warm water, Television & wifi availble. It also has lovely views of the mountains. The house is not located very far from Leh Market it would take approx 15 minutes by foot to",TripMember02292016,/Profile/TripMember02292016,"New Delhi, India",50

ladakh,"The Gangzing Villina was our base in Leh during our trip in Ladakh and every time we came back, it was like going back home. The family who runs it is extremely nice, helpful and welcoming. The villina is surrounded by amazing views of the himalayan mountains, it is super clean and comfortable. It was really hard to leave it when our trip was over. I highly recommend it to anyone who is passing by Leh!",Karis amata Z,/Profile/karisamataz,"Florence, Italy",50
ladakh,"This guest house has been definitely our best stay in whole India! The house it's charming, very very clean and in a nice and quite part of Leh! The family who runs the guest house it's even better, they're so nice and always smiling that you can't wait to go back after every trek around the area. It'll feel just like to be home. They also cooked for us typical Ladakhi food and every morning there's a fantastic breakfast in their typical living room.   The room are perfect, bed clean and perfumed sheets, good facilities, clean toilet, hot water, plenty space for luggage storage & beautiful light getting in from the big windows.  I'll definitely suggest this place and I'll do my best one day to go back to Gangzing Villina, we just loved everything of it!  ",Ale M,/Profile/Alementare,"Florence, Italy",50

ladakh,"We originally were meant to stay at SilverCloud guesthouse but sadly the owner was hospitalised so our booking was cancelled. We were initially very worried where we would end up. Although the owner was in hospital, he found us an alternative to stay at Gangzing Villina. He also organised for a taxi to pick us up from the airport and take us to the new guesthouse. We were greeted by the father and his two sons. From the moment we arrived they treated us like kings. They were so welcoming, fun and friendly that we felt very comfortable straight away. They were very helpful in organising our daily trips and liaising with the driver. They even accompanied us a few times to facilitate discussions with the locals and monks. The father prepared for us delicious food every evening and",S√©bastien G,/Profile/899s_bastieng,,50
