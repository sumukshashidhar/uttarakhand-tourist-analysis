ladakh,We stayed  in this camp for a night during our visit to Pangong tso. Location  is on the shores of the lake and on the quieter  area. View of the lake is awesome  and one can reach the lake by walking about 100 meters. It's about 3 km away from the first camping area.  Tents are basic but clean with  attached bath with running  water. They are also somewhat windproof. Hot water is supplied in buckets but would  become cold by the  time it reaches and wait is long as boiling  water at minus temperature is time consuming.  Do carry wetwipes as water can be ice cold Nights are cold with temperatures  going down to minus 5 degrees. You will be provided with lots of blankets but you must wear thermals while sleeping.  Food is average but  you cant expect more in a desolate  place,somam,/Profile/somam,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
ladakh,"First thing first...Pangong is located at very high altitude, so head-ache and breathless ness are common here. Its very uncomfortable feeling, but the beauty of the Lake and surroundings makes one forget everything else. This camp is at walking distance from the Lake. About the camp, the Tent was clean and so is the bed and bedsheets. Electricity is almost an alien concept so be prepared with adequate charge in mobiles/camera batteries.  This place is very chilly and tents do not offer any respite from the chilly air....woolen clothing is therefore absolute must.  Food is strictly okay....for sustenance purpose only.

ladakh,My wife and I checked in this camp on the 4th of July. The amenities are very basic and the tents are average. Camp is a bit far from the Pangong Lake but a good view of the Lake is available. Food is decent and the staff are courteous. Overall a decent stay but expected much more,Anant S,/Profile/875anants,"Kolkata, India",30
ladakh,"The place is nice, but in the end corner it is. The crew here is not helpful, they don't care much for the guests. But if you're at your own this place is nice in the budget. 4 for the camp, 2 for the service & hospitality. The owner is good but he wasn't in Pangong when we arrived.",arungautam10,/Profile/arungautam10,"New Delhi, India",30
ladakh,Please be aware of the good pictures of the camp uploaded. They fool you by giving you the worst tent not even in the pictures and will say rest are occupied. on complaint to owner he assures to refund the money but back out later. hated the expereince completely. last day of trip was spoilt.,nidhi b,/Profile/nidhib268,,20
ladakh,"Tents were better than the one shown in image. Tensts were neat & clean and had ample space for accomodating upto 3 people. Though tents are not aside to pangong lake, still view of lake from camp site is just awesome....... due to camp location is on height than the lake, you can have a big view of lake, nearby mountains and many more...... Due to remoteness of the location (pangong lake) dont expect 24hrs electricicty and water, though the arrangements were excellent and more imporatnatly food offered was very good. Thnumb-up for the ""Pangong Delight Camp""",Ameya L,/Profile/AmeyaL6,,50
ladakh,"If you really want the comfort of a hotel like room in a tent with your personal bathroom, this is the place for you. It's a bit far from the point where the lake starts and from the hustle bustle but that isn't much of an issue because there camp is by the lake and the view of the lake from this site is breathtaking.Also the dinner and breakfast are amazing and the team handling the place is really cordial and helpful. There's a fixed time for hot water.",Arnav G,/Profile/ArnavG40,,50
ladakh,nothing great about this place...tents are below average...no running hot water in the room...no electricity for most of the day...cramped up space...no arrangements for keeping your luggage..below average food ..pathetic dinner options..all in all donot stay if option is available,sushil sharma,/Profile/sush555,"Mumbai, India",20
ladakh,Nice place to visit. Awesome hospitality by them. Near the lake so nice view. In morning as well as evening time. Good food and breakfast. Well response by employees their. Camps were good and hot water facility were available.,UMESH H,/Profile/691umeshh,,50
ladakh,"We booked this place via online portal with a price tag of less than 3k . With such cold weather and high altitude already does enough to keep one on the edge, they should provide minimal service. The staff try to help upon request however it does lack basic training on handling basic ammenites such as  hot water request , power supply etc. Food is very basic and minimal. Wouldnt visit for the second time and there are better options nearby.",Sanexplorer666,/Profile/Sanexplorer666,"Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,"You do not really expect the world in the middle of nowhere in a tent. But I was wrong. We visited Pangong lake on 21st July and stayed at Delight Camp for the night (tent# 6).  Cozy yet spacious tents with attached washroom and a sit out in front with wonderful view of the lake. Served with hot tea and biscuits upon arrival. Carpeted floor, quality bedding and comforters; enough to keep you warm without the need for a heater. Food requires a special mention as it was nothing short of a feast (soup, mix veg, Palak paneer, chole, roti, rice, salad, papad and sooji halwa). Staff was very courteous and helpful.Electricity is available for limited 3 hours which works for the best I must say - forced me to make the most of the scenic beauty. Special thanks to Angchuk & Rajkumar who",kumars03,/Profile/kumars03,"Pune, India",50
ladakh,"Pangong delight camp gave us good hospitality. The view of the lake, the climate, the food and the scenic beauty surrounding the camp made us have a rich and an unforgettable experience. The host did a good job of making us comfortable. Keep up the hospitality. Cheers..!! ",vivek s,/Profile/viveks2827,,40
ladakh,"We went with an immpression that Camping in Pangong So would be a peaceful and quiet affair. The camps are bunch together like a slum closely packed next to the main thorough fare and there is a continuous stream of bikes and vehicles almost upto 2 in the morning. In our camp we had a group of youngsters singing Karaoke untill one in the morning and drunk out of their minds. All in all a terrible experience,that we want to forget. Food was mediocre camp food which sufficed. Camp decorum must be maintained to maintain the peace and tranquility of the place.",nikrang,/Profile/nikrang,"Hyderabad, India",30
ladakh,"Pangong isn't a place where one would bear with bad service, as altitude already does enough to keep one on the edge. Pangong Delight Camp did exactly that. Staff is clueless mostly on what they are upto and have no idea how to communicate with the clients. They are in simple words - RUDE. Breakfast, lunch, dinner - was as bad as it could get, tasteless and mostly served cold but they couldn't care less. Would strongly recommend not to stay here.",Subodh S,/Profile/subodhs165,Dubai,20
ladakh,"We were group of 9 people who visited the Pangong lake on 12th July and we stayed at Pangong Delight Camp for one night. The tents were amazing with all the basic amenities. All the staffs were very courteous and upon arrival we were welcomed with tea and biscuits.  Upon request, they had also arranged bonfire for us. It's not on the house, so you will have to pay for it but it was totally worth it.  Food was amazing as well. Hats off to the guys who cook such great food at such challenging conditions.  All in all it was an excellent stay through out.",kushaal v,/Profile/kushaalv,,50
ladakh,"So i just stayed here for a night. Very different experience. Its really close to the most beautiful thing in leh, ladakh- pangong Tso lake. The beauty of the lake mesmerises you so much that everything else fades. The blue waters, the mountains, indescribable.  Its a reasonable place and they make us stay in tents which have a double bed along with basic bathroom facilities & a backup torch. The lukewarm water is also available.  The staff was nice and the service was good. So was the food. It was tasty & hot.  Overall it was a nice experience to spend a night here.",sagunagupta,/Profile/sagunagupta,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
ladakh,"Went there with my friends post exams in July, so you can guess we were ready for one crazy trip. Stayed for a couple of nights at this camp. Lots of fun filled memories made at this very place. Everything ranging from the accommodation to meals to hospitality was truly commendable. It was quite good and reasonable as well. The location of the camp in itself is very nice and to add to it, the amazing view of the Pangong Tso lake during the night is surely a once in a lifetime experience. One hell of a trip. Will be cherished for lifetime. And can definitely say, the extreme experience of Roads Less Travelled team resulted in the smooth execution of stay and trip. If you are visiting Leh, then don't miss the opportunity to stay in camp to have a fun filled experience.",JanakMaheshwari,/Profile/JanakMaheshwari,"Noida, India",50
ladakh,"We booked Pangong delight camp in advance but we were shocked to see the tents we got allocated. They were the last tents behind their large kitchen tent. When we highlighted this and asked them for a change the guy in charge( not sure if he was the owner) rudely remarked us to leave the place!   The real test of customer service is when things don't work, and we found their behavior rude and unacceptable. We packed our bags and left the place immediately found another tent, Lake view camp, bang on the lake at half the price and great service.  Not recommended at all!",Nivedita B,/Profile/NiveditaB_13,"Mumbai, India",10
ladakh,"The beauty of Pangong Tso stuns you so much that everything else pales in comparison. Same thing is to be said about our stay at this Camp. This place is nicely set up quite close to the lake shore & is reasonably comfortable.   It was very cold & windy the day we reached so we could barely move around & spent most of our time within our tents. The tents have a double bed along with basic bathroom facilities & a backup torch. Given the geographical location, its not possible to have all sorts of comforts here. The lukewarm water is also procured through solar heaters.  But the service we received was nice & warm & so was the food. It was tasty & hot, just what we required for such weather. The Camp guys were also hands on in terms of service.  Overall it was a good experience",PriyankaMJ,/Profile/PriyankaMJ,"Bengaluru, India",30
ladakh,Pangong delight camp is one of the best place stay during full moon of night because its in spangmik form there you will get amazing view of lake. Over all this is camp is place to stay. Hope you will back again to visit this amazing lake to see in winter when it will be totally frozen.,r0ck99,/Profile/r0ck99,India,50
