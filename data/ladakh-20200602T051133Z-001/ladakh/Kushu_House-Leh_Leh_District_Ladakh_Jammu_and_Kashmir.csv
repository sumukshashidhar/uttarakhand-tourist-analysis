ladakh,What a lovely place this was. I mean it's not your typical luxury hotel but it's a small cosy one with great vibes and warm service. The room windows oook out to the beautiful views outside. Kushu has a big yard in front of it and I had literally spent hours looking at the mountain ranges infront. The food is simple yet delicious. Nurboo did a wonderful job guiding us in Ladakh and really took care of us while at Kushu. Atul was in touch throughout our stay and has done a great job with managing Kushu.Kudos to the team!,Gauravbatra94,/Profile/Gauravbatra94,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
ladakh,"Had a wonderful stay with the most wonderful people who gave us an insight into Ladakhi life! The moment we arrived, we were greeted with some local ginger lemon honey tea and amazing breakfast (also, they are flexible with check-in and check-out time). Perfect for those who are ready to live like a local in Leh. We visited Ladakh in October, Nurboo is the cutest and the most fun-loving driver cum guide you'll find in Ladakh, the staff is welcoming, friendly and conscientious. Thank you so much for making us feel home!",Manish Chandra Singh,/Profile/manishchandrasingh,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
ladakh,"A very impromptu suggestion by a friend who been here days ago proved to be correct. Greeted & bed/breakfast & a hearty staple meal taken care of by the lean & welltrained staff, notably Norbhu. Caretaker Atul S had a few useful suggestions for our remaining leg of the trip, by canceling our Khardung La & making Nubra Valley happen, again vide his network of B&B guesthouses like these.   Tip: Ask Norbhu to cook up Tibetan style chicken stew & potato-peas curry. There’s nothing more you’d want once back to this quiet abode.",Venus K,/Profile/889venusk,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"Mr.Atul is very kind and trustable man. You can ask something you need. My case, he arranged taxi for me to go to Pangong tso.  The location is about 10min from main vassal on foot. The room was very comfortable so you can relax.  Thanks for welcoming me! I'm sure I will stay there again if I will go Leh again!  ",維史 吉,/Profile/TrailBlazer716993,,50
ladakh,"We had a wonderful stay at Kushu house during July 2018. Atul helped us create an itinerary and booked hotels in Nubra and Pangong for us on our behalf.   Nurboo, our host at Leh was very warm and welcoming. He helped us zero down on the local sight seeing spots and arranged a taxi for us for 3 days at a rate lower than what was quoted by the taxi operators. He also arranged a pass for us to visit Nubra and Pangong.  The entire staff at Kushu is very warm and welcoming and did their best to make our stay warm and welcoming. Morning breakfast is decent and the cook made paranthas for us without a charge, even though the menu for that day was of bread omlette.  The rooms are of average size. Washrooms are clean with running water supply and provision for hot water. Overall, I find",Jtushar,/Profile/Jtushar,"Chandigarh, India",50
ladakh,"I would like to express my thanks and appreciation for the care and wonderful service at Kushu.. The staff really takes care of you. It was a much needed break, home away from home.. we requested for the upper room. The rooms are spacious and simple, bathrooms are clean. Food is home cooked and simply delicious. Icing on the cake is the view and having breakfast in the garden. And of course not to forget walking distance from the market. I had a wonderful time.   Thank you Atul and Nurboo,  Hope to visit Kushu soon.",samuelshefali,/Profile/samuelshefali,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
ladakh,"Had a great stay. The rooms are spacious, well maintained and very clean. Got to hear local stories and they suggested local things to do. The food was delicious and had the local flavour. The view of the mountains is breath taking and there is a lot of open space to chill.. wish i could have stayed longer..",bharat_madan10,/Profile/bharat_madan10,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"It is a nice home stay guest house, which is around a km from Market. The staff are very nice and giving excellent cooperation and service. The cook their own food and serves at any time. There is an open area in front of the rooms for relaxation. Budget hotel with comfort",tkssundaram,/Profile/tkssundaram,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",40
ladakh,"The main highlight is their staff. They are very friendly locals who make sure we are comfortable and well fed.  Breakfast ( Aalo paratha with pickle, Bread omelette, jam, butter and chocolate spread) and dinner ( Soup, Papad, vegetable salad, Roti, dal, sabzi, Rice and fruit salad) was complimentary. Plus they provide tea/ coffee with biscuits when asked for.  The place was neatly maintained and offered a pretty good wifi connection too. ",vidya sundaram,/Profile/vidyasundaram,"Chennai, India",50
ladakh,"Atul and Nurboo are wonderful people. Had a 2 nights stay and it was a wonderful experience. Kushu house is walking distance from the market. It is situated in the village where you can get first hand experience of locals doing farming. The views from the property are great, the rooms big with big windows, neat and clean, the bathrooms are also big. We had most of our meals at Kushu and they were very good. Hope to come back sometime soon and have this wonderful experience again. Keep it up guys :)",Visheshshourie,/Profile/Visheshshourie,India,50
ladakh,"Walking distance from the main market of Leh, Kushu holds on its own. It had a huge open space in front where they were tilling land for vegetables. The facade is traditional Ladakhi style while the amenities in it are all modern. The rooms are large and have big windows and the mountains greet you all day long. The Stok Kangri stands tall. The bathrooms are large too and are well kempt. The food is home cooked, simple and delicious. The best part of Kushu was its service. They really take care of you. Atul is a great host and so is Nurboo. The communication is crisp and they really help you out with your whole trip of Ladakh. My wife and I had a great time here. Will be back soon",Salim Islam,/Profile/salimislam,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
