ladakh,"We stayed at this hostel for 4 days prior to a hike, then another few days after. The hostel is an a quiet location not far from town. The breakfast jam sandwiches could be improved, but the chai was great. The hostel has a nice grass terrace area to socialise, and cheap laundry facilities. The staff were helpful and stored our things while we were away. There is a difference between rooms that are worth the same, so perhaps check once you arrive",Camille C,/Profile/camillecoleman,"Melbourne, Australia",50
ladakh,"Ree Hostel by Raybo is simply THE PLACE  for the most comfortable and fulfilling stay one can have in Leh. The hostel is at a perfect location  with a scenic view. It is clean and has all the basic amenities.   The place is lively and bustling with a very friendly and positive vibe. The hostel seems to draw a number of international tourists and conversing with people from all around the world added to our amazing experience.   The owners,the manager and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful and not just offered great tips on sighteeing in and around Leh but also helped us with hiring bikes and getting permits.   I'm more than happy and glad to have stayed at this hostel and to be taking back such amazing memories.I would definitely recommend this place to everyone",TDR,/Profile/Tarrahu,,50

ladakh,"This place looked better in the booking-app as it did it in real life. The concept is a mixture of youth hostel and hotel. We are no longer youth so the parties and laughing later at night didn‚Äôt fit very well to our scheme. The rooms are very basic, so is the breakfast. I assume this is a good place if you are at a budget and not 30+ yet.",Bowi72,/Profile/Bowi72,"Kriftel, Germany",30
ladakh,"Ree Hostel was quite a mixed bag. The accommodations themselves were very nice, and the rates were cheap. However, there were definitely mismanagement problems. Before leaving on a 2-night trek, we told reception that we would be back for another night's stay, and they confirmed that we could do so. Upon returning, they informed us they had no rooms available. In a similar vane, another guest told us that they were forced to move rooms at 10pm to accommodate another group of guests. It seems these types of problems could be prevented with some better management, but hopefully this will be worked out sooner rather than later - the hostel is still quite new and probably still learning.",Krogdor,/Profile/Krogdor,"Los Angeles, California",30
