ladakh,"We stayed there for one night, beautiful location, excellent resturant,Gorgeous rooms,very professional staff. Clear view of Lamayaru monastery. Walking distance from Lamayaru Monastery. Excellent view from the Resturant. The centre of attraction is the beautiful garden they maintained. I always recommend at least one night stay there on the way to Leh - Kargil.",raja123k0lkata,/Profile/raja123k0lkata,"Calcutta, West Bengal, India",50
ladakh,Firstly this is about Grand Moonland and not Moonland. This is a newly built hotel by the same group. The location is at a height from where you can see un hindered view of the mountains as also the Monastery. The view we got during sunset from the Hotel was amazing as the mountain in front got golden glow in the setting sun. From room balcony one can sit and enjoy the beauty.    The rooms are very much spacious and elegantly done. Staff is also very nice and cordial. They served us PIzza in the dinner and Pan cake during breakfast. This was never expected by us in Lamayuru. Infact all the travel agents I spoke to discouraged me not to stay at Lamayuru. However I wanted to stay one night to enjoy the lunar landscape.  We were all glad that our decision turned out to be perfect,hdg63,/Profile/hdg63,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,We stayed one night in Lamayuru on the way from Srinagar to Leh. Initially we were apprehensive as to what kind of Hotel we will get in Lamayuru as most of the travel agent discouraged us to stay at Lamayuru. We were pleasantly surprised on seeing how excellent the hotel was. It is newly constructed with very spacious rooms.   It is located on a hill side from where you can view practically whole of Lamyuru including the monastery. The evening sun reflects on the mountain on the front side of Hotel and the view is just amazing. From the room gallery also the view is very good and you can enjoy it.    Staff is very nice and polite. They gave us Pizza in Dinner among other regular food items. IN morning they also served us Pancake.   We were very much pleased with the short stay,hdg63,/Profile/hdg63,"Mumbai, India",50
