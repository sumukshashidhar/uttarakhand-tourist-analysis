ladakh,Stanzin and family were wonderful hosts.   We had most illuminating conversations with Stanzin and  learned so much about Ladakh from our brief stay! The food was totally amazing and the room was very comfortable with  most lovely view of the valley.   We will be coming back for sure!,joeli7,/Profile/lasermola,,50

ladakh,"Stanzin and his family are absolutely adorable ! The place is nice, quiet, clean and so charming... I almost felt like a member of his family ! I stayed first a few days and came back to explore the magnificent surroundings. Stanzin knows the valley in every details so I could explore and really feel the vibes of the mountains and the village. He is very helpful when it comes to organize a trek, and he is an experimented guide with whom you can go on adventures ! I just enjoyed every single minute at Old Likir and was very sad to leave the place but will definitely come back ! Thank you Stanzin for being such a delicate host ! See you soon :-)",Gal_Mfe,/Profile/Gal_Mfe,"Paris, France",50
ladakh,"I VISIT LADAKH SINCE 1978, and it has changed a lot since then. Lot of silly uneducated tourists takes the mountains as Disneyland. Leh has grown up to a noisy and polluted place. This is to say that if you wish to enjoy your stay Uou must visit Likir to find peace and beauty. STANZIN helos you in any way  he is anlso a experienced guide. His wife's food is delicious. Call for more info: 941 944 4010. You will return for sure !!!",tizianocalvi,/Profile/tizianocalvi,"Lugano, Switzerland",50
ladakh,"Visiting Likir in the winter is not only beautiful, but also less disturbing to tourists. The Old Likir Guest House is the best place to stay, except for the cleanliness and comfort of the rooms, the memorable local meals and, more importantly, the warmth of their service. Even more amazing is the fact that hot water baths are available even in cold winters.",MethokYin,/Profile/MethokYin,,50
ladakh,Really nice family and very helpful. They cooked everything for me and even brought food specially for me. Cooking was really nice and overall an amazing experience to stay with them. I wish i can return one day when its not so cold^^,Kostas V,/Profile/kostasv295,"Corfu, Greece",50
ladakh,"We visited Likir with friends this year in winter and stayed at this place.It is a perfect place to experience the Ladakhi flavour, enjoy the scenic beauty of the Ladakh Himalayan range from home, food, people and their lives.An authentic Ladakhi house which is situated near down the Likir Monastery and surrounded with beautiful Ladakh range which gives you a 360 degrease view from roof.The house and toilets are clean and we were always attended with most of our needs at any time.The best part is the host Stanzin, a simple, knowledgeable person with positive attitude who will make every possible way to provide you with his best and his family with whom you will have a homely stay.He took us for the nearby trekking in Likir and also to Ulley and Hemis.We we’re lucky to be the",Shatabdi,/Profile/shatabdiz,,50

ladakh,"We reached Likir on a really cold evening of wintery Ladakh...that turned to the warmest welcome one can expect when entering Old Likir guesthouse-homestay. A very nice and friendly family, good traditional meals, confortable and clean rooms and toilet and really charming details as small electric heater in the room (already turned on when we came inside) or lukewarm water bucket in toilet on waking-up time (without even ask for it). This guesthouse is simple as a traditional ladakhi home is, but this is in fact what makes this place great and luxurious for visitors like us who want to live and understand the countries and cultures where we are travelling in. About Stanzin, the owner, he is also a good freelance guide that knows and loves Ladakh ans specially Sham area (where",trescaelsmons,/Profile/trescaelsmons,"Barcelona, Spain",50
ladakh,"When I arrived at Likir gomba, my driver said that pls don't go down, there is a drunk man. But, I was the most unlucky man on that day. That guy bla bla too much and want to be my trek guide, too bad.  After all, I love lovely kids there, the father and the wife are friendly.",David P,/Profile/davidpT5333IF,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",10
ladakh,"As a confirmation for previous feedback from ShantiP84, the host was really unprofessional, especially when he is drunk. We arrived in Likir when the village was having a wedding party and after the host came back home from it, he became a different person, more talkative and pushy about his tour to Ulley, and kept asking us to go with him to another party that night, despite our denial since we have a long trek to Yangthang next morning. I guess we are, again, another “unlucky” couples who ran into him on a bad day when he had family problems.  Even though the room was good, with great view and clean, and his wife was a good cook and his kids were so friendly, we feel so sorry for a stay that could have been great memories but then turned to annoyance and even threatening.",pvycao,/Profile/pvycao,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",30
ladakh,The Average rating is for the home stay which was clean & the family of the host who was very simple and good. The food provided was also delicious. The surroundings of the guest house is also super.My husband & me had planned stay for 2 nights at the guest house to attend Likir Monastery festival and then move ahead with Mr Stanzin our host for the trek from Likir to Yangthang & further to Ulley. The Monastery festival was fabulous. But due to Unprofessional behaviour & attitude of the host Mr Stanzin (would not like to mention in detail) we could not continue our trek as planned & had to return to Leh after the festival. Our total plan went offboard because of the host and had to reschedule everything on our own. Would not recommend the host to consider as guide for any trek,Shanti P,/Profile/ShantiP84,"Mumbai, India",30
ladakh,"I stayed with Stanzin and his family back in april/may 2017, the homestay/ nearby monastery life was an amazing experience, with fantastic treks just above the likkir monastery with breathtaking himalayan views, we ran into a couple of mediation outposts where monks go on retreat... he also took me to the remote village of tar, a  definite highlight for my 4 months in india! I'll definitely come back one day...in summer next time! although april is less touristy! highly recommended!",Morgan R,/Profile/MorganR1023,"Mangawhai, New Zealand",50
ladakh,"One of the best experience in my life. A greatful landscape just in front of the window, the silence that only Hymalaia can offer and the kindness of a traditional ladakhi family make this place perfect to escape the noise in wich we are use to live. Stanzin, the owner, is also a trekking and expeditions guide, this and the fact that the guest house is situated exactly in the beginning part of the ""Sham Trek"" make very easy to start from there for an amazing walking-tour of Ladakh. Full-rates approved!",Alessandro P,/Profile/D5499RYalessandrop,,50
ladakh,It was the third time we stayed at Stanzin's place. As always we again felt at home in that shivering cold also. Stanzin took us to the nearest meditation hut and showed the whole Likir village. Playing with his three lovely kids and meeting his 89 yrs old grandmother were added treat.,Sucheta1976,,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"Another year but at a different time, in the time of Ladakhi new year. It was another great stay and I would say the homestay now looks even better with it's facilities of clean toilet. We had a great trekking experience with the host Stanzin in the Sham valley, specially at Hemis Shukpachan, Rizong monastery, Ulley village etc. Enroute we saw some old and heritage meditation centres, which used to be occupied by the great leaders of Gelugpa sect and founder of Rizong monastery. Would love to be back here again in green summer months.",d_Jishnu,,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"I was so pleased to be a guest in the house of Stanzin. I learned a lot about the life of the locals, the beautiful treks in Ladakh. I had a very nice room, delicious meals and got a lot of helpful information for my self guided trek. Stanzin is as well a very experienced guide and another week we did the very beautiful trek from Lamayuru to Stok with homestays. I only can recommend this experience.",s0mmers0n,,"Zurich, Switzerland",50
ladakh,"It's been twice we have visited this beautiful place, nestled in the Ladakh Range at 3700 meters (~12500 feet), just below the Old Likir Monastery. This place has a unique Ladakhi flavour. The amicable and knowledgeable nature of the owner, Stanzin made us felt at home with this home stay immediately. He has good knowledge about the Ladakhi heritage and the monastic culture, the wild life around this area. The owner also offers Treks and Expeditions around this area, and is always helpful with all the information. Being in this peaceful place and roaming around the village, taking small hikings in the nearby mountains, old solitary meditation centres - all these are an experience in itself.",d_Jishnu,,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",50
