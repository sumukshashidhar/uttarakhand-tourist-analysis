The hospitality is just awesome. if you love north indian food, you will become fan of the cook. Attenders are doing their job so good.

ladakh,"I camped here for a night in June 2017. Everything around and inside the camps gave a fresh new look. Very comfortable,clean & cozy tents they have. The food offered was great and in large portions. They arranged a bonfire at night for our group, which was a great experience under the star lit sky and the beautiful surroundings this place has. The owner and the staff guys are really nice and warm hearted people.They allowed to use their mobile phones as mine (Bloody-IDEA) wasnt working which speaks of the kind hospitality they offer. Definitely worth a visit without a second thought. Looking forward to have a call from Hunder to visit again soon :)",sudhirjainz,/Profile/sudhirjainz,"Ludhiana, India",50
ladakh,"Nestled among scenic mountains in the Hunder village of Nubra valley, is the newly started Paramount Camp, inviting and comforting the tired mountain traveler. The location of the camp is convenient, being close to the main tourist attraction - the Nubra desert camel rides - and about 40 minutes by road from Diskit (Maitreya Buddha).  I was amazed by the cleanliness and the comfort offered by the tents in the camp - which had clean beds, well maintained bathrooms and hot water made available in the morning.   Owned by an elderly ex-Army officer - whom one can see at the camp on his morning walks - who is hands-on in his approach to running the place, I found the staff to be very courteous and helpful. The manager - a local - also was very helpful and gave a lot of information",VandV2015,/Profile/VandV2015,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"We were on a long tour of Leh for about 15 days and wanted to take each place in a relaxed and leisurely way. Hence we had reserved 3 nights for Nubra, when we booked our tour through our Agent Trip India Hotels. We were given a choice of  many camps to choose from and we are glad with the choice we made.  We found the staff very helpful, always going that extra mile to make you feel at home. Food is nice and the tents are clean. Hot water was available when needed.  Paramount is a new Camp and it is very professionally maintained with utmost care taken of every small little thing.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Paramount---- It is truly Paramount..  Highly Recommended...",TripIndiaHotels1,/Profile/TripIndiaHotels1,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,I visited Nubra with my friends this month and stayed in Paramount Camp at Hunder. It is near the sand dunes and situated on the main road. People working here always keep smiles on their face. Services are excellent. Rooms are good. good space for parking. They have small activities also for Kids.,vipulkhanna41,/Profile/vipulkhanna41,"New Delhi, India",50
