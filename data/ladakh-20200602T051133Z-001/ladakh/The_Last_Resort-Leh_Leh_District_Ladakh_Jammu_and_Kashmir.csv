ladakh,The Last Resort's is located out of Leh but with views of the mountains above Leh and to the west can be seen the Spituk monastery. A short walk through through the grassed area adjoining the communal areas leads to the fast flowing Indus although cattle were able to wade across it on our visit. We were exceedingly well looked after and staff were very attentive and solicitous. The meals were scrumptious and there was a dangerous tendency to overeating! Nothing was too much for our hosts!  The site is promoting sustainable tourism and the tents were comfortable. Being at the end of the tourist season the temperatures dropped at evening but the tent was cosy.  I believe motor-bikes can be rented from the premises.   Located down a dirt track away from the road leading to Spituk.,David S,/Profile/davidsI6297QS,"Romsey, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,"Went there with friends couple of times.Hopefully visiting there again.  This place is a perfect getaway from the hustle and bustle of the Leh main city.Its on the bank of river Indus. #Beautiful sunsets with the view of Spituk monastery. They have very cozy tents ⛺ and staff are very friendly and welcoming.  Foods they serve as per our own wish. They have a beautiful lawn with music system and bonfire. Perfect for friends, family and especially for solo travellers because they have very huge property where no one can notice you.",Chosdol,/Profile/Chosdol,,50
ladakh,"We stayed here at the beginning of our trip to Ladakh, and for a further few nights through the tour. The tent was spacious and clean and firmly anchored to the ground, especially reassuring when there were some high winds. The tents had their own facilities with hot water being solar powered. Toiletries were provided too. The grounds of The Last Resort are extensive and lead to the river Indus, a lovely peaceful walk. The food was plentiful and freshly cooked. Eggs were offfered for breakfast, along with toast and jam. The lemon ginger honey tea was most refreshing after a long day out. It is important to take everything very slowly when first arriving in Leh, as the altitude is significant. We were extremely well looked after by our tour leader and the staff here. It was great.",aco7907,/Profile/aco7907,essex,40
ladakh,It’s really a last resort away from the hustle and bustle of Leh. It’s close to the river and has a silent atmosphere to unwind and have a more peaceful time off.  We absolutely enjoyed the delicious home cooked meals offered by the owners mom.,Karthik Govind,/Profile/karthik_govind_sg,"Eindhoven, The Netherlands",50
ladakh,"We stayed here for 2 days with family. You can call it a resort or a hotel. The owner has thought through well before building this place. Whoever is visiting leh, they need 2 days to acclimatize. When you land in leh, they say 24 hours but i recommend 48 hours with minimal pgysical activity. Thr last resort is a high end tent so you feel close to nature and the place will accelerate acclimatisation. Food is really out of the world. It is home cooked food which is rare to get. For exampls, they have home made pickle, organic honey and they ask your preference before preparing the food. I suggest you go with their recommendations as they know what to prepare for the climate",ilovefood,/Profile/alwayshungry08,"Bangkok, Thailand",50
ladakh,"Location: The Last Resort is the perfect place to acclimatize during the first two days of your Ladakh trip. The resort is surrounded by the extremely breathtaking landscape. I was marvelled by the beauty of mountains, clear blue skies and the stream of Indus river that flows near the resort. The classic wallpaper in reality. The resort is 20 min drive from the Leh airport as well as the Leh market.  Food:  The food was great. I loved Aloo Parathas.The dining area was great.  Rooms & Staff :  I found the design of tents really unique. The owner and resort staffs were hospitable. The tents can be improvised further.  Overall it was an awesome stay.",Rameshwari S,/Profile/208rameshwaris,,40

But that is only last for few hours and then the trip starts to leh. Great road. Keep moving along side the valley.  Nice camps here at last resort. And with bonfire.",Kovid S,/Profile/kovids85,,50

ladakh,"I was at this place to take a long break, and trust me this was the best decision I took. The place is very close to the Leh Airport, yet far away from the hustle and bustle of city life. Situated on the banks of River Indus, its ideal for acclimatising in Leh before continuing with your plan to travel in Ladakh. The biggest charm of this place is the  service quality, the delicious food and the cozy huts. Leh market is just a 20 minutes drive from here. I would definitely recommend anybody who is travelling to Leh to check out this place, even if its for a night, and enjoy this untroubled and serene place in the lap of nature.",Neelabh16,/Profile/Neelabh16,,50

ladakh,"I booked this resort for one night initially and my husband said no we want all three nights in same place. When we came to Last Resort, my husband and our friends refused to stay there, however, last night of our stay in Leh we stayed there as no other accommodation was available - and then everyone just loved this place. They have bed warmers and you get super comfortable sleep after rough drives of Ladakh. The food was excellent - Aloo pyaz ke paranthe were superhit!

This is the only resort at Leh, though it is situated a bit away from the main Leh city, the resort has beautiful mountains all around and has a spectacular view of the whole city.

ladakh,"The place gives you the warmth that you need in the cool weather. From staff to rooms, that make u feel cozy and comfortable to the extent that you do not want to come back. Leh would never have been amazing if it wasnt for this place. They help you acclimatize and slowly sink in to the nature that is all around u. View to the beautiful valleys, mountains and the Indus that flows by is breath taking. The last resort is the place to choose. They help with arranging places to see and trust me they have best of people to take u around.

ladakh,"We as a family were very curious to know how our resort will be, especially upon learning that it is like a camp on the riverside. It is a short drive from the airport and the steep bends and curves doubled our excitement. We were thrilled to be there surrounded by tall poplars and magnificent view of the mountains. We received a warm welcome and were shown around the place by the staff, later they helped us to tea and yummy breakfast soon after the resort tour. The room was cozy and I loved the view from the door. It looked out into the valley of Leh with the majestic mountains in the backdrop. It was indeed cold there, but there were bed warmers and they kept us warm throughout the night.

ladakh,"Leh was always on my bucket list, but given the birth of my daughter and a very bad experience once in the mountains, I was circumspect. After a lot of thinking and a bit of persuasion by the Atul (Owner, Last Resort), I packed my bags and took the entire clan along. (3 year old to 65 years old)  Nestled in the lowest point in Leh ( A few hundred feet), Last resort is a luxury camping set up, that is suited for one and all. Situated right at the banks of the river, this 100-acre property is a solace from the hustle and bustle of the city. Yet, it is close to the airport (20 mins).  As we got down from Leh airport, the first thing you notice is the lack of oxygen at about 11,500 feet above Sea-Level,  Flat Plain lubbers will feel that extra pressure in those lungs.

ladakh,"Perhaps one of the truest emotion is being one with nature. A place that looks like a stunning wallpaper in the highest resolution interacting with you. It invokes a feeling so powerful it is easy to get overwhelmed. That's precisely what this neat little resort on hills does to you. Surrounded by mountains, streams, woods, it is such a beautiful place with it's own unique identity. An identity which blends with nature engulfing all around it. Everything inside the tent is made with untreated, unshaped wood. The view outside is like standing on the edge of horizon.  The woods which is the part of the resort welcomes you with open arms offering the purest water in the stream with indigenous trees growing aplenty besides it.

ladakh,"We visited Leh in July-27, booked through Ghoomleh.com.This resort is some distance from the city centre (8km), located on a sprawling property along the banks of the river Indus. The scenic beauty is breathtaking - sunrise and sunset both spectacular. I was a little apprehensive about staying in tents given the temperature drops at night, however, this turned out to be a very comfortable experience. The rooms and bathrooms are clean and spacious. There is running hot water which we realized was a luxury. Must mention the Hospitality - there was no vodafone network and we were distraught when we reached as we were unable to make any contact with anybody. The resort staff was kind enough to lend us one of their spare sims for the period of our stay. Food was also really good. ",Pallavi_Nagia,/Profile/Pallavi_Nagia,"Bengaluru, India",50
