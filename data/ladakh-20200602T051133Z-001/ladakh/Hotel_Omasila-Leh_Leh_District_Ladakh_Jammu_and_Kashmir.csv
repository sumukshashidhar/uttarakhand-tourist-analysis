ladakh,One of the best hotel to stay in leh. the location of hotel is perfect with just 15 mins walk from main market. All the staff are very courteous & helpful. the view from the room in amazing with snow clad mountains in background. Buffet breakfast & dinner is good . The best part of the hotel is its garden. The garden has good seating arrangement where you can take sunbath in cold winters of leh.

ladakh,"Its hard to assess a place to stay in a new tourist destination. We took a chance and luckily booked in advance at Hotel Omasila. This place has a lovely sun-deck overlooking the snow-capped mountains, reasonably well-appointed rooms and hot water in the bath. The restaurants offer excellent cuisine and offer great service too. We had friends and family from overseas and we unanimously agreed this was the right place to be! The owner Nawang is a friendly and helpful person. His team is always ready to serve with a smile. A lovely place to stay in Leh. Personally, I wish they remove the clutter of furniture from the rooms. Excellent house-keeping too!",rajranch,/Profile/rajranch,ranchi,40

One of our collegues got ill during the stay and they made every effort to ensure that we had a good trip in lah. They served us hot ginger watre, medicine and even food as per our choice just to ensure that we are fine. There is one lil fat lady there who does all the work like room cleaning to room service and from cooking to gardening. she was very warm and kind to us.  Those who fear that in ladakh they might not get good food should stay in Omasila. they served hot and excellent buffet everyday.

ladakh,"travelled with my family to Leh. Hotel Omasila is a nice family run small hotel which is a great place to stay. never experienced more helping and courteous staff in my entire travelling all over the world.  the hotel is located about 1 km from downtown one can easily walk to the downtown, rem the city itself is only 2-3 km in length.  due to extreme climatic conditions in Leh, piped water is really a luxury and this hotel does have piped water during the summer months,. again due to remote location, power supply is erratic, which is not required as heating is entirely done by gas stoves.   try the suites on the upper levels for excellent views.",MKSaifullah,/Profile/MKSaifullah,"Chennai, India",40

ladakh,"Stayed here for 2 nights based on Tripadvisor recommendations. Firstly, our experience here was perhaps marred by a traveling group of around 50 staying at the hotel and my high expectation considering that this is rated #1 for Leh hotels (at the moment, May 2011).  The room given to us was in the new wing, adjacent to the sit-outs, because all other rooms were occupied. The room itself was not cleaned for quite a while, with a layer of dust on all the furniture.   After this got sorted out, we ran into a problem of food at dinner. The dinner was prepared only for the group, and had nothing local in it. Knowing this was disastrous, we asked them to arrange for separate food at our rooms, which they did.   The room was looking out to the Shanti Stupa and didn't have a good view",the_0ne,/Profile/the_0ne,"New York City, New York",20
ladakh,"I stayed at the Omasila for over a week in February.  It was one of the highlights of my trip to Ladakh, purely because of the very warm welcome given to me by Nawang and his fantastic and helpful team.  Nothing was too much trouble.  It was freezing cold outside, yet my room was cosy thanks to an enormous gas heater in one corner - and we had endless supplies of masala chai, hot water in buckets for washing and hot water bottles at night.  I also had a great view of the mountains from my room.  The food was fabulous.  The hotel is only a short walk out of town along a pretty poplar lined road - and therefore very quiet at night.  I cannot rate the Omasila more highly and I cannot thank Nawang enough for making my stay in Leh so enjoyable.",Katie G,/Profile/WalmerWanderer,"London, United Kingdom",50

We got this curry type dish that was made with pumkin locally grown, truly tasty... Staff where great too. Couple of times electricity would go but was quickly sorted. I think its like this in Leh anyway with few min power cuts.

Going from the hotel to Leh takes about 5-7 minutes as it is nearly downhill all the way. Coming back in the other direction it takes about 10-12 minutes or so because it is uphill.  All members of staff, from the manager to the cleaners and room and breakfast staff at this hotel without exception literally bent over backwards to facilitate me and made my stay in Leh a happy and memorable one.

A previous review says the restaurant is not great. In all honesty, they don't even claim to be a ""restaurant"" - they call it a ""dining room"" and we were quite impressed by the simple, but tasty food. Meals are very reasonably priced, and a couple of evenings, when we were too tired to walk down and get a meal at a restaurant, we ate the buffet dinner.

Rather than rush me through registration, Mr Tsering the manager let me take my time and wash first before completing the formalities. Simple acts of courtesy like this marked my whole stay at the hotel. I originally intended to stay only three nights and ended up staying seven due to a fall in which I fractured my heel. There was a constant stream of people in the hotel and I'm sure my unexpectedly extended stay must have been an inconvenience, but no one said a word to me about moving out.  In fact it was Mr. Tsering who came to the hospital, waited while a cast was put on, filled my prescription for me before driving me back to the Omasila.

The people are friendly and the staff is just perfect - helpful without being in your face.  They arrange for reliable taxis to take you on day/overnight trips.  The one thing we loved about Ladakh in general is that the natives are not out to take you for a ride...that 'gimme, gimme' attitude is almost non-existent except in some tourist traps.

The hotel was nice and the first floor room had a fantastic view of snowcapped mountains. The view alone compensates for many things. However, the first floor rooms are not centrally heated (unlike what the website says). Please do check for this if you need heating at 10 degree c. That made our stay quite tough. The hotel was helpful enough to provide a heater but it looked and felt prety risky with its own gas cylinder.

The beds and blankets were good.   In winter the temprature drops sharply to minus. In November 2nd week it was minus 4 C. So you need a good heater. They supplied a gas burning heater which is a very good heater. Heats up the room very quickly. However if the smell of the heating it produces doesn't agree with you then you might get head aches like I did. It was difficult fo me. We had to keep the windows open for ventilation.
