Servers and Staff were really polite and sweet. Breakfast was Good, Dinner was Convincingly OK , wont point out anything wrong in breakfasts and dinners as nothing major or remarkable went wrong. Hot Showers were the best part of my stay. Hahah, Even though the hot water was for few hours but i guess those hours were right, nothing odd about them. Access to all TV channels was again a plus point. Even if you want to chill in your room, have some drinks and put some music on it full-filled our desire.

It‚Äôs a quaint rustic group of cabins where heat and hot water are available for 4 hours in the morning and the evening as long as those times correspond with your travel schedule. An investment in cheap window screens would go far to keep them out of your room and especially off your food in the dining hall. There was no safe in the room and there were a few toiletries only.

ladakh,"The resort is located at the outskirts of Leh and can only be reached if you have pre-arranged transport as I don't think there is any public transport that plys this area.  It is supposedly a resort within a small village community but there is really nothing on offer in the area except what the resort offers, which is nothing much except peace and quiet in a tranquil environment.  The resort is made up of  individual single story buildings where the rooms are located. There is a dinning building where all meals are served. Other than this there are no other amenities that one commonly associates with a resort.  The rooms are adequately furnished with quite comfy beds.

They are extremely friendly and made us feel welcome from the get go.   This hotel is about 6-7 km outside Leh which is a good thing because of the Diesel smell in Leh due to the number of cars in the area.   We had only made partial reservations and had just briefly discussed the details but upon reaching there, George personally arranged the whole trip for us.

While the staff tried hard, they really didn't know what they were doing and frustrated me throughout my stay.  They were perfectly nice, but consistently failed to deliver.  Nothing major to ruin my time in Leh, but some small examples: when they decided to play music at the restaurant they chose Christmas music in August; the restaurant has no menu or prices and, while they asked me to come up with what I wanted, they eventually just steered the conversation to the dish they had for that meal (often an odd melange of western, Indian, and Chinese food on the same plate), sometimes delivering food I",Elms54,/Profile/Elms54,"Islamabad, Pakistan",30

ladakh,"One of the best experiences of my life. A great decision to stay at Saboo. Thanks to TripAdvisor for the ratings. I relied on it and proud to declare that the hotel is a unique experience in its own. The owner of the resort is a gem of a person. Both the brothers, Peter and George, made our stay as homely as possible Their attention to detail, personalized service blended with a great staff made us feel awesome. In five days, we landed up being good friends for life. Food is made to order. In fact, they don't believe in menus. You choose what you want to eat and they will take the pain to get that prepared. Never had I seen such an amazing hospitality. Hats off. Also, let me mention that my son had a great time with two of their pet dogs.

Not only is the staff friendly and helpful, but the owner George will go above and beyond to meet your needs. The food is great, the facilities are exactly what you need and the location can not be beaten.

The rooms are quite exquisitely designed, modern and yet so homely and comfortable. The food is amazingly fresh and tasteful, especially the the homemade apricot jam which you must try with warm freshly toasted bread for breakfast. The friendly staff and chef and very capable of catering to special needs on request. The resort property is vast, spacious and located in the middle of lovely scenic mountains, which make you feel like they are watching over you morning to night.

ladakh,We visited Leh from 12th-17th August 2015. We landed early morning and were received well at the airport. This resort is outside of Leh town and is mesmerizing. We were welcomed by the resort staff who pinned a sash on our clothes with their resort name which was fantastic. The rooms and bathrooms were outstanding and in the middle of the mountains and beautiful skies. We were offered a tour of Nubra Valley and one night accommodation via Khardungla Pass which was breath taking. The food was excellent and our stay comfortable.

ladakh,"If you are going to Leh, Saboo resort is a must. 7kms away from the main city its perfect if you like it to be quiet and non-touristy. The rooms are very comfortable with a beautiful view. There are many lovely walks you can do around Saboo and the market is nice 7km bike ride away. George and his team make the experience even more enjoyable because of their warmth and hospitality. George is the best guide and adviser you can find in Ladhak. The food is very good. Eating a meal on the roof top is a must. If you are an internet addict their is wifi in the reception.

ladakh,"Firstly thank you to Peter George and all his staff for looking after me so well. I stayed 19 and 20 August and 23, 24, 25th.  Loved my bedroom and adjoining relaxing room plus the new bathroom (with its herbal soaps) was above my expectation. Sooooo comfortable a bed and very good quality bed linen and very soft towels.  One of my friends was so impressed with the Resort when she came to visit (and had dinner) that she has now recommended Saboo to quite a few other people and stayed there at least once herself.  I was very spoilt with the food at dinner (being asked earlier in the day what I would like). Breakfast is my least favourite meal of the day, but Peter's mother made this wonderful traditional bread (in the hot coals I think) that with butter,  apricot jam  or honey",Alpacafleece,/Profile/Alpacafleece,"Sydney Olympic Park, Australia",50

Area near resort is very calm, quiet and relaxed. # Dining service is good. They will serve you tasty and healthy food surely. # Rooms are clean and well maintained. # Laundry service also much faster (most of the time they deliver clothes in 12 hrs.) # All staff is polite and well behaved. # they have wifi facility only in main entrance area. I was not too happy when I got to know this on my first day, but they have taken a good decision. After visit to Ladakh and Saboo I really got to know how much we are addicted to the internet, and we are losing our small small talks, games, social life which I found in starry nights and cloudy days.   ?

ladakh,"Saboo Resorts is located in Saboo village, 7 km (15 minute drive) from the centre of Leh town. The picturesque location is surrounded by farms and poplar trees, and has snow-capped mountains in the distance.  The place is very clean and well-maintained, with a dining hall, a lounge cum office, and even a gurgling stream passing through it. There's plenty of open ground for kids to run about.  Wi-Fi is available only in the dining hall, and rightly so, because as the resort owner puts it, ""you'll never step out of your rooms otherwise!"".  The rooms themselves are luxurious and nicely built, with comfortable beds and a lovely balcony. Satellite TV is included.

ladakh,"Being a frequent traveler to Leh, Saboo Resorts was one of our best finds this year. Hidden near the mountains about 20 kms from Leh, the resort offers a great offbeat Ladakhi experience. The rooms are more like independent cottages with wooden feel on the inside with all modern facilities, but have a rustic look of a Ladakhi house from the outside. What i really liked was the use of Poplar wood in a conventional way to build the insides giving it an actual Ladakhi house feel, along with a sit down area outside the room but still mainting the 'sheekness' of a luxury stay.  Service quality was prompt and upbeat, with smiling Ladakhi faces always there for anything you need.
