ladakh,"Locality: Situated at a Good locality and well accessible via Road.  Staff: Best in Class, I can say. will support and serve you in a best possible way.  Food: Quality Food as per Leh conditions. Better to take suggestions from the staff regarding Food as they know the conditions (climate) very well.  Internet: Slow as compared to metro of India. Don't expect, a greater speed.  Service: Ever ready to serve you, don't expect exceptional things as Leh itself situated at 10500 Ft. But whatever you will pay you will receive more than that. I can assure, you will be satisfied   Staff Behavior:BEST (Shan, Aamir, Owner uncle and the Cook Aunty and all other). No one will let you down.  Cloth Cleaning: Available (Paid)  Parking:NO  Rental Bike: Assistance available:  Cleanness:",Pranaya Kumar,/Profile/pranayanita,"Hyderabad, India",50
ladakh,"In giving 5 stars within the context of leh hotels. The hotel isn't perfect, but the owner is so friendly and helpful that the problems common to leh hotels have to be overlooked.   The rooms are quite pleasant (compared to what I saw in other hotels / guest houses in the village).   The location is good, near the main square and lots of restaurants. The back of the hotel is much quieter than the front, and of course the views from the back side are much better. I liked room 302, windows on two sides and snow top mountain views.   The showers run hot early morning and evening.   The staff are kind and helpful, they helped me out (I arrived in leh sick, having picked up a bug in Delhi).   The owner (Afzal) used to be a trekking guide and gave a lot of good local info for free",Bob B,/Profile/bobb338,Seoul,50
ladakh,"Been staying here for a few years now. The staff are great and the location is fantastic. Very close to some great restaurants, but still quiet enough to relax. The owner will organize tours for you, book taxis etc. Very hospitable.",ben s,/Profile/stephensonben,"Calgary, Canada",50
ladakh,"Booked this hotel after going through tripadvisor reviews..however was in rude shock.apart from the location there is nothing good to say reg this hotel. We were assured a room by 12 afternoon n informed the manager that our bags our left at its premises & leaving for sightseeing. .on returning in the eve (super tired) we are informed that they erroneously gave our room to someone else. We were made to wait for over a hour to be given a room that was a disaster from horrendous smells,torn carpet and dirt all over. Since it was nearly 10pm and we had an early itinerary we had no choice. We checked out the next day n headed to nubra valley and were assured a better room and all together since we were a group. On returning again we were given seperate rooms and the Western toilet",Melissa R,/Profile/U9939TZmelissar,,10
ladakh,"I travelled to Ladakh with a friend to carry out research this summer and the owner, his son and all of the staff made us feel very at home. We had some great chats and learned a lot about the local area too. They also helped us to plan trips to Pangong lake and other villages outside of Leh. Changspa Road is also close to the shops just down the road, restaurants near by, and a short walk from the Shanti stupa, which gives you wonderful views over the whole of Leh. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Hotal Mehak.",Kirsty F,/Profile/182kirstyf,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",50

ladakh,"I just drop by this hotel while walking along with the street to find to stay near the center of Leh which means I didn't have any idea about the Mehak before through internet or something else. Me and my friends were so tired so we decided to stay here just because it's really close to the center. Now, I thank god so much to made me find this hotel.  People who are working there are so amazing. They are kind,nice,helpful,gentle! What can I do say anymore. I swear you don't need to hesitate more to book it or not.  We don't have any plan in Leh and after Leh. They helped to make it and actually made it everything for us!  Such a reliable people!  Just go and spend time with here then you know what I want to say.  Especially to Korean(I'm Korean).  You can feel like in Korea when",Sora J,/Profile/SoraJ31,,50
ladakh,Recently stayed at Mehak Hotel. Hotel is in a great location (right in the middle of town) and a good quality room for the price. The owner was very helpful sorting out any issues we had while at his hotel. Wireless as available which we weren't expecting.  ,Toby C,/Profile/tobyc250,,50
ladakh,"Just spent the last 3 days here with two friends, and would easily stay again. Hospitality was awesome, the manager in particular helped us with all of our problems, and made our stay very comfortable. Breakfast and room were great as well, and the location was perfect for getting around Leh. You would struggle to find a better place at the price! Thanks for a great stay ",Alex L,/Profile/alex_f_lee,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,I stayed here in May 2013 (I chose October 2013 as tripadvisor does not allow me to select an older date). Been a long time since I wanted to write this review. I stayed at this hotel as part of a package offered by Cox and Kings. The hotel is pretty close to the market. The owner is very helpful and so are the staff. My son experienced acute stomach ache and vomiting in Leh. The owner helped me a lot during this time - asking his staff to drive me to the pharmacy as well as the hospital in Leh. Leh has a power cut problem and hence hot water is available at limited times. We should understand this and not hold this as a negative against the hotel (or any hotel in Leh). The staff obliged by cooking maggi etc for my kids. We were also provided evening tea and biscuits every day,KRS,/Profile/srirraja,Chennai,40
