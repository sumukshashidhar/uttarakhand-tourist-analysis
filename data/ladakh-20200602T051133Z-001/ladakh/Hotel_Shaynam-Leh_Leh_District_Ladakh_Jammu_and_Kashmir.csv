ladakh,"We loved staying at Hotel Shaynam!  The rooms are neat and clean , with hot water and power back up.  Service and food was excellent, the owners are so warm and welcoming and friendly. I totally recommend people to stay at this cozy little place in Leh , just 5 min walk from the main market ! Would love to go back again !",Menaka T,/Profile/MenakaT6,,50
ladakh,I have been using this hotel since 2009 and the owner and staff are still the same and very welcoming. It is well situated to work into the city centre and for walking out to a restaurant in the evening. Leh is becoming progressively busier so rooms facing on to the road can be noisy (especially now there is a rubbish collection cart that does the rounds about 6 a.m.!) but you do get used to it and noise is a feature of the majority of Leh hotels.  Facilities are basic but clean and hot water is always there for the asking.  The nicest bit is sitting in the courtyard with the lovely plants and relaxing.  There is Wifi but connectivity in Leh generally is pretty intermittent so it doesn't always work!,Sally L,/Profile/702sallyl,"Richmond, United Kingdom",40
ladakh,"This hotel is around 10 mins drive from Leh Airport. From outside, it looks very ordinary place. After crossing the reception, the hotel has a nice green courtyard with flowers and apple tree, which in fact becomes surprise to the guests. The rooms are big, neat and clean. The bathrooms are specious as well. The hotel terrace offers a nice snow mountain view.  The service is good. Over-all very satisfying experience.",indian302,/Profile/indian302,"Hyderabad, India",40
ladakh,Very good property at budget price. Excellent location walkable from leh market. Comfortable rooms with 24 hours hot water. A lawn area with seats for relaxing. Owner Ringchain is a very friendly man who provided very good support and also made cab arrangements. He was also kind enough to send oxygen cylinders for pangong trip. We stayed there for 4 nights and happy to recommend to both families and individuals looking for an affordable option.,sekharmalyala,/Profile/sekharmalyala,"Chennai, India",40
ladakh,"The hotel is located on the mail leh road, in the very beginning.. close to airport and main market area. Though it is a very small homestay kind of hotel with 15-20 rooms, it offers a home like comfortable stay. Owner is very helpful in providing all required information for navigation in leh-ladakh... from a day of relax breaks.. to taking medicines for high altitude (dimox) ...taking light food on 1st day and so on. Staff too is very good. It also offers rooms for group bookings etc.",nitsyy,/Profile/nitsyy,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"We went for a week in the begining of may to ladakh and as most of you wont know this timing is every cold over there and like us you might have to ask for extra blankets. Hotel staff are very quick with room service and if you want like us when we had to wait for our taxi, you can soak morning sun in the garden like my parents did. Met friendly tourists too. It is at a good location with all resturants and cafeteria nearby!! ",Uditi C,/Profile/UditiC,,50

ladakh,"Hotel Shaynam is located at old road.Fair price compared to other hotels in Leh. We stayed during April 2016. Mr Rinchen was more than welcoming.Although the rooms appeal simple they are quite relaxing. You get to see the clear blue sky and mountains from the hotel. One can also see Shanti Stupa located at the top. Overall we had a delightful stay. Thanks Mr Rinchen, keep up the good service !!!",Slimshadddyyy,/Profile/Slimshadddyyy,"Ahmedabad, India",40

We took taxi also from the hotel itself, our driver Padma was also awesome.",alwayrsimi,/Profile/alwayrsimi,"Ahmedabad, India",50
ladakh,Hotel shaynam is a good option to stay in Leh at affordable price compared to other 3-star hotels. The location is on a street with buzzing traffic. The garden is good and so are the rooms. Comfortable bedding. Mr rinchen was courteous enough and the service is good. The dining hall is really good with excellent breakfast and dinner options in buffet. Overall a nice hotel.,Pratik Nachane,/Profile/334pratikn,"Mumbai, India",40

ladakh,"Very handily situated for walking in to town this is a small, family run, hotel which has had the same staff since I first visited in 2009!  They are all most attentive and helpful.  Rooms are spacious and most are ensuite.  The hotel is built around three sides of a quadrangle and there is a lovely outside garden/seating area which is particularly nice. Washing lines on the roof can come in very  handy for drying laundry!",Sally L,/Profile/702sallyl,"Richmond, United Kingdom",40
ladakh,"the rooms are awesome, the service was excellent and most importantly it made me feel like i'm home. the owner is very friendly and very understanding and helped us out for our return journey. enjoyed it to the fullest.",setu95,/Profile/setu95,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"We've stayed at Shaynam Hotel for nearly 10 years and enjoy the family-run guest house atmosphere, the colorful garden with umbrellas & deck chairs. The rooms are on the basic side and it can be a bit noisy along the street but the hotel is centrally located, and it's easy to get to the main bazaar in Leh. During high season there is hot water from the geezer mornings and evenings, and solar during the day. You do have to ask for a hot bucket sometimes during low season, or if the hotel isn't full. Just ask if you need anything, the staff is very helpful!",KamzangKim,/Profile/KamzangKim,"Kathmandu, Nepal",40
ladakh,"While the hotel has a nice courtyard/patio it's not the same property as the picture suggest. It's located on a very busy street what is very noisy!!! Earplugs are must! THERE IS NO HOT WATER, it's only available between 8-9am! Even then is spotty. Also, this place seems to allows locals to ""party"" there. I had to confront guest twice for being very loud past midnight. I wouldn't recommend this place. There are better and quiter places in town.
