They reduced cost of room when we had unplanned stay at thier guesthouse. Mr . Dorje helped me and my husband when i was down because of ams. They helped us to arrange our sightseeing.

ladakh,"Dorje/Donskit Guest House is located in upper Tukch, Leh ladhakh, J&K, 194101, at walking distance from Leh market. There is two part of G/H, Room-1 is newly constructed area while Room-2 is having kitchen and other facility. Rooms are neat and clean. Hot water, Wifi and Electricity is available regularly.          I with my family stay there for four days. The hospitality of Guest house owner Mr. Tsewang Dorje and his wife Tashi Angmo is hart touching. Due to their behavior we feel that this is our home away for home. They prepared breakfast and dinner as per our choice and serve us in their Ladakhi style kitchen. On my Sun-in-law’s demand one night they prepare special Ladakhi disc Skyu for us and we all like it very much. They are having a kitchen garden in which they grow",Ramesh B,/Profile/Enjoy_the_Touring,"Rawatbhata, India",50
ladakh,"I had booked 2 nights at Dorje guest house in June 2019 through agoda. On reaching, the caretaker lady told me that they hadn't received any communication from agoda & their internet was down since 2 weeks!  Imagine how does it feel to hear such a line, after a hectic road journey from Kargil! I showed my booking details, after which the lady allowed is in, with certain distrust on her face! Later she told me that agoda guys hadn't paid them for a year!  It was a deluxe room, however everything was dusty & bed linen was very dirty, with hair on it. The room attendant promptly changed the bed linen, however we were shocked to see sponge, instead of mattress!!! Although the view from the terrace is awesome & room is very spacious, but for any help, one needs to walk down 2 floors,",Sunita,/Profile/SunitaMandal,"Hyderabad, India",20
ladakh,One of my friend recommended me this place. He shared the number of Dorje also. Very nice place to be in. Dorje and his family is very helpful not only with the stay in the hotel but also with sightseeing.  It’s a must stay place,Shadab_sheikh,/Profile/Shadab_sheikh,"Mumbai, India",50
ladakh,"I was staying in this guest house for 5 days. The rooms are all incredibly homey, and some had awesome view of the mountains. In the rooftop area you can sit and enjoy your morning tea while looking at the mountain view.  It is a family run business, you can sort of see what a ladakhi family is like by interacting with the family members and observing their daily activities. The owner and his wife is very helpful in providing everything you need. From daily necessities to exploring the region, they can provide all those.   In my case, i was down with AMS for 2 nights and need medical attention. The owner is personally taking care of me, even bringing my breakfast to the hospital on his own! It does feel like i am treated as a part of the family.  They have hot water running,",nelson d,/Profile/577nelsond,,50
ladakh,"The best part of the stay in this guesthouse is the hospitality of Mr. Dorjee, his family  & his staff. Very polite & decent . Rooms are neat ,wash rooms clean . Has three categories of rooms.  The property has a couple of fruit bearing Apple trees along with a kitchen garden. The food served is hygenic & ok types. The guest house is a little walking distance from the main market ,approx. 15 min walk. I feel one should book a vehicle through Mr. Dorjee for sight seeing as other tour operators & their drivers tend to be unprofessional after they receive the payment in advance.

ladakh,I stayed here along with my best friend for a week while on our ladakh trip. The people here are too good. They were always very helpful. The breakfast they provide is amazingly good and they have their own farm garden too.

ladakh,"The place is a bit tricky to find, as Google maps did not provide the right route. However, it is known locally so with couple of queries you can find it out.  The place was a home extended to a guest house. Neat and clean rooms, nothing fancy though. He serves breakfast, lunch & dinner, however needs advance notice especially if you more than 2 people.  The host, Mr. Dorjee is quite approachable and does his best to help out. ",Shiv001,/Profile/Shiv001,"Toronto, Canada",40

ladakh,"Where to begin? First of all my stay at Dorje and his wife was my absolute highlight of my one month northern India trip.   He and his wife and two kids are basically the perfect way to start your trip trough the Tibetan culture. First of all the prices are really good, the rooms are clean, quiet, comfortable and neat.   Dorjè is a tour guide himself and has many years of experience with the entire Ladakh area.  Dorjè did everything to help us with planning tours / trips / journeys . Therefor always thought of the best for me, as a traveler. And not for him, nor his wallet. Virtually the (my) problem with almost the rest of India.   Dorgè's wife made us breakfast, tea, lunch, dinner, sweets and every time we walked in or out she stuffed something in our hands to eat or drink. ",Momozarroue,/Profile/Momozarroue,,50

I traveled around the time when no hotel or guest house in provides you water for shower & but if its Dorje guest house you get all these facilities, the owner Mr Dorje is such a humble & grounded person, well for me it was like home away from home...

ladakh,"This place is generally good, especially the rooms with the terrace. However, similar rooms are available in other guesthouses at lower rates.  Other than that, I faced major issue in this guest house when I showed up with a ClearTrip voucher. Dorje senior simply refused us a room, saying that some people has already booked the rooms with him, and he is not responsible for rooms booked by internet. ""how do I know you booked a room thru cleartrip? Did you call me to confirm?"" was his exact words. Long story short, I finally got the room only after escalating to ClearTrip customer service, and intervention from Dorje Junior (the son).  Other issues: 1. Most of the time only Dorje Senior and his wife are the only 'staff'. Thus, there is nobody else to help with your luggage. If you",Suman123,/Profile/Suman123,"Bengaluru, India",20

ladakh,We were four of us and we stayed in the Family room. Nice and spacious for a group of friends. The room had an attached bath as well (most of the other rooms on the floor had to use a common bath). The guest house was comfortable but what made our stay memorable was the friendly and sweet couple who ran the place. Helped us plan our entire time at Leh and were always willing to help. Stayed here for 5 days in September of 2010. Would definitely recommend it to budget travelers. Located at about 500m from the main bazaar road.,matz04,/Profile/matz04,"Noida, India",50

I believe it wouldn't happen if I didn't stay at Dorje Guesthouse for over six weeks.  It was remarkable to experience such an open-hearted authentic hospitality of a Ladaki family. Every little need or a question I had was answered or addressed as if it were their own. Whether I needed a motorbike to venture out, find a reputable trekking company, arrange a new simm card or a taylor to fit the clothes — all of that was given full attention with a sense of authentic cheerfulness.

The rooms that we stayed in were huge, airy, clean, well furnished, had Wifi :) and 24 hours hot water. The building is a traditional one with an organic garden and lots of Wood work everywhere. The best part about this place are the people. Dorje and Sanjay are always pleasant to talk too. This was proven by the fact when the owners actually came to see us off when we were leaving.

We really liked the room and especially  for the price they were giving it for. It was totally worth it. The room was spacious, clean and well furnished, the only downside being the washroom not attached with the room. But when we looked at the shared washrooms, there was nothing to worry as they were very clean and well maintained.  There is a nice garden outside and a place to sit as well.  The guest house is walking distance from the main market but the road can get a little creepy when it gets dark because there are no street lights. You might want to keep a torch with you.

Indeed, despite my booking done 3 months in advance AND paid, we arrived and were informed that there were no rooms available. The staff arranged a room in another guesthouse which was obviously very helpful but the said guesthouse was definitely a level below in terms of quality. My recommendation is then to call them few days before your arriving to check if your booking has been taken into account.

Our room was clean with nice view of the mountains etc but please avoid booking tours from them, they rips you off with the help of travel agents. Me and my girlfriend were forced to pay for the tour which we never went. It was annoying as they assumed our travel plans before enquiring us and never explained the full terms and conditions. We were threatened by their travel agents, cops etc. We had to pay to avoid trouble at midnight in a remote village in mountains esp when we have to catch an early morning flight for international connections.

The views from the terrace were incredible as well. All it seemed a decent place to stay. However on the first night of arrival we were told by the manager that the owner - Dorje sorted out all local travel arrangements - such as hikes, rafting etc. We sat down with Dorje who seemed to have an attitude of superiority from the first moment and did not seem to really take any interest or seemingly any notes about our plans.
