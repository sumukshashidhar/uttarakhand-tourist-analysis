ladakh,Hotel has good facilities and service but is keen on giving quality service to foreigners only.I guess they only want to cater to foreigners but not Indians. Staff does not have basic courteousy towards Indians.,Ruchi,/Profile/Traveller0412,,10
ladakh,This is a place where you feel peace and feel home. The staff is very very helpfull - the cook/the food is really very good and tasty - I stayed here one week and enjoyed every day. The hotel is situated in a big park/garden with many high and old trees with may nice flowers and bushes - there are many nice places all around the park/garden to sit and relax and enjoy. My next time in Leh/Ladakh I will return to Eco Poplar!,jan h,/Profile/503janh,"Kathmandu, Nepal",50
ladakh,"Location: Fort Road, 15-20 Min walk from Leh Main Market If you love nature, I'm pretty much confident that you will love this place. As the name goes, this property has lots of poplar trees. Poplar trees can grow to long heights. The property is set in a great location, it has lots of varieties of plants and flowers especially apricot trees. You can spend endless days admiring them. ( unfortunately during this time, there were no apricots). The manager told us that the owner of the property allows guests to pluck the apricots. The rooms are buit like cottages, with each cottage having 2 rooms. The rooms are not that spacious, but suffucient enough with central heating system. The cottages are built around the entire property. There are pathways that take you to your rooms.",Hriday A,/Profile/HridayA5,,40
ladakh,"Resort is spacious and has lot of Poplar, Apricot and Apple trees. Green place in midst of  Leh. Stayed here for 5 nights in June. Staff was friendly and helpful. One of the friends had mountain sickness in Leh and staff took good care of him. Food tasted nice. Situated at about 15 mins walkable distance from main Leh market and hence has access to restaurants. Overall felt that this was a very nice place to stay in Leh.",WildlifeEnthu,/Profile/WildlifeEnthu,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,"This resort gives you the real feeling of staying in Ladakh. Unlike most of the other hotels in town, this is set within a huge garden full of poplar trees and a lot of other greenery.

ladakh,"If you are looking for a natural, forest-like setting without the frills of a formal hotel stay, this is the place for you!  Located in a compound amidst groves of tall poplar trees and natural vegetation, the facility comprises approximately 20 individual guest houses of two units each, with a small shared veranda for each.  Ecology and sustainability are definitely the themes here, with beautiful flower gardens and extensive vegetable plots which provide much of the produce for the delicious meals served in the dining hall.  If the individual rooms might seem a bit Spartan, don't despair as you will be more than compensated by the peace and quiet all around.      The facility is under the capable management of Mr. Bidhi Cham, who will do everything possible to make your stay",TomR4012,/Profile/TomR4012,"Saint Louis, Missouri",40
ladakh,"Very nice gardens, trees and surrounding. Rooms neat and clean, linen and bathroom also very clean. Service polite and helpful, in line with all the people in leh and Ladakh. Only drawback for me was no room service and dinner finishes by 9.30 no food after that. Also all meals are buffets, take it or leave it. About 15 minutes walk to market access road close to hotel at night does not have light . All in all I will stay here again if I visit leh ",Rajni C,/Profile/Rajni63,,40
ladakh,"Poplar eco Resort took us from the very first moment. Nestled in a beautiful garden with lots of trees and flowers there are some cottages. Do not expect posh luxury, that is not the reason you should come to Leh. They offer basic, but clean accommodation with attached bathroom. It will be heated in the evening and hot ater is available in morning and evening. The food is very nice, north Indian and very tasty. The staff was wonderful and very friendly, we felt like in a second home.

The moment we entered it's gate, after seeing so much greenery and tranquility we had a sigh of relief. All our worries about acclimatization were out of the window. The small cottages surrounded by trees makes for a perfect visit. We stayed here for 2 days and then we went further and stayed here for another day on the last day of our trip. The whole ambiance is serene. Though the food needs some attention. The hotel staff is polite and courteous.",Himani R,/Profile/himanirana107,"New Delhi, India",40

We were a bit sceptical initially as to what will we do in the resort for that long... But the worry completely vanished the moment we entered this place. It was beautiful to say the least... The cottages were really cute and cosy and comfortable.. But what i would specifically like to mention is the hospitality of the staff and the food. The food was absolutely delicious and not once did it feel like we were having outside (read: greasy, spicy, unhealthy) food.. They took such good care of us that it actually felt like we were coming home...

ladakh,"Stayed at Eco Poplar for 2 nights recently during our visit to Leh. The place is very close to the market, just about a km. However, once you enter the resort, its very calm, quiet & serene. The gardens are very beautiful & you can enjoy the sun while sipping tea or coffee in the gardens. The gardens also have apricot & apple trees & in season, you can simply pluck the fruit & eat or pick up from the ripe ones fallen on the ground.  Only one thing to mention here is the hospitality. They will serve you best but within the framework of their 'rules'. The manager especially may wish to reflect on how to be more friendly & hospitable.  Overall, a great place to stay & highly recommended from our experience.",suyogsaraiya,/Profile/suyogsaraiya,,40

So many apricot trees around, we must have plucked thousands of them. staff was very courteous. We loved the garden sit out area. Having our Hi- Tea time there with garam snacks was a great experience. Rooms were so spacious & airy and clean. best was their in house vegetables farming. cauliflower, carrots, cabbages, beans etc vegetables they farm there and pluck them and cook. that aroma of fresh veggies was mindblowing.

ladakh,"Well what can one say about this gorgeous destination. From snow clad mountain peaks to the sand mountains- these are sights within themselves.  On entering Eco poplar resort it seemed like a small quaint home stay kind of place.  Amidst a tastefully and beautifully done up dining hall  and small reception area (with a tiny library), there is a tiny trail that leads you to small cottages on twin sharing basis. The cottages are cozy, clean and comfortable and come with an attached heater. However, there are no fans in the cottages resulting into suffocation when the temperature outside gets warmer during the day time. Also, the heaters require the generators for functioning and the same is not possible due to the load shedding and electricity connections prelevant in Leh.

ladakh,I stayed in Eco Poplar for 3 nights and I must say it has to be the best and the biggest property in town. It is a little gem amidst many commercial hotels in Leh. They have huge green area with great comfortable cottages. The best part about the resort is the services they provide and the extremely hospitable.

ladakh,"I discovered this little gem through a fellow traveler the last two weeks of my month-long stay in Leh -- a bit of a walk to restaurants/shopping (15 min), but the walk itself to the immediate area was always a welcome unwind from the commercial areas with their roadways full of honking vehicles and dust.  Clean, no-nonsense rooms, very polite and accommodating staff, though hot showers were not always readily available.  Little huts are positioned along a roughly rectangular perimeter, but the lush, almost wild greenery allowed to flourish all around them is what makes this place stand out from most other lodgings.

Breakfast was good, but we had to walk into town for lunch and dinner - about a 15 min walk. Staff were very helpful and polite. I tried to work out what was eco about this place but I have no idea.

We loved it! The peaceful garden setting, the lovely comfortable rooms and verandas and fantastic manager made this the perfect place to stay. We enjoyed the 5 - 10 minute walk up and back to town and the manager could organize transport for any sightseeing at very reasonable rates.

The rooms are small, non fussy, but comfortable and clean. Bathrooms were spotless. The staff is the high point - polite and super efficient. The food was all right - not great, a bit repetitive.

First of all, we only had hot water available for showers twice a day: 45 minutes in the morning at 7 AM and 45 minutes in the evening at 7 PM. Secondly, the rooms itself are very sparsely furnished and the bed / linen looks old and worn away. Our TV, (which was smaller than a computer monitor), was not working.
