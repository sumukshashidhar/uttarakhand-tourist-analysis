ladakh,"The Hotel people were very friendly and helpful, the meals were great and the only complaint was that some of our group could not get hot water in their morning showers. The location is perfect to visit the Leh fort and the old market area (both well worth a visit) - Wifi connection was a bit intermittent - but it seems that is normal up here",Joe H,/Profile/L3451XVjoeh,"Masterton, New Zealand",50
ladakh,The rooms were clean and so was the bathroom. Got good hot water. But overall service can get better. There is not many option of food provided though we want to place order. Staff are good too. We tried ordering for food and were asked to order or go out and eat. so basically service to be improved.,rads2k,/Profile/rads2k,"Chennai, India",30
ladakh,"This hotel is a good 10 minutes walk from the main hustle and bustle of the Leh high street and town centre.  It is set in quiet part of town and has views across the town and up towards the monastery and stupa.  There is parking available in the grounds of the compound and the exterior of the building is clean and reasonably well maintained.  The hotel owner/manager is charming and helpful. other staff are very happy to help but may not always be in a hurry.  Our room was on the first floor and looked out over an open area of land used for cultivation, with a nice view of the far mountains in the distance.  The room was very basic but nice and cool, however, the bed was very hard. The mattress appeared to be stuffed with jute making it exceptionally hard and rather itchy.

ladakh,"My capsule review :)  * Located close to the main road and market. * Would suggest this place for a traveler on a budget. * Parking inside premises. * Free WiFi but was very slow * Try to get rooms on the top floor, has much better views.

ladakh,The hotel is average. Initial greeting was not welcoming but later service was better. The hospitality is not so great. No choice of breakfast. Transport facilities will be arranged by request.Overall an average experience.,ashdev2016,/Profile/ashdev2016,"Bengaluru, India",30
ladakh,We stayed at Jorchung during our Leh drive in September 2014.   A good host. Good location. Not on the main road but just about walkable to the main road/main market. Quiet place. Go to the terrace for view of the Shanti Stupa and far away mountains.  We stayed 3 nights. Checked out and had come back again as Nubra valley roads were closed.   Nothing fancy. Decent food. Serves both vegetarian and non vegetarian.   Rooms are basic but spacious. Rooms on first floor are better. Unless the owner has added another floor. The higher up the better.  If you are there in season â€“ you can get fresh fruits too!,travellernayak,/Profile/travellernayak,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",40
ladakh,"I had a wonderful stay at Hotel Jorchung, Leh between 7th September 2015 and 14th September 2015. I had primarily gone to Leh to participate in the half marathon and this hotel was the ideal place for me to prepare for the same. Its about a 10 minute walk from the main market and hence has a calm atmosphere and is ideal for a quiet vacation. Its also located close to one of the best roads on the outskirts of Leh which helps train for the event. The room was extremely clean and spacious. I got one of the newly built rooms on the second floor, The room is equipped with a LED television. There are limited times set for running hot water, however, the staff is extremely helpful and do oblige when you request even beyond those hours. The owner of the hotel, Sonam is extremely helpful",Ajit L,/Profile/Ajit2210,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"Dates of stay : 24th of August 2015, 25th of August 2015, 27th of August 2015 & 29th of August 2015 - All in All 4 Nights with intervals  This was like home for us away from home. Nothing out of the world or a mind blowing hotel, but had all the basics right that a traveler might need.  We were on a Road Trip to Ladakh and had to request the hotel to guide us to the property once we reached Leh. Their person came in the Hotel Car and escorted us to the Hotel which was commendable.  Parking : Ample open parking for 15+ Cars within their premises   Rooms : Good spacious rooms with an amazing view of the snow capped peaks and the barren Ladakhi Mountains. Some rooms towards the far east of the Hotel had access to the Apple & Apricot Trees from which the fruits could be plucked and",ARAV-ESHITA,/Profile/ARAV-ESHITA,"Kolkata, India",40
ladakh,"I have stayed there for 4 nights as i had got this hotel stating a 3 star property from Yatra.com, I would rate it as a Lodge than an hotel. Basic rooms, warm water in bathrooms is provided only from 4:30 AM to 8 AM.  No heaters in rooms. No stool in bathrooms. The cutlery were not washed properly, had food stains on it, had pointed it out 5-7 times to the staff. For which I have received response as "" Sir, aapko hi kyu aise plates or spoon milte hai"". Food is like what you will get in a bad hostel mess. Same kitchen for Veg and Non-veg, be aware Vegetarians. Please don't expect anything from food.  People drinks in open area of the hotel, so think twice before taking your family along.  Wifi never worked during my stay. Best part was that the view i got from my room window,",bhawsar,/Profile/bhawsar,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",20
