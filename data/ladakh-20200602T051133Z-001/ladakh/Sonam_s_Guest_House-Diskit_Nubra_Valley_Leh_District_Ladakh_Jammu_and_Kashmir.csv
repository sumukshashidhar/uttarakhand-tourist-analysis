ladakh,"This guest house has amazing hosts with amazing food to offer in Diskit, Hunder. Food is the best part as it is a place where the owners serve food giving a homely feeling and that too with the fresh vegetables and fruits grown in their own farm.

ladakh,"Unfortunately , This was our worst stay , experience in our entire Leh Trip.  We stayed there for 2 nights,  The room which was allocated us was good,  there were few light points were came out but overall it was nice room , good bed, and big wash room , good view from balcony.  Location wise Guest house in on the road , stone throw away from Diskit monastery  Our 2 days exp, was quite bad for Food and service ,   They do not have cook so all managed by one room boy and the owner lady sonam JI   Due to the good locations , all bikers do prefer this guest house.  It get full by 8:30 to 9:00 PM for night stay for all bikers and causal travelers.

ladakh,"Having decided to stay overnight in Nubra to enjoy the white sand dunes was actually turning out to be a nightmare with being welcomed by a whole lot of insects who were actually there crawling on our beds in a hotel we booked in Hunder. So we decided to just call it quits and were heading back to Leh. It's then our guide suggested we giving a shot here in Diskit and not spoil our moods. I'm glad we listened  to him that's how we came across Sonam Guest House. A really good homestay with a really amazing family hosting you. The rooms were good, spacious. The food was home cooked and with the owners actually feeding you while telling stories, making sure u feel at home.

ladakh,We stayed for 1 night at Sonam's guest house also known as Padma Guest House in Sep'17.      We drove from Pangong and Hanle was planned as a stopover before strarting for Tso Mo RiRi the following day.      Must say our stopover at Hanle was worthy. The drive from Pangong to Hanle is an experience in its own. During our entire drive we came across just 1 vehicle and hence needless to say it is deserted but beautiful. The colour of the Himalayan ranges turns purple at various spots and it's a feast for the eyes.      Hanle permits only Indian citizens so one has to ensure all permits are in place.      We reached Sonam's Padma Guest House by 2.30 by which time lunch hour had passed. The owner's wife though was very couteous and offered us tea and bread before we started for the,Hetal G B,/Profile/HetalGB,"Mumbai, India",40

ladakh,views like paintings with purple sand gives one moment of proud to compete with foreign locations. I'd been to many foreign locations and believe me there is no such places we have here in ladakh regio. And hanley is one of them.,Siddharthg86,/Profile/Siddharthg86,"New Delhi, India",40

ladakh,"Happened to stay here on 28th May 2016.  We came via Srinagar and drove from Leh on the morning of 28th. First 60odd km are fantastic. Post that you slow down a lot due to ongoing road work. It improves after 30km. Route is isolated but very scenic. Do carry permit for Hanle. Also, no airtel after you leave Upshi.  Had called up Sonam the night before (Sonam is the name of the owner but the place is officially known as padma guest house) and he had reserved a 3-bed room for a fantastic price.  We arrived by about 6:30 and the place was easy to find due to marking. Nothing much to do in Hanle apart from the observatory and ofcourse the unbelievable night sky. Its unreal.  We were carrying our food / snacks / eatables and Sonam was very co-operative in providing us hot water for",BunnyPunia,/Profile/BunnyPunia,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"Just back from the trip of my dreams. Covered Hanle and the observatory. Hanle is such a magical place - far far away from the crowded tourist spots!!!  I had the opportunity to stay overnight at Padma Guest house at Hanle and it was a delightful experience! Mr. Sonam Dorjee was extremely warm and friendly and wonderful homely food made the experience all the more special.   Quick update - BSNL postpaid numbers will WORK at Hanle (Kaldo Village to be precise). If you have the spare time, Hanle is a must visit on your list. Just make sure you have permits to visit this place.",PixelFusion,/Profile/PixelFusion,"Bengaluru, India",50
ladakh,"We reached Hanle at around 3:30 pm and were to surprised to find the only Guesthouse locked. After shaking the gates and shouting Bhayya, Bhayya - the caretaker emerged from the opposite house.  The owner was away due to some personal emergency. Mr. Paljor, a relative of the owner was our host. He always sported a smile on his face and cooked whatever we asked for.  Since, we took the Chushul route from Pangong, there were no restaurants on the way. By the time we reached the homestay, all of us were hungry.  The quilts provided were very comforting (experienced snow fall 2 times at Hanle). The food was good. The rooms were clean.  Only point to improve - The common toilet can be converted from Indian style to Western style  Awesome hospitality at such a remote place",TheWallStands,/Profile/TheWallStands,"Ithaca, New York",50
ladakh,"Hanle is an off beat place which is not a typical tourist location. The place is famous for its landscape. While driving from Pangong to Tso Moriri, you can take a detour of 72Km from Loma Bend ITBP Check Post to visit Hanle and stay overnight here. This is the only place where you will require an Inner Line Permit to be issued at Leh. The place is famous for 2Meter long diameter Chandra Telescope of Indian Institute of Astrophysics. Chinese border is nearby and lot of trade happens here with Chinese traders near the border. The scientists from Bangalore and Hoskote access remotely the world's highest observatory located at 15000ft above sea level at Hanle. Previously, the observatory used to provide its guest house to tourists but now they have stopped doing that. Hence you",GolakaNath,/Profile/GolakaNath,"Mumbai, India",40
