ladakh,We really enjoyed our stay in Pong guesthouse. The hospitality and personal touch provided by Mr Pong was great. The wood work in newly constructed rooms is great. The bathrooms have high quality Jaquar and Cera fitted . Everything is well taken care of by the staff. Mr Pong was very nice and was always ready to help with a smile.,Aakanksha G,/Profile/540aakankshag,"Pune, Maharashtra, India",50
ladakh,"This is a nice, new guest house in a peaceful location away from town (although there is a dog next door that can be noisy.) It's about a 20 minute walk to town. The owner, Thupsten, is really hospitable and happy to arrange everything.",Peregrineri,/Profile/Peregrineri,"New Delhi, India",50
ladakh,"Never in my life before I have seen a Hotel owner, who will take the personalized service to a level that is unthinkable in this world now a days. Receiving you at your arrival place, arranging everything you need, taking you personally to places and for shopping, cooking your food, arranging your vehicle at a cheaper rate.. he did everything personally.Always smiling, always accomodaing! His hotel has only 4 rooms- they are spacious, clean and with large windows viewing the snow capped mountains through the lush green trees! The bathroom is bigger that many hotel rooms I have been to. Loved every moment of out stay!",dholai,/Profile/dholai,"Atlanta, Georgia",50
