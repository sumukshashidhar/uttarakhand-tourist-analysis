The treatment you receive in this hotel by the owner is absolutely splendid. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is tired of the indifference and insensitivity of the hotel staff elsewhere in the country and is visiting Leh for the first time. People are very co-operative. Rooms are clean. However, the staff members are new and a little unprofessional. Food is not up to the mark. But as I said, all of it gets overshadowed by the hospitality and care you receive there. At the end you would definitely remember the stay with numerous beautiful memories.",freghmaplux,/Profile/freghmaplux,,40

ladakh,"They need a crash course on every aspect of hospitality. This place is not for Senior Citizens or experienced travellers atall.May be the attitude for Senior Citizens is ""they are not going to come back"". It's an obligation if they are alloting you a room and giving you meals on time. We were forced to move away from the room,which we were occupying,to make way for someone else,who had threatened and shouted to get the same room.Seniority also didn't count. They probably mean well and try hard to please, mostly after things have gone wrong.If they become organised and train their staff,it will be well for them.

The rooms, people, the owner, the workers, everyone's behaviour is just so like our family members and their love. Me and my family and Every body with us who went there and stayed felt like home. Definitely the owner and his mistress played the role of our parents. Not only professionally they helped and entertained us, but also they made us feel their own children and how the Layul palace turned to our own home so fast that we can not explain.

The hotel's proprietor Mr. Malik and his sons Mr. Javed and Mr. Salim ensure that all their guests are personally taken care of. Even when we landed in Leh on our own without any set plan, it was they who guided us, planned a very good trip for us, arranged vehicles for us, got permits for us, etc. We owe it to them for making our trip a very comfortable and a memorable one.

As soon as we reached Layul, not only did we receive a warm welcome but we were also made aware of do's and don'ts on the 1st day and thereafter. The stay at Layul would make you feel like home away from home. We were treated like their family by all the members. Not only that, the entire trip was arranged for the 7 days we were in Leh including the transport.   The family used to get up at 5:00am in the morning to serve us breakfast and they even made a point to treat us with a scrumptious meal on the Eid day. Some specialities include the Gud gud chai, thupka & Ladakhi bread. We were fascinated with the treatment and I am sure anyone would be.

ladakh,"My first trip to Leh. Had to check where I stay before I book. Where else - TRIP ADVISOR!!!!!  So I booked La-yul Palace. As mentioned in most reviews, it is a family away from family. From Senior Malik to Mrs Malik to Javed (son), Evereyone is on their toes to please you when you request something. This currently has 6 rooms but will have 12 starting 25th July 2015 (1 is a suite). Rates -very low..  Family - No1 ever allows a guest to enter the kitchen. I am sure we all know - Kitchen is a aholy place. I happened to cook breakfast for myself and another guest (eggs, thats easy, but i did).   They actually help organise your whole stay in Laddhak if you tell them in advance.

I would recommend this place specially to lone travelers visiting this place for first time. Owners of the place (Maliks) are extremely helpful and would help you plan your trip in a nice way. We had overwhelming experience with them when we were stuck by AMS. Food is homely and tasty.

ladakh,"All the family and staff are extremely kind, friendly and helpful which makes this an outstanding choice. Rooms are comfortable and the home cooked food is recommended.  I chose not to rate the full five stars because: * Location: As a solo traveller I eventually preferred a place closer to the ""happening""; * There was heavy construction going on the whole day of my arrival due to expansion of the guesthouse, while I hoped for a quiet restday that very day to get accustomed to the altitude first. People were too nice to complain to, but normally I would have appreciated an apology at least. Anyway they should have finished construction by now and turned it in a relaxed and quiet place to stay.",Pieter O,/Profile/PJO71,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",40

After going through bunch of stuff on Net, finally we made our mind to stay at Layul Palace and luckily got the contact information of owner Mr. Javed Mallic. We informed our tentative plan to him over phone.  We stayed there for 7 days, however from the day one we did not feel it like a hotel rather we were comfortable like home.  Mr. Mallic and his team were very friendly and made our stay homely. The hotel service was excellent and the ambiance was pleasant.  Mr. Mallic also guided us and arranged all our transportations.

The room itself is very clean, with warm running water, TV with Tata Sky and also we were provided with extra quilts as the weather was still chilly as we reached.

I entrusted a trip for for my in-laws (June '12) and some of their friends to Javed - a huge risk in itself!!  He and his family did not fail me.  The hotel is clean and value for money and will definitely recommend a stay with them. Services mentioned and pictures as provided are true.  Leh and it's buddhist monasteries are an experience. The Stok la trek as well as a stay in the Nubra Valley are a must. Pangong lake is picturesque. A day's rest for acclimatization at the beginning will pay rich dividends - a must if you've flown in.,dhruba_m,/Profile/dhruba_m,"Rourkela, India",50
