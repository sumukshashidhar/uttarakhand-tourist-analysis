ladakh,"I've stayed at Botho Guesthouse twice for a total of 4 week.  Personally I love the remoteness from Leh; there is no hussle and bustle here; simply beauty, hospitality, great food and wonderful service.  The guesthouse has a taxi for hire so it's easy to get out and about. We visited many monasteries and beautiful natural sights during our time in Shey.  The guesthouse is family run in the truest sense. We were never sure who had cooked the delicious vegetarian meal we were eating. Father, Mother and daughter are all excellent cooks.  They made sure that I got medical care early in the first visit when I suffered from High Altitude Sickness. I look forward to my next visit!!",Karen L,/Profile/karenl321,Annapolis MD,50
ladakh,"Leh is ok and worth visiting for a couple of days for sure but if you are not drawn to quite heavily touristic towns I’d highly recommend Botho GH in Shey as a place to base yourself and to stay.   Across 3 weeks in Ladakh and Zanskar my hotel and guest house lodgings have mainly been in the 800 to 1000 rupees per night category. Botho GH includes breakfast and dinner for 800 rupees. It’s website provides details. For me, it has been the lowest cost but highest quality place that I have stayed in.   I got soft towels, a very comfortable double bed with a warm duvet and clean covers, hot and strong solar powered showers and it is clean.  The guest house offered excellent food - for breakfast and dinner. In my time there, meals were different each time: Breakfast: porridge",Jon D,/Profile/B185RUjond,Chester,50

ladakh,"It happens so rarely that you meet people and they take you in as a family. My two months stay at Botho guest house not only gave me a place to lodge at but it also gave me such an amazing family. I was pleasantly surprised by the food and eventually have grown so fond of it that I don’t like my own cooked food.  Eventually, over time I became a part of them. Every evening I sat and had long chats over dinner understanding more of the culture which they always explained with such patience.   All I can say is that Botho guest house is now my family, my home who I miss dearly but I am sure that when I get back to leh next year, I will stay with them.   If you are looking for the best combination of food, love, comfort and a family then Botho guest house is the place for you, my",ANANT BRAR,/Profile/Julleyindia,,50
ladakh,"A real ""home away from home""! I am usually not so effusive with praise, but how else would you feel if you end up being invited by the host to a family gathering and feasting, within a few hours  of aquaintance :) The hosts have two properties. One is the guesthouse on the Leh-Manali road, and a homestay a 5 minuta walk from the nain road. I was put up at the honestay, as the guesthouse was under renovation. The honestay is effortlessly beautiful. You get to have breakfast and dinner with the hosts in theur kitchen. Dinner was something I started looking forward to. Every night they would cook up a Ladakhi speciality for me. Rooms are spartan. There is no wifi (which makes sure you get  time for long walks, cosy conversations, reading a book).

ladakh,"Botho Guesthouse is a brilliant base to any travelers adventures in Ladakh. Thinles and his family are some of the nicest most hospitable people I have met on my travels, providing not only clean and comfortable living spaces, but also the family atmosphere that makes your stay feel more than just a guest.  I had a very relaxing time, with a great location to visit the many monasteries in the region and also a perfect spring board from which to explore the beautiful landscapes surrounding the area. I would highly recommend to all travelers to stay at Botho for an amazing experience that you will not regret.",dhegartyemail,/Profile/dhegartyemail,"County Dublin, Ireland",50
ladakh,"If you're looking for a cultural experience, allowing yourself to let go and become like a member in a Ladhaki family, you will enjoy your stay here.  You will experience the genuine goodness of Ladhaki people, without ever feeling any lack of professional courtesy. Family meals are one of the better parts, when the travelers passing through mingle with the others who have stayed a longer while here. There are guests who've stayed for months, working on projects or as volunteers in the Druk Padma Karpo school. People of almost all nationalities, and the family is always there, serving from the kitchen adjoining and filling in with their parts to the stories.  Whether you're a believer of Buddhism or not, the serene and majestic mountains will calm you when you're out walking.",rajivgera,/Profile/rajivgera,"Faridabad, India",50
ladakh,"I rarely write reviews on TripAdvisor, unless the place is so extraordinary that I feel guilty about remaining silent.  So when I came on here today to write a review that would do the guesthouse and the family that runs Botho Guesthouse justice, I was not surprised to see that 35 other people had already done the work for me!   The family that runs the guesthouse -- more like a homestay in terms of hospitality -- treat you like a member of their family. They went above and beyond any of my expectations (whether kindness, thoughtfulness, culinary abilities, local/spiritual knowledge, etc.), and this hospitality value cannot be measured!  Rooms were large and clean, the water was always hot, and the food was amazing.  They even offered a meditation/prayer room that was magical in",Keenan_Explorer,/Profile/Keenan_Explorer,,50

ladakh,"We stayed here for 5 nights, Rigzin and her family really made us feel welcome. It is a great place to relax and take in the surrounding scenary. The food that was provided was genuinely the best we had in India. They arranged all the activities that we wanted to do in Ladakh, even gave a discount of 10%. We were really down leaving this guesthouse as we wer made feel like one of the family and thats how it felt when we left. ",Brian T,/Profile/SocketTwomey,"London, United Kingdom",50
ladakh,We stayed in Botho Guesthouse for 5 nights and cant recommend it enough. Best value for money since we have been traveling. Food was amazing and the hospitality they showed was fantastic. We were actually almost upset leaving. There are lovely walks all around and just a short drive into Leh where you need to go to Brazil cafe for a coffee. We arranged a day trip around Leh with them and had a great time touring around. Rooms are big and the surroundings are very beautiful. Really enjoyed our stay here.”,Deirdre N,/Profile/936deirdren,,50
ladakh,"I stayed at Botho Guesthouse in August, 2017. From the day I arrived in Shey to the day I left, I was treated like a family-member by Rigzin and her family. They went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable, ensuring that I acclimatize well, get the best of the local cuisine while taking care of my vegetarian eating habits, telling me interesting Ladakhi stories, and arranging for travel. The rooms were very neat and clean, and spacious. The location of the guesthouse is pretty amazing, since it's not right in the middle of Leh, it helps you stay out of the usual crowded mess, while being very well connected to Leh via local transportation. The guesthouse is right opposite the '3 Idiots' school - Druk Padma Karpo, and very close to tourist places such as Thiksey",Divya T,/Profile/divyat123,"Lohardaga District, India",50

The food was delicious and a real flavour of Ladakh, the rooms were spacious and comfortable, the gardens were gorgeous with Kashmiri Apples and Apricots available on demand, and the family were most welcoming. I cannot recommend this place enough if you're looking for a peaceful stay away from the madness of Leh but yet only a quick spin out the road.

Thinles helped schedule our travels, which turned out great, and went out of his way to ensure we enjoyed the best of Ladakhi hospitality.

One has to just reach Botho guest house and then on it is Mr Thinles responsibility to take excellent care of you - with respect to permit, stay, food, planning site seeing, cab arrangement and anything else.

I really miss her cooking now.  All rooms have attached toilet with water heater. The room I stayed in even have a attached family area. Everyday breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner were served to the dinning room/hall connected to our room.

Roaming around in tripadvisor, seeing everyone's post, I saw a recommendation for Botho Guesthouse and mainly a recommendation for Thinles. Everyone who visited this guesthouse spoke so highly of Thinles that I was sure this is the place we'll be staying in.   Word of advice, instead of emailing him try calling him directly! The internet is absolutely horrendous in Ladakh and almost non existent.   So that's what I did! Called him, told him when we'll stay and asked him if he can arrange a taxi and told him our plans.

The rooms are clean, simple and reasonably spacious.  In the coldest weather I would bring a sleeping bag, even though there were numerous blankets on offer (but that is my personal preference and should not detract from the high recommendation I give for this guest house).

Everybody must go through this dilemma once in a while with a handful of places.  I stayed at the old Botho home - if you stay here, this becomes a homestay and is no longer `the' guest house. You get all the pamperings from Thinles, Sonam, Jigmet, grandad and the rest of the family. Mind you, it is a very simple place, but if you are a traveler (and not a tourist) and hanker for simplicity, combined with warmth and affordability, and tasty, robust home food with a local twist- you get all of these  in spadefuls.

Be sure to ask him about his years of experience working with NGOs and trekking the mountains. He personally cooks breakfast and dinner for everyone, and the communal meals were a highlight for me.
