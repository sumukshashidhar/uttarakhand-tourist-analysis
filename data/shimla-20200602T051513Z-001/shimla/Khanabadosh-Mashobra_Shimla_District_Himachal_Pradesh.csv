shimla,"Khanabadosh is an excellent homestay...nestled in Mashobra away from hustle bustle of Shimla. The amenities are outstanding....our room had all the luxuries which one can dream of and an amazing view of Dhauladhars. What matters is the man behind the machine and not the machine....akin to that is Geetika...the perfect hostess...and her team..ever smiling and willing you to pamper and ensure you are looked after very well. The food was an astronomical delight....spread was fantabulous....and  best part she and her staff ensured during our 5 day stay that our taste buds were always tingling. The three doggos,,,sultan, bruce lee and gabbar....are so playful...you can spend the whole day with them. Adjacent places are a trekkers delight...

shimla,A good place ..approach road needs to be tarred. Place is about 2 to 3 years old. Owner ; Geetika stays on property and doubles up as chef in charge. Food and service is extremely good. Her dogs are fun loving and disciplined. Please take tips from her for nature trails and places to visit in Mashobra. Bar is well stocked. Rooms are tidy and tastefully decorated. Tall can bump into the ceiling. TV has all major shows. Network connectivity is good. Water supply is disruptive. Overall it doesn't affect your peace.

Khanabadosh is a quaint, little place. It calls itself a BNB, but its owner, Geetika, a hostess of a different mould and a consummate cook, is ever eager to go to great lengths to prepare meals of guests' choice for lunch and dinner. In her endeavours to make her guests feel totally at home, she's ably assisted by her two staff members and her three simply adorable Golden Retrievers.

We were with them for four days, and we came away feeling like we’d been friends for longer because Khanabadosh is so much more than just a BnB getaway. It is a feeling, so difficult to pin down but one you HAVE to experience to understand it. The house is beautiful to look at & carefully filled with curios that will have you stop to admire them every second step. The rooms are clean, warm, comfortable (best sleep we’ve had in a while).

Raw himachal surrounds the property, but you have all the amenities that one can think of, if not more. Lavish furnishings, great interiors, art in every corner you look, in short, all things what a luxury hotel will have. Then whats different about it? The warmth, the perfection, the taste, the thinking that has gone into Khanabadosh. Whether it's the quirky signboards, or wrapped books -""blind date with a book"" , or the sitting area, its all too good, beyond a normal person's wildest imagination.

shimla,"Khanabadosh was referred to me by a trusted friend and after a long day of cycling from Chandigarh to Simla, we were looking forward to this visit the next day. And as we reached this quiet and surreal place, looking down into a valley, we did not expect that the experience would be so enriching and become etched deep in our memories.  Khanabadosh, was a truly mind-expanding experience, a journey within. When I saw antique cameras from 18th or early 19th centuries on display, I knew we were in for a treat. We could spend a couple of days simply absorbing the thoughtfully organized library, furniture, frames, pictures, plants etc. The hospitality was great, and at times it seemed too good to be true.   And outdoors surrounding the place, offered a plethora of options. Take a walk",aaloksharma71,/Profile/aaloksharma71,"Chandigarh, India",50
shimla,"I wasn’t too sure about the place when a friend suggested we go for lunch to Khanabadosh. Lunch only, because the rooms were all taken. And only when we got there, I knew why there was no vacancy.  The owner Geetika, has impeccable taste in creating a home. Each corner of the home looks like it’s out of a magazine. Well thought out, warm and inviting - that’s what the entire home is. While each room is unique and beautifully done, and you could perhaps just laze inside, the deck in the front garden is also alluring. Here you can do yoga or just enjoy the sounds of nature, with a large statue of a meditating Buddha for company. Or you can lounge in the cosy library, surround yourself with books - you won’t even need to head out for tea.   But that is not the only draw of the",Ruchi N,/Profile/RuchiN34,,50

shimla,"I'd visited Khanabadosh, when it had just been established. I regret, why I didn't review it right then. In spite of which, each moment spent there is as if indelibly etched on my mind. It's only now, when I happened to read other reviews including the one by drsrinee2016 (from chandigarh) that I felt that I shouldn't delay any further.  I travel often...mostly, on business. This time, it was for me. An overbearing need to be far from the proverbial madding crowd had me looking for a cosy nook...in the mountains. It also had to be a home stay, as a part of me sought human indulgence with a local piquancy. Khanabadosh fit the bill.  I honestly hope my review does justice to the magic that followed.

shimla,Stayed here for 2 nights for a boyz night out - 4 of us and loved every min of it. Pen Singh was so great and took excellent care of us! The house and rooms are exquisite ! The place was almost full once we arrived but you wouldn't have known it - it was so quiet. The rooms are luxurious - beds wonderful - bathrooms huge. The place is generous beyond belief - we had a gallon of tea/coffee and werent charged for it! You CANNOT miss their local preperations . We will drive 4 hours again from Chandigarh just for the opportunity to stay here and just EAT. We are all lamb and  and dessert boys and this place was heaven on both accounts! Please stop here if you have the opportunity and say Hi to Geetika - she is an exceptional host! Ok ,Rikku85,/Profile/Rikku85,"Dalhousie, India",50

shimla,"Experience was mixed. The property is great, the snow added to the beauty, but it is definitely over priced. Pricing  has to be  more transparent.  Also there were moments when we felt like tenants who are being questioned by the house owner. This happened when the loo malfunctioned. The repeated questioning regarding the malfunction because we had children was quite annoying.You definitely don’t want such an experience on a holiday.   Pricing is like a hotel, but hospitality was colored by house owner’s perceptions.In response to a personal feedback, the lady who runs the place has assured working on the same.

It had snowed a few days before I went there so the meadows and forests were covered with pristine white snow.  There are three or four rooms to choose from. Each one is decorated differently and they are all beautiful ...My favorite is the room in the Attic, it has the most beautiful antique bed and a skylight that will allow to skygaze from the comfort of your room, on a chilly winter evening.

From being treated horribly at another place in Chail, to being treated like VVIPs, we were plesantly overwhelmed. Khanabadosh was just what we needed to bring in 2018. Situated in a quaint village in Mashobra, this amazing villa is hosted by an even better host. We were put up in the most amazing room in the villa, the attic. Being a sucker for wooden architecture and attics, this just felt heavenly and we did not want to leave at all. Trust me, photographs just dont do justice at all.
