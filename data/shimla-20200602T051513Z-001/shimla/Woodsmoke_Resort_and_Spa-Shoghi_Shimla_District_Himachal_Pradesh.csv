On our first day we had some issues with the food but the staff was cooperative enough to tackle it for the rest two days. Rooms were spacious and beautiful though we had some smell problem in one of the room which was also tackled with a smile. Their library is beautiful, their coffee shop has a balcony which is an idle place to enjoy your coffee with a great valley view. I would recommend you to take a room near the library or the coffee shop.",Himank Gupta,/Profile/himankgupta90,"Mumbai, India",40
shimla,"Most of you would agree that as a costumer, it's always the one negative experience that stays with you and becomes the highlight of the entire stay. So let me begin there before I move on to the positives. The first word of advice if you plan to book this place is to do your research on the rates being offered by the resort and what the travel sites are selling this place for. We are frequent travelers and this one was a last minute plan. I stumbled upon this place while intending to book Aamod shogi. Looked at the Trip Advisor reviews and found it decent enough so decided to try it out. We directly contacted the resort as our experience thus far said that the best rates come directly from the hotel and cuts out all the other caveats too. So this time we did not even check what",Isha Gera,/Profile/ishagerag,"New Delhi, India",30

We were welcomed by Mr. Girish during late check-in, and next morning by Mr. Raghuvendra who made sure that our stay is pleasant.    Property was clean, far from Shimla's busy streets, and amidst peaceful lush green area. We traveled by our car, and it hardly took 30-35 minutes to reach to Shimla's Lift parking facility.

Choose your rooms wisely, every room has views but few has balcony (which is better for view). Very nice, courteous staff; welcoming and quick to respond.  Resort is completely vertical, doesn't offer any lawn so difficult for elderly people. Also I found it bit unsafe for kids below 5 as all the stairs are not covered with proper railings.   They've an amazing yoga instructor and first class is also complementary. Yoga was an amazing experience in mountains.   Do not expect a lavish buffet breakfast. Breakfast is just about ok.

Rather than stopping us to take food for them to our rooms, you should offer the same to us on your own while understanding their requirement.

shimla,Stayed in a suite at this hotel in last week of May. Booked a suite room expecting wonders in terms of quality and service. My honest view highlighted below - Pros - the location of the resort is perfect if you are looking for a secluded place and looking forward to a peaceful time. The look and feel of the resort is good. You can take a nice walk amidst the hills with no traffic or noise.  Cons- all rooms are more or less same so no point paying extra for a premium or suite room. You can actually book a regular room and bargain for an upgrade.  The food is bad (controlling myself to write pathetic). During our stay we noticed that guests (including us) just had the average free breakfast and everyone went outside for lunch and dinner.

shimla,"Both myself and my wife stayed at Woodsmoke & Spa resort for 3 nights. I have to say that this was the highlight to our honeymoon trip to Manali & Shimla. We boarded the Himachal Tourism bus from Manali on the 10th of May @ 8:30 am and headed towards Shimla. I remember sending an e-mail to the hotel management about a month before our travel informing them that we were going to Shimla for our honeymoon. Now, I really need to highlight this, we are Malaysians and we do not speak Hindi language at all. Neither did we have a local number where the hotel could've contacted us. What surprised me was that during our journey to Shimla via bus, the bus conductor came around looking for Passengers of seat number 9 & 10. That was our seat number. All he said while looking at us was",Sathiya R,/Profile/Sathiya85,"Puchong, Selangor, Malaysia",40

It was a wonderful Experience, the Staff's are very good, Food is fresh hot and tasty, especially Mushroom, Roti is like home cooked..  This property is very good if you want some peace from City Hustle Bustle, even Shimla city is very crowded..  At night the environment is totally different better than the day.

Comes close to full filling the reason people want to visit a hill station.   Plus points:  1. Location is nice and very peaceful. good for groups and people looking for quiet ME time also. Good View of Valley. 2. Friendly Staff, including with kids, they did play around with our kids.  3. Food quality is ok but they can certainly increase the spread, but atlas they accept it can make things on request for kids. So plus point for Chef. 4. Rooms are ok.  5. Activity room includes TT and Pool Table.  Negatives: 1. Food Spread is less, Should definitely be increased but the Chef is a nice guy and can make anything for you. 2. Not many activities so can get boring",Ranvijayronny,/Profile/Ranvijayronny,"Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India",40
shimla,"Frankly speaking we had not imagined that we would be so impressed by this resort. This place is 13.5 km before shimla. We were two couples and 3 kids and had a very comfortable stay of 3 nights and four days. Regarding the rooms, All the rooms are good with good views however the best are super deluxe rooms, room no 201, 202 and 203. The property is small. The staff is very courteous. We would specially like to thank the chef shyaam ji, staff member premji and the manager vivekji who made sure that we had a comfortable stay.  Regarding the food, quality of food was good however since we checked in in week day occupancy was less so buffet was not prepared.

shimla,We stayed here for 4 Days and on reaching the resort I was bit unhappy since the hotel was bit far from the city (15KM) but as we started living there our concept to leave a bit far from the city was very wise decision because place is calm and quiet whereas city is full of noise and traffic jam.The rooms are really luxurious and the best part of it is that staff are courteous and helpful. As we we are vegetarian they prepared our food separately and the food was outstanding.The GM MR RAJESH has a great knowledge about himachal and we had a great time talking with him in the evening.

We took one of their super deluxe rooms with a view of the valley. The view was OK however it would have been better from a different room. The mini bar was empty there was no liquor or soft drinks to be found. For smokers I'd recommend get your cigarettes with yourself as you won't find any around, the hotel staff is helpful and will certainly procure them for you but coz of the location it may take them ages. The food is total disappointment please do not order fish and chips at all. It's better to go out and eat. Apart from food everything else was good the hotel staff was helpful.

Interior was good, food was fine, hotel didn't had internal heating, a blowing heater was there, but we didn't found it chilly inside. The only cons of this place is conveyance, and i would suggest the hotel to keep a shuttle service(free ofcourse) till the city area, this will add to t.e customer experience.  The place had a nice restaurant, and they were happy to make a little variation to the available food in the breakfast. Dinner in the hotel was also nice.

Me being a foodie and a critic for same, I would give 8 out of 10 for their quality and taste of food. Spacious rooms.
