The quality of food is very good & tasty. It feels like they cook organic food with no extra oil and masalas. Serve the food the authentic way.

shimla,As this was a family trip i wanted this to be the best. Looking back i feel we mase the right decision by coming here. The place is little inside from the National Highway & I guess that's what  appealed us. The surroundings were beautifull we even went tracking to a nearby hill & were served hitea there. The experience was too good. Night experience sitting on the rooftop listening to soothing music was another amazing experience. There are enough games for the kids.Village visit is another great experience not to be missed if you love a rustic experience.Food is just the right kimd to suit one's taste & not heavy on stomach.For ladies there is a facility of message which was relaxing.Overall good stay experience in the hills.,NitinLokhande,/Profile/NitinLokhande,,50

shimla,It was a wonderful stay at this resort with excellent hospitality and good food. The owners Mr. and Mrs. Shashi were very friendly and helpful. They personally looked into the guest needs. This is a small property with only 10 room at an excellent location with all the ammonites  . The service is top notch . They even send their staff members when me and my child were playing cricket to do the fieling for us. We get fresh milk and ghee to eat. We also saw the owners house . They sent a staff member with us for tracking and he also Carrie's pakoras and tea and we had a small picnic at the hill top  . The resort has alot of games for your kids also. All over a fantastic place to visit and stay for at least 2-3  days with nature. This place is awesome for a brake from the city life,Jay A,/Profile/agarwalsmintu742016,"New Delhi, India",50
shimla,"I went there with family and friends in the month of March. The resort is just a short detour from National Highway near Shoghi. The place is top rated because: 1. Calm, silent, peaceful surrounding with no commercial activities you see in and around Shimla these days. 2. It's a good place for nature lovers and photographers with a wide range of treks and views available. 3. They organise moonlight treks and as I was travelling at full moon time, was lucky to enjoy it.  4. The staff is very polite and accommodating. My 2 small kids enjoyed the attention they got. Be it food, service, games... Anything.  5. The food is simple yet tasty. They have got the cleanest kitchen I have seen in hotels.  6. The hosts, Mr. and Mrs. Dogra are great hosts and took personalised care of us.  7.",Ritika B,/Profile/804ritikab,,50

shimla,This is cool place to visit if you are planning to take a break from hectic city life. Not for the people who would like to see shimla & do shopping rather for the ones who want to relax for couple of days in the lap of nature. The resort is not big rather a small property with only 10 rooms only & a small multi cusine restaurant. The  menu offers wide range of food options & is well prepared. I even got a chance to see their kitchen & was amazed to see the cleanliness in there. For book lovers there is good collection of books. There are games one can play & we enjoyed playing football. Staff is very cooperative & proactive. Overall a very satisfying experience in the hills.,Dhruv S,/Profile/188dhruvs,,50

The place offers serene views and with the massive areas & one can indulge in a lot of activities like trekking , cycling and village visit. Located on NH 22 , this place is one stop you wouldn't want to miss if you plan to rejuvenate away from city's bustling life and living by the countryside where actual life happens.   The best was bonfire with music. We even went to hiking to a nearby hilltop & the sunset was magnificent.The owners of the resort are very accommodating & personally look into the guests needs.

We were warmly welcomed upon arrival. Cheerful, friendly staff, new building, spacious rooms & large space outside rooms actually gives you comfortable feeling.  Restaurant was flexible, lot of activities for kids to enjoy themselves and very cordial and friendly staff. We had 2 evenings here and it was truly a bliss to be in the lap of nature with this hospitality.

Food of all varieties is available and if not they don't hesitate to customise it. I recommend Malabar Chicken or Kohlapuri Chicken for chicken lovers. We asked for milk for kids, it came straight from their cow farm. There are plenty of areas & games to keep kids busy but we personally loved trekking to nearby hills. They even packed snacks for us to enjoy during our trek. The staff is very courteous & made us feel at home.
