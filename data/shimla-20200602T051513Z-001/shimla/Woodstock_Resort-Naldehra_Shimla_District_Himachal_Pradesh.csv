Narendra Verma regarding his hospitality services and I actually realized the same when we reached at the resort. He is truly a gentle guy and provided us upgraded room even though I had booked it for the base room. Food of this resort should never be missed by guest who comes to stay at this resort. Preparation of food along with presentation was very nice.   This is a very nice property located at a serene place and has a worth for money and very closeby to Golf Course. One should never expect luxurious rooms but it has all what a resort should have. Beds and other furnitures are intact and good. I can't forget to mention that Sh.

shimla,"It was time once again to go on a family trip and like always I chose an offbeat place called Naldehra. Had heard a lot about the place and it’s picturesque scenes.  We stayed at the WoodStock resort and had an enjoyable and pleasant stay. The deluxe room had a great view full of dense deodars and green mountains. The food served was also of homely taste. We enjoyed a good get together and team building games organised by Mr. Narender, the manager of the resort. The resort itself is located among a dense green forest filled with deodars and the air was so pure out there. We loved it.  We did water rafting in the river Sutlej, along with horse riding in the vicinity of the golf course. I recommend the resort due to its mystical location and good accommodation facilities.

This is indeed a hidden gem, a quaint property surrounded on all sides by trees and hills. The room we stayed in was Super Deluxe which had a sitting area by the windows with breathtaking views of the Shimla hills. The manager and his staff totally pampered us. They arranged a trip for us to Tattapani what has a beautiful lake. In the evening we enjoyed a bonfire and snacks. The food was simple yet homely and delectable.

The only issue someone might face is with the location as it is almost an hour drive from Shimla and a little isolated. But if one loves such secluded area its the best place. The second thing might be the overly priced food menu. I mean I understand that it's not very easy to run a hotel in such an area with cheap food but at least the price should have been little reasonable.

shimla,Such a nice hotel it was and the awesome nature view cant be described in words. And being in a little outer area from shimla city the complete place becomes  haven. It is really hard to find such beautiful place that is situated completely in lap of nature. The staff from key owner Mr. Paramjeet to manager & the Mr. Cook completely take cares about each single thing u want. Another best part was food. They wont put any limitations on customers with their food menu. They can serve anything to everything u want to eat. All thing collaborate and made my weekend completely fantastic. I definitely long to be there again in winters too. ,752sudhirk,/Profile/752sudhirk,,50
shimla,"I went with my family considering the great reviews of this property. No doubt the place is peaceful, calm and quite. We stayed in deluxe rooms which are OK sized. Some renovation work is under-going so they did not look so clean, but OK overall. Bathrooms were clean and hot water facility. The staff is friendly but they are NOT at all professional. They are not fit to be in the hospitality industry. They say 'yes' to everything but 'NEVER' served things on time. I had to go to the kitchen myself to take my stuff several times. I had to literally plead to them to start preparing my dishes. Once the food was finally prepared, it tasted well. They forgot the orders, delivered less items, forgot spoons with tea and then never returned. Had a very tough time dealing with the staff.",virag2003,/Profile/virag2003,"Melbourne, Australia",30
shimla,When it comes to your stay there are always speculations that how it is going to be irrespective of how many reviews you have read and how much rating it might have. The same went true for us. It was a change of our plan from the 25th Sep Weekend to 2nd Oct Weekend and we had to part away with our initial bookings near Main Shimla. And the search began there afterwards. Either there was no availability or prices were not justified. Finally after not much search we landed at this property through TripAdvisor and GoIbibo. We were looking for three rooms and didn't wanted that one family feel left out. But then we were left with no choice. And I was able to manage three rooms - 2 Family Suites and 1 Super Deluxe Room.

We were so tired after a drive of 10 hours and found out that all Hotels in the area were booked. A shopkeeper in Mashobra suggested to try out this place near Naldehra. We called and ended up speaking to the owner. He said that the place was totally booked but they just had a last minute cancellation. We rushed to the Hotel and were thrilled upon seeing the property. We got a super deluxe room on the top floor. The room had 2 large windows with breathtaking views of the valley and hills.

The staff is extremely helpful and courteous and I was actually surprised  to find out that they offer room service also.The Deluxe room that we stayed in was very spacious and had a nice view. I am very picky about cleanliness and the best part about Woodstock was that the room and especially the bathroom was very clean.

shimla,We stayed for 2 nights three days. Pros- It's an OK place with  good location. It's quite and naturally peaceful. Staff is helpful. But less in number.  Went for walks around the resort. Good greenery all around. So kids enjoyed the walks.                                          Now for the cons-  things need to be upgraded in this place. Bed linen was short for the size of bed so it was always crumpled. No shower curtain or format in toilets. We stayed in the suits. The size of the room was very good with seating. Being vegetarian finding food items from a very small menu for all three meals for a family of 6 was really difficult. So same or similar orders were given. Can definitely be improved. ,Vidhu P,/Profile/VidhuP_12,"New Delhi, India",30
