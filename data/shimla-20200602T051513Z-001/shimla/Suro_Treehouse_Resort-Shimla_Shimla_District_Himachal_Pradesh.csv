shimla,"I went here with my wife on our mini honeymoon as we are native to Chandigarh, and stayed at this beautiful resort for a night. I must say that the service, amenities and overall experience was no less than a 5 Star Hotel. The Resort is situated in the interiors of Suro which is 20 kms before shimla. It is absolutely mesmerising and so peaceful that even a drop of water can be heard clearly. The chalets are escalated around 20 feet above the ground level and will give you the perfect feeling of a tree house. Talking about the room interiors and upkeep, it is just magnificent and can't be compared with other hotels. We were initially booking The Oberoi but in the event of searching hotels found this lovely resort and booked it and after staying here we will anytime recommend this",Amandeep Singh,/Profile/aman6490,"Bangalore District, India",50

That staff is extremely courteous and always willing to walk that extra mile for your comfort.  The chalets are wooden, so do expect some creaks and issued with the locks due to changes in weather.

Coming to the food part, the cuisine is mostly Indian, although they do have some Italian & Chinese dishes on their menu.

Also the small sized cottage gives you the perfect tree house feel.   The view is just spectacular. Once there all you can see is nature at it’s best.   Great hospitality too. Although the timings for ordering food is restricted but the lovely staff makes up for it.   One suggestion to the management if they are listening to this. Keep some cup noodles or instant food in the room that you can make at midnight incase one gets hungry.   ,Tarun G,/Profile/713tarung,,50

I had opted for a package with both breakfast and dinner included. Breakfast had fewer options and so did dinner. A foodie would definitely under rate this place.

shimla,It's a new property. Hence clean and modern. It's a different experience. If you are looking for serenity this is the place.  Food could have been slightly better.  Getting there is a bit tricky but worth after u get there. The staff is very helpful. Don't expect any market or mall road around. Won't recommend toddler.  ,97himanshus,/Profile/97himanshus,,40
shimla,"Me and my friends went to suro in the month of june which is the perfect time to go there. We were 5 so we booked the duplex chalet there which was quite fun.  The experience was a little mixed. I am sharing with you the good points & 'improvement required' points for you to decide in a better manner... Goodness: 1. The location is stunningly beautiful, peaceful & quite with best views from almost all rooms  2. The rooms/chalets are raw & beautiful just like a treehouse should be  3. Chilled out staff which is helpful than most of the five stars  4. Really good chef, but only for lunch( dinner buffet isn't that great but you really wont have a choice on that one)  5. The dog 'Brazil' & his best friend cat 'chia'  6. Do try kiwi chutney of 'bagycha' placed on the dining tables",sakshamR,/Profile/sakshamR,"New Delhi, India",40

shimla,"Have been looking out for a tranquil place in the hills (away from the maddening crowds in the hill stations these days) and found this hidden gem. The chalets are tastefully done and offer stunning views of the hills and the valley. Experiencing a 17 degrees (when Delhi is blazing) is bliss !!!  The food though was bit of a disappointment since the spread was limited and had limited cuisines, but the resort and the service make up for the low.   PS : There is no air conditioning in the rooms but they were comfortable with pedestal fans that are provided.",iamfree2fly,/Profile/iamfree2fly,"New Delhi, India",40

shimla,"I visited this place in the first week of june. Lovely place and cottages. Very helpful manager. The cottages are are nice. We intended to stay for 3 nights. But checked out after staying one night as it was too hot.  The location is great, food is ok but you cannot stay here in peak summer. I advised the management to put ACs in the cottages.  Good place to stay, but avoid peak summers as the wooden cottages get real hot!!!!  ",sabuj s,/Profile/sabujs,delhi,30
shimla,"Once again with prices soaring and every place in the country booked,I was looking for a not so touristy kinda stuff. While surfing on innumerable sites we happened to come across this Treehouse Resort which was trending as New. I like the direct approach and called up and yet again we were pleasantly surprised to get a great deal for 4 days and five nights from Raman ,who manages the property and has been involved with the project since its inception. The property is 18 Kms short of Shimla and loc 4 Kms on a tangent in Kathlighat. You have to be there to see it. Nestled in mother natures lap it is surrounded by Deodhar and Cheer forests and is away from civilisation. They have eight beautifully appointed chalets built in Pine wood and every small detail has been taken care off.",Ashwani_Vasishtha,/Profile/Ashwani_Vasishtha,"New Delhi, India",50
shimla,"This was the most memorable stay during my recent trip to Shimla. The treehouse is at an excellent location not far( just 4 km.) from the main Shimla highway. The chalet made of finest wood situated on a cliff gives a thrilling experience. We stayed in a duplex chalet which was worth every penny. The peace loving people would certainly love this property which is away from noise of traffic. The serene environment filled with sound of birds and wind chimes gives it a mesmerising touch. The Manager Mr. Raman and other staff takes care of all guests personally. Indoor games facilities like carom, chess are available in the room and TT/Badminton outside. Other facilities like swimming pool and spa etc. are being developed. Food preparation quality may be improved little bit however",Raj-K-Arora,/Profile/Raj-K-Arora,"Ghaziabad, India",50

shimla,"Spent time here – 3 days in May 2016. Good location off-Road from NH 22 just shy of Shoghi which itself is a suburb of Shimla. Developed / built up area is tastefully done, the independent Chalets (they call it) - essentially small Cabins / Cottages – made almost entirely from the Wood, nice clean bathroom and shower, running hot and cold water, TV, refrigerator, large Windows – it has everything. Small but aesthetically done. There is a patio too with a bench and a table in all Cabins with a clear view of the surrounding hills, trees and the valley below (you can even see Shimla train moving thru the hills many times a day).   To top it all wonderful team led by Raman Prakash. Easy to speak too, smiling and ever ready to help. Must name a few of the staff too – Vijay, Raj Kumar",Serengati,/Profile/Serengati,,50

shimla,"Suro Treehouse is a true gem, a rare find. Deep into the woods, the place is as authentic (with its 100% eco-friendly design), as it is modern, with most amenities and comforts. Its unbelievable how traditional sensibilities can be preserved so well and beautifully married with contemporary hospitality. So perfectly designed, staying here almost feels like staying somewhere abroad.  One can choose to just rest and absorb the serenity here, indulge in leisure games, or go for nature walks/treks and bike rides. No matter what you do, the experience is detoxifying at the least.",Divya,/Profile/divyasharma84,"New Delhi, India",50

The owners have really paid attention to detail- from the gorgeous wood interiors to the minimal but very comfortable facilities and even the suggested trails for short treks nearby.
