shimla,"I was looking or a pet friendly place in Mashobra and picked Mahasu House. It was a real lucky find. All I can say for other intending visitors is that one has to actually be there and soak in the experience of this place to appreciate what a well laid out property with properly trained staff can do for your holiday.  Mahasu House is not constrained for space, as a matter of fact, it spoils you with its large, well- appointed rooms, an indoor dining space, a separate seating area and a library, plus terraces with more than adequate seating for you just to sit and enjoy the stunning views; and a separate terrace for breakfast. Since there are just 6 rooms, there can be a maximum of 6 families at a time, basking in the attention of the staff members.

The view is great if you take the room overlooking the valley. There are heaters in the bed mattress, so it is very cozy even in winter. The game room is nice to spend an afternoon or late evening, after sunset. The staff go out of their way to make you comfortable.

It is a grand house, looks quite new in construction, and has 6 rooms - four of the rooms are in a side annexe (2 on the 1st floor, 2 on the ground floor), and two rooms are in the main building. There is a magnificent lounge (we didnt use this as we have small kids), and a large dining room right at the house entrance, with a large black wood table (we understand this is used for meals when the winter closes in!).  Since there were 4 of us (2 adults, 2 kids of 14 & 9)we were in room 6 - this room is at the very top of the house, under the gables.

shimla,"I along with my husband and son visited mahasu house this month. Though rooms are excellent.  We had to catch flight from shimla early morning, accordingly we informed the hotel staff. In the morning when we got up and walked downstairs to take the taxi we found that there was no staff in the hotel and darkness all around. It may be concluded that hotel has a policy of keeping no staff in the night. If there is any emergency one can imagine the plight of the guest. In the day time also there is no conveyance.. What to talk about night. The hotel is located in the secluded place with no houses nearby. This is highly an irresponsible behaviour by the hotel staff. Hotel Management is requested to improve this aspect ASAP. ",Ruchi M,/Profile/964ruchim,,30

The owners are friendly and come and have a chat with you which gives your stay a homely feel. My kids are ready to go back again. All the staff seem eager to serve you. A seven star experience.

shimla,Stayed a night during May at Mahasu House with Family. Here is my take on some of the key aspects   Location & Property : The location is away from the crowds and the last 3 Km ride through the best of nature and lush green trees. The property is beautiful and has been built with a lot of care and thought . The view from the decks is beautiful and I could see the snowcaps of Dhauladhar range clearly with my field binoculars .  Room : The rooms are spacious and elegant and sport colonial style furniture and large glass windows overlooking the valley . Overall give a luxurious feel and comfortable sleep and shower ( it worked better than many top star stays )   Service : This is the aspect that a lot of properties go wrong with and I must say that the quality of staff and service,Saurabh_Gu,/Profile/Saurabh_Gu,"Mumbai, India",50

Interiors were classy, comfortable and it was easily noticeable how much thought had gone into each and every small detail. The rooms were comfortable. Food was great and hygiene was impeccable.

shimla,"We reached 1 Km short of Mashobra after wading through rather heavy traffic of Shimla on the 19th July 2013 when Mahasu House manager - Mr. Anil Sharma informed me on my cell phone that we need to take the left side diversion on a road going into the woods. I was very apprehensive and cursing myself when I took this jungle road which was largely unmetalled and that too on a rainy afternoon. After driving for about 15-20 minutes (about 4 Km), we arrived at Purani Koti where Mahasu House is located. On entering the house both me and my wife said Wow! What a place - a heaven in the wilderness of hills! We were warmly greeted by the manager of the house - Mr. Anil Sharma and his ever helpful staff. We were escorted to Room No.2 on the ground floor with a full glass window each on",ThaparNK,/Profile/ThaparNK,"Ambala, India",50
shimla,"We chose Mahasu for a small team offsite and believe me ' awesome' was the feeling when we all checked out. Though we were there (6 of us) for only 2 nights but I think the place deserves at least 6 nights stay. Amazing views , good nice rooms and fab food ...... This place is not only good for  family vacations but also equally good for small corporate gatherings / offsites as well. The Gym , Club Room and Steam Sauna are good additions...one suggestion a small spa can be there to unwind and relax.... All in all this place deserves a repeated visit if possible once every year...",Raghavendra,/Profile/Raghavendra311,"New Delhi, India",50
shimla,"Don’t be fooled by the plush rooms, massive flat screen TVs, tea/coffee maker, power shower and bathroom amenities and believe that you have arrived at any five-star hotel. You might be forgiven to think like this upon entering one of the 6 bedrooms at Mahasu House. But this little gem of a property nestled in the forests of Mashobra 40-minutes beyond Shimla is actually the hill-house we’ve always wanted.  Our large party including three tiny-tots took up almost the entire place, and Mr Anil Sharma’s staff could not do more to make us feel at home. One thing that strikes you when you get there is that there is no menu, so the kitchen is happy to plan meals around your likes and dislikes. This was the clincher for us because of the kids. Every morning we would take breakfast on",siddmohan,/Profile/siddmohan,"New Delhi, India",50

shimla,"Mahasu house is one of the most beautiful properties. Superbly located and politely staffed. Has good in house facilities. Surprisingly the food is very good and homely. The owner Anil Walia is  warm and caring. A good human. When my grand son wanted to have a Pizza, he got italian food made for all in the evening, which was excellent and he knows what food is all about. Rooms are very cosy and tastefully done. With all standard amenities. Im told they have snow all over in winters and that they are installing central heating shortly. Im already planning another holiday to Mahasu Hse, hopefully this winter. May be with friends on new year. Im so impressed with this small and wonderful property that Ive already recommended this to my friends and relatives.

Well equiped with activities for all age groups. Excellent food.... The quality, the prepration, the presentation etc.... Out of the world. Highly recommended to all visitors. A must visit place.

shimla,"We were in Mahasu house for 2 nights - May 30th & 31st. We drove in from a camping/trekking experience at Sangla Valley (HP) and were pleasantly surprised to find a property with only 6-7 rooms which could be as well equipped and as carefully designed as this. Anil Walia the owner of the property and resident of Shimla, hired a well renowned Manali architect to build his hill-station property which I must say has all the modern comforts and entertainment (including snooker table, carrom board, Table Tennis, Karaoke and a Gym equipped with steam, sauna and jacuzzi) and at the same time retains the old-world charm of the Shimla region. The rooms are very modern with high quality beddings, wooden flooring, LCD TVs, large bathrooms with high quality bath and basin fittings.

All i have to say is I try my level best to visit there atleast twice a year as my second home away from the urban routine.......I can never forget its hospitality and friendly attitude of the staff. Simply my best home place within nature. There is no other location in Mashobra where people can drive a short distance and be swept away with scenic vistas...",Kavita K,/Profile/KavitaK952,"New Delhi, India",50

The rooms are very clean, the service exceptional, extremely child friendly, food is great and the experience splendid.  The best room is the corner one on the first floor, if u have kids between 3-8,then the second floor room is also good. It's closest to the attic which is a kids hangout.

shimla,"During first week of May 2013, we had an opportunity to stay at this property for four nights, and it turned out to be an excellent choice. In all the aspects we had a fulfilling experience. Very well appointed rooms, brilliant food with great choices and above all most helpful and courteous staff. The owner of the property takes personal interest and interacts with all the guests, which gives you feeling of importance. The main town Shimla is not far away hence you can have best of both.

shimla,"We went in the month of April, 2013 for two nights. I selected this hotel after reading all of the 7 reviews there were on TripAdvisor at that time. My review is no different than the popular opinion here. This is an excellent property.   Location: Appropriately located. Away from the town hustle bustle but still close enough. Would have been the only resort in the vicinity initially. But one or two resorts are coming up nearby which could block the views a little bit.  Property: Very nicely made. All rooms are different from each other. Large spacious rooms, comfortable bed (WITH BUILT IN HEATING), immaculately clean washrooms, toiletries from Khadi, hair dryer also in the bathroom. Rooms have LED, Tata Sky, DVD player, heater, clean white linens, kettle with tea and coffee",Jasmeet Singh B,/Profile/JasmeetB,Ludhiana,50

Starting from huge exquisite rooms with selected furniture, amazing food, all outdoor and indoor games arrangement, bonfire, tandoor/grill arrangement, good music, great view of the hills while you are on bed!(the list goes on and on!) it has all you can think of... To top this all the place has tremendous warmth and hospitality. The manager himself makes sure that all the guests are comfortable. Highly recommended.  Only drawback: 3 miles of approach road to this place is not good. But as they promised that would be fixed soon.",SharmisthaGupta,/Profile/SharmisthaGupta,"Nashua, New Hampshire",50
shimla,"We spent a night at Mahasu house at the end of a short trip from Mumbai to the hills. Truly wished we had spent our entire holiday at Mahasu. The excellent service starts from the time your car reaches their gates! The House has 7 bedrooms and we were given a tour of the place. Rooms are squeaky clean and even the towels were scented. The corner rooms have lovely views of the valley and it was a pleasure to wake up early every morning to the mist covered mountains. Our kids (ages 3-6) loved the playroom in the attic. We left them in the care of the staff for about an hour while we took a walk in the woods nearby and they had a great time. They even have a games room with a TT and Pool table and a Gym, which we never found the time to use. There is a bit of construction activity",Vasantha G,/Profile/Vasanthag,Mumbai,50

shimla,"We chose Mahasu House after seeing the link on a friend's FB page and in fact, cancelled a booking at The Oberoi Cecil to do so. And having just returned from there after spending 3 nights last week, i am only too glad that i did change my bookings. Everything was superb..the property, rooms, view, staff, service and food. There is very clear signage to get to the resort. The last 3.5kms is unlevelled road but it takes not more than 15 minutes to clear that stretch. The proximity from Shimla makes it a convenient stop,away from the madness and yet reachable in half an hour. The biggest usp of Mahasu House would be its staff. Extremely courteous, efficient and competent. The chef needs special mention as we found the food superlative!

shimla,"We decided to go to Mashobra on an impulse as school holidays had got extended by a week  It's apt as  a weekend getaway from Delhi/NCR. I had some misgivings since I was more eager to visit Shimla as Mashobra is little know for tourism. but I'm thankful that I did not change the location. It's only about 45 kms uphill from Shimla but so different & better both in topography, climate and of-course the crowd! In fact we saw no one here except for the locals and the labours repairing the roads to Mahasu House, our abode for three days! situated at the top of a hill, beautiful surroundings, miles and  miles of greenery, some personal apple orchards and flora abounds as do a lot of monkeys:) Wonderful to wake up in a modern room with birds chirping and blue skies.

This turned out to be a blessing in disguise! We came across Mahasu House online; the pictures looked great and we booked the place but we were definitely skeptical.   As we reached Mashobra,  the approach road to Mahasu house itself promised a different holiday- pulling us away from the madding crowd. It was lovely cold, much colder than Shimla, just the whole point of going to the mountains in the summers, isn't it?! We entered Mahasu house and were stunned to find that the pictures don't do justice to the place- its beautiful, very elegantly done up, wide, warm, open- big hearted.The",anuj_mittal,/Profile/anuj_mittal,"New Delhi, India",50

The living area, the dining area and the patio are just an extension of your own home space. The view from the entire property is scenic and very peaceful. The staff is extremely warm and helpful.

Nowhere we've been to in the hills until now beats the experience at Mahasu. Will upload pictures soon.",BhanuG,/Profile/BhanuG,Gurgaon,50
