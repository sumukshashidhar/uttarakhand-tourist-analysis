From arranging small things like milk for my infant in the midnight hours to get anything while stay. A wonderful stay.

Now coming to the hotel, the place looks pretty good and has a restaurant and a charming lobby and good service from the hotel staff. We were given a nice room which was large and had a balcony attached which gave a great view.

I didn't & to our horror it was right at top of bus station. Once you reach the hotel on fourth level you will be surprised with nice ambiance & neat furniture they have done at the lobby. The rooms are quite big. There were reviews of noisy from Buses below, but we didn't face such issues. The interior of the room was quite unique & hotel staff were attentive to your calls.

shimla,We visited this hotel in February 2015 without much of the research about the vicinity and exact location.  Inside Hotel: Hotel is nice with good rooms. Food was also ok when you dont have anything available outside. View from balcony is beautiful however only at horizontal or vertical level. Don't look down as you will see lot of buses and passengers roaming. :) This hotel is situated above an ISBT (Inter State Bus Terminal) and a deserted shopping mall (Please dont be think about shopping as there is hardly an shop in this shopping mall). You will hear lot of bus horns and bus conductors shouting calling passengers hence we had to keep our doors closed. Hotel has enough parking space hence we didn't find any issues.

(c) Cots will break your back.  And the worst part of it is the parking which is not hotel owned and is shared by the shopping complex (on 3rd floor) and the hotel. In my case, what I observed was that the parking lot is managed by bunch of local goons. They will give priority to the shopping complex car parkers who pays them than the hotel passengers who park for free.  When I came to park my car in the evening, they kept me waiting outside the parking lot for at least 15 minutes.

shimla,Located at new Bus stand in Shimla (ISBT). We reached late night from Chandigarh so the ONLY good part was that we need not to struggle for reaching the place.  However reaching the Hotel floor was a big challenge as lift was not working and no clear way by stairs also.  Rooms are spacious but Beds are not comfortable.  You just cannot sleep the whole night as Buses will keep Honking all night and it gets worse as the morning rises. You just cant relax for a single minute.

shimla,"Dont go by the photos uploaded by hotel team this hotel is small part of that building  , we checked into this hotel 6th Jan 14  we surprise to see that this hotel is located exactly above  the local bust stand , it was embracing moment when we went along with family ,  you cannot lock your room inside there is no latch , the heater which provided by hotel team is worst . rooms are smells very bad . I advice  all online trip advisors to rate this hotel badly  .",naveend05,/Profile/naveend05,"Mangalore, India",10
shimla,"Goods: Big Rooms, Nice bed, and nice sofa, Good lighting, view from windows as great. Room service was a bit slow... Nice restaurant, good staff.  Can be improved: Room Heater were not sufficient in winters and they could not provide even asking. Bit far from Mall road (round 5 KM).   Overall good hotel with good food with good staff...We enjoyed our stay!!",Sridhar K,/Profile/756sridhark,"Vadodara, India",40
shimla,"The hotel rooms are nice, big and clean. The restaurant service is a bit slow so order well ahead n order for room delivery rather than dining in restaurant. Is a bit far from Mall rd but you can get a taxi from hotel to drop n pick for about 500 INR. Ample parking space..overall enjoyed my stay.. N just to add in, I got hotel booked via cleartrip - I compared rates for same hotel on several sites n cleartrip provided the best ones..thanks cleartrip.",Pranxraj,/Profile/Pranxraj,"New Delhi, India",40
shimla,"I stayed here on Dec 23 - Dec 24. It is located slightly away from the city center and right above the New Shimla bus stand. The staff was very good and the rooms were nice and clean, There is a multiplex and a coffee day in the same building. I did not like the room heater provided as it was very small and definitely not effective. The hotel management can definitely do something on this regard. Otherwise, a great hotel to stay.  Pros: Nice rooms, Good staff Cons: No centralized heating. A small room heater is provided which is not really effective when the temperature hits sub zero levels. Also keeping the room heater on the whole night makes you uncomfortable.",Rajeesh R,/Profile/RajeeshR,"Bengaluru, India",40
shimla,stayed for a night. Good hospitality and service. The only drawback which was experience that from parking to go to hotel reception you are not able to find the way from where to go.        Put proper signs.       ,Kamal C,/Profile/Kamal190962,"New Delhi, India",40
shimla,It's there in new bus terminal that's one of the best advantages. Rooms are awesome. They very clean n hygienic. They need improve their kitchen service as staff there are not so kind and quick in service.,Shashidhar N,/Profile/shashidharn,,40
shimla,"The best part of this place is that despite being just above ISBT, it is sound proof, and u feel away from the noise of the city. Amazing views from Window of your room. We waited for about an hour to get the room of our choice, with the big windows from and amazing valley view. Great staff, the room was newly constructed, excellent bedding, great food, buffet or a-la-carte, whatever you choose. I have been to shimla 3-4 times but this was the best stay I ever had in shimla.",VarunS03,/Profile/VarunS03,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",50

shimla,"I booked ck international through makemytrip and it was indeed a very good choice of place to stay. This hotel is within the vicinity of bus stop and a mall, so I feel noise may be a bit of problem during peak days. We stayed here from 6th - 8th Nov. This is located very conveniently close to city, yet far from the hustle bustle. Staff could be a bit more curteous, although they were really friendly. As the hotel is new, they had provided us with a small heater which was actually too small for the size of room they had. Overall a good experience and I wish them all the best to better the ambiance for days to come. Looking forward for future stays with this hotel",Ameet Babrekar,/Profile/ABabrekar,"Mumbai, India",50
shimla,"I recently went on a family trip to Shimla and stayed here for 6 Nights. The hotel is on top of the new ISBT, about 4-5 kms from the Mall Road. While most people would think that this distance can be a deterrent in the hills, it was not so as there are local city buses leaving every 15 minutes for the city and you can reach the Mall Road in 10 minutes flat and without much expense. Rooms are large, neat and clean. Staff is very courteous and restaurant food is good.   Added advantage is the presence of a modern SRS cinema on the 2nd floor- you feel like watching the latest movie at night , you can do that easily. There is also a CCD on the 2nd floor, where you can enjoy a cup of coffee.  There's ample parking if you are driving from outside.",trespasseronline,/Profile/trespasseronline,"New Delhi, India",50
shimla,"I had booked Hotel C K International directly through phone and I got the best rates from there. The experience was simply superb...staff extremely cordial and warm...hospitality built on strong ethos of Indian culture---""Atithi Devo Bhava"", where one felt being treated to extra-ordinary and esteem. Food and service was excellent  and I can still savour the taste in my mouth after reaching my house. Great Restaurant, huge lobby , could well drive-in straight up to the lift of the hotel with ample parking space. Truly a class experience...!!!",rkbhatia,/Profile/rkbhatia,Punjab,40
shimla,"I chose this place for our stay after going through the reviews posted on trip advisor and must say it was the right decision. This is an ideal hotel for couples as well as for families.  Location: Hotel is located at very nice, clam and peaceful place with very well maintained and clean rooms. . Room is equipped with ultramodern amenities.  Service: The service is excellent, hotel staff is extremely good.   Food: The food is awesome here and being vegetarian, I will say this as best combo for breakfast / Lunch / Dinner.  We loved this place. Overall it was a wonderful experience and would recommend this hotel to friends.",AMIT C,/Profile/AMITC838,"Navi Mumbai, India",50
shimla,"Located on 4th floor of Modern ISBT, when you exit the lift, you are greeted by a huge lobby area. No wonder, it has come up recently only, so the property is good and maintained.   We were 3 friends, checked-in on 12-Oct 2013 and checked out on 14-Oct-2013. Had taken one room with extra bedding and CP (room+bfast for all 3).  The rooms are spacious, beautiful and have a nice view. But their bathing area was funnily small for an adult.   At the initial level, the staff seemed to be really courteous and willing to help. But that feeling was very short-lived.   The room service was one of the most pathetic I have seen anywhere, the guy who was receiving the calls was arrogant and non-responsive; most of the times we had to call at least twice or thrice before getting anything",Tushar J,/Profile/326tusharj,"New Delhi, India",30
