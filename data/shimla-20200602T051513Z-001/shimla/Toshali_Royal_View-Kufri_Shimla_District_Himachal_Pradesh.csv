shimla,"The property is remotely situated between Chail and Kufri. When I wrote remotely, I mean it literally. It’s a massive property that cannot be missed. I booked Royal double valley room that was actually quite a small room. The washroom was also below average. I upgraded it to suite later on.   The rooms offer beautiful view but it’s of no use because there is a huge problem of Monkeys in this resort. You simply cannot stand in the balcony because they are always there. So basically you are confined to your room.   The breakfast and dinner was quite good. The taste of food of authentic and even the portion size was decent.   Overall a good property for one night stay. ",Pathfynder,/Profile/Pathfynder,"Jaipur, India",40

The breakfast spread was good and the food served in the room was hot and delightful.  The hotel needs to work a bit on the amenities especially the gym and the playing area.

They have only suite rooms on this floor. Their suite rooms are cheaper than regular rooms of most other hotels. Beautiful rooms with a view. Bathrooms could have been better though.

Zeroed on this one due to its location purely on photos but was apprehensive about the service and facilities. I am pleasantly surprised at the courteous nature of each and every staff member that we came across in our 3 nights stay.

Mr Mohan took us out for a morning 4KM hike and explained in detail about the surroundings. The room service is good as well. Food is fine.

shimla,Been there with family although the hotel needs urgent renovation and upkeep. Rooms need soundproofing as you can hear voices from adjoining rooms. Would suggest avoid going on long weekends as the drive can be tiring it took my almost 10 hours from Delhi road from Kandaghat and Solan are bad and you have to go through Shimla which adds 40 kms and 90 minutes to your drive.   I am giving 3 stars to the property only because of the staff courtesy otherwise would have given only 2 stars. I would like to thank Mohan person who took care of the games room and sung songs with us on karaoke a special thanks to chef Sajid who served us fresh chicken tikkas.
