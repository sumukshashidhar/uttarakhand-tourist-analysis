shimla,We stayed at Landmark hotel for 2 nights in end of February 2020.The hotel is clean ...welcoming and efficient staff ...food was good with a good amount of helping for the price . The rooms are well heated with hot water in bathroom 24 hours.  The view from our room was awesome.Room service was also very good. We had a great time . Will definitely recommend it to people who are ready to walk 1km to reach mall road,Dr Taral,/Profile/bhtar,,40
shimla,I stayed at this hotel in Feb 2020. The location is not at Mall road. The elevator at the hotel takes you to the road going toward Mall road. You have to walk atleast 10 mins to reach the Mall road. Hotel location is good if you are going by your car.  Rest everything is also good. The breakfast could have been a bit better.,jn_ankit1990,/Profile/jn_ankit1990,"New Delhi, India",30

shimla,This hotel is an excellent place to stay with your family. It has great rooms with an amazing view. The breakfast and food is yummm and the staff was kind enough to make it as per our tastes.  The staff is super friendly and always available for help. The lift is a boon as it takes you to the same level as mall road.   You need to yet walk to mall road which is a 10 minute walk (A little difficult as you need to climb a hill) but you get used to it in a few days.  The travel agency at the concierge are also very helpful to take you around to Shimla.  Overall a very good experience.,Iman F,/Profile/IF1602,"Mumbai, India",50
shimla,"Very good Hotel with private parking facilities and the top floor is right on the Mall road. This is not so common in Shimla. However, you got to walk for some good 15-20 mins uphill to reach the attractions like Scandal Point, Ridge, etc.,. Rooms offer a good view of the valleys, have centralized AC, prompt service. The food menu is not so expensive. Breakfast spread is decent but we didn't enjoy the food so much.",Deepak Raj Srinivasan,/Profile/deepakrajs,"Bengaluru, India",50

shimla,I stayed with my colleague on a business trip to Shimla for one night in the month of August 2019. Overall the Hotel was good comfortable place to stay near Victory Tunnel - old property and perhaps needs some updating on furniture. 15/20 min walking distance to Mall Road - Hotel Lift has access on the Mall Road. The room had a good view as well. The food served in the Restaurant was good with decent portion sizes and at reasonable prices. The buffet breakfast included in the tariff was also quite ok but lacked in variety of spread. It was worth the price we paid for on MMT - the Hotel was giving room at much higher rate and as such booked it on MMT from the Hotel Lobby. Would not mind staying here again for a night or so on business trip.,MilindKshirsagar,/Profile/MilindKshirsagar,"Mumbai, India",40
shimla,I stayed 16 to 18 September. However I left early on 17th Evening only. But to be honest  I like this place alot. Breakfast Less quantity of food. But quality of food mind blowing. Service Top class.  One person who took my ‚ù§Ô∏èüôà. I don't know his name but he's God at that point of time for me. I checked in at 14:00 and left that place around 14:30 as I have to Kufri and chail. While returning am facing seviour pain in my shoulders and back. As I am riding bike almost 120 KM. WHEN I returned I asked to deliver #Move or Volini but all shops were closed. I pissed off Person who came to my room returned my money back he saw me and replied Sir I am sorry all shops closed nothing is available but if you want I will give my personal pain relief gel to you.

shimla,"We stopped over at Shimla on the way to Spiti valley, and on the return journey too. This is a decent hotel, with a nice view of the town, and spacious rooms. Most importantly, it had a car access from near Victoria Tunnel, and an elevator that opened onto the Mall Road. The distance till the Scandal point is not too short in the mid-day heat, but for evening walks its fantastic. If you can not walk a couple of kms, then it may be a bit difficult, but for us, it was perfect. We chose this after going through several hotels, and even though their parking lot is not huge, and every person in the reception was not ""super warm"", but both times they gave us good rooms on the 4th floor, overlooking the hills and a part of the town.

Food is ok because dinner we tried at night is great but  breakfast at both days are ok. Options are quite few . there is also parking facility available at hotel but limited . Main thing is lift , LIFT OPENED AT ROAD WHICH GOES TO MALL ROAD ... BUT ITS 1.5 KM FROM MALL ROAD/RIDGE AND ROAD TO THAT IS LIKE CLIMB UP to mountains. I have booked super deluxe rooms but what i get is an room which is An  FULLY AC but its surrounded  from walls from all sides . So i feel congestion . So my suggestion is to you guys is that please check before  booking whether they will provide window/ balcony in that category or not to you .

shimla,"Hotel Landmark is very conveniently located next to Victory tunnel. The hotel has ample covered parking space for people like me who prefer to travel by their own car. The hotel has around 100 rooms spread over 5 floors. It also has a bar and restaurant. The food served in the hotel is quite good in terms of both quality and quantity, prices are also reasonable. The hotel provides direct access to the mall road through their elevator, however, the main mall road market is at a distance of about 800 metres, with a slight acclivity while heading towards the mall road, which is a little on the higher side if you are travelling with elders or children.

Hotel hardly cares about customer feedback as they are located on mall road an will get clients anyway. I believe the owners of property dont pay personal attention to their business. Interiors of room dont give premium feel. We stayed in honeymoon deluxe room and booked 3 rooms. Their travel desk is worst. Hotel reception themself recommend to book from outside which is actually right, the guy at travel desk is a cheat, he talks nicely with commitments and then later you will regret booking with him when cab wont come or come very late.

Only good thing about the hotel is that it is on the Mall Road, you can walk through the Mall road easily.   Further, the hotel is quite expensive (Rs 4000/-) for the given set of amenities. I didn't tried food at the hotel, which was again costlier one. We ordered food from outside.

shimla,We stayed in landmark for one day as we were near to Shimla. The reviews had us belive that the hotel has amazing views and this was the primary reason we booked the hotel (at a 3 star price). Our room (supposedly a family room) faced a road and some dirty shacks and hence we were disappointed as soon as we entered our rooms. Our request for a better view room was declined due to availability constraints.  The room and breakfast were as per expectations. The hotel has a covered parking which is a rarity in Shimla and the lift takes you to a spot which is a 10 minute walk from Mall road.

Just 1 soap in the name of toiletry in bath room after u pay 4500/- and treated as if they have done a favour to you by giving room?  3. At checkin and checkout, people expect and even ask minimum 100/- tip for luggage shift which I felt is bad for hotel and categorises to cheap category hotel for me.

Before checking in, I had specifically sent 3 mails requesting for 2 adjacent rooms on the 4th floor with mountain-view. The pictures on Goibibo showed nice well appointed rooms that looked very modern.  On checking in, we were given rooms on the 2nd floor where the mountain-view is partially blocked.

The hotel has great location as you can get put directly on the mall road by lift, you may wonder what's great about this but the terrain of Shimla is such that you may have to walk/climb to reach Mall road from other place.  The hotel has great view on the hillside (opposite to Mall road).  The 2 negatives are the price as the ambience and maintenance of the hotel does not justify the cost and of course the food which needs lot of improvement.

When he got it to our room he hid one of the umbrellas on his caddie and said he's only received one umbrella to give.

The hotel staff is well spoken and courteous.  One point that tourist must be beware of is that there are some agents which stand outside this hotel and on approaching them they will float the price up.  Instead approach the reception and talk directly to their staff at the counter and not just anyone around.

The lift takes us to the sixth floor which has an exit to the Mall road. It was extremely convenient to do all our shopping given the fact that no cars go beyond a particular point at Mall road.   Our delux room had an excellent view of the valley. The rooms were clean and the waiters very friendly. The bathrooms do not have a bath tub but rest all is fine..  Overall a great pick for the money you pay.. ( Costs approx Rs. 4300 per room per night inclusive of",amitprab,/Profile/amitprab,Mumbai,40
shimla,"I and my wife booked this hotel for 3N/4Ds from makemytrip.com.  The hotel staff was not at all friendly and neither their body language was warm. The lobby was very repulsive and the food was aweful. The food charges were ridiculous and the taste was horrible. The room service boys didn't even have a smile in their face. Instead I found the person sitting on the top floor gaurding the entrance to the mall a bit more cheerful. The only advantage this hotel has is the access to the mall road and for that it is charging exuberant rates. There are better hotels than this in Shimla and one may be tempted to compare Honeymoon inn Shimla and the results will be obvious.  They charge around 3.5 K but donot provide LCD TV, tooth paste, nor a bathtub and they advertise to have WiFi",AroundTheWorld25yrs,/Profile/AroundTheWorld25yrs,"San Francisco, California",20

shimla,I and my wife arrived here in the month of january and were pleased with the hotel amenities and spacious rooms provided. We availed the package of 2N\3Days which costed me to Rs 5000 (Including all taxes and charges). The Food was quite nice to have but was costly. There is a travel desk at the reception which took care of all our trips and sight seeing in Shimla. Driver (Shashi) was well trained and polite during out sight seeing. Our overall experience in Hotel Landmark was pleasant. Need less saying please ask for the good drivers while enjoying the local sight seeing to shimla as they are usually rigid and not supportive !,ec0321,/Profile/ec0321,Mumbai,40
shimla,"The hotel is conveniently located and room service is FAST - they deliver orders on time.  Got taxis arranged through the hotels travel desk on two days - 1 day for visit to Kufri; this case the driver was excellent and drove the car without much of honking and the trip was very comfortable.  For the next day they arranged car to take me and my family to Chail and from there to drop us off to Kalka - the driver (Sashi) seemed to be in too much hurry, driving rashly, talking over the mobile to his girlfriend/wife, not at all bothered about our presence in the car  You can stay at the hotel for sure but definitely check on the driver before hiring a car from them   The hotel is good to stay",EthanLa,/Profile/EthanLa,LA,40
shimla,"Rajat, Chandigarh    We have just returned from a day at the Landmark. The hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service before. The best part is that the hotel is situated at the start of Shimla and the top floor of the hotel opens at the Mall Road. You just need to use the elevator to the top floor and then the Mall Road is at the walking distance. The food preparations are excellent. Expensive but fabulous.   We paid Rs.2990 per night for a room which we thought excellent value.  Overall I would say this is probably one of the the best hotels we have ever stayed in on holiday and I am extremely fussy!",Rajatjain1985,/Profile/Rajatjain1985,Chandigarh,40
shimla,We landed in Shimla and went to the booked company provided holiday home. The holiday home was horrible and we took the help of a local taxi driver to arrive at this hotel.  The room had a wonderful view of the snow peaked mountains. The room was as clean as can be. Linen and all were fresh and cleaned everyday. I think it was still constructed.  PROS    1. Few minutes walk too Mall road center. 2. Food very good. Even though options were less. I found the food in Shimla to be very good. 2. Wonderful views from the room. We were one which was directly facing the snow capped hills.  CONS 1. Restaurant was not good. 2. Not many room service folks.,panickerz,/Profile/panickerz,Bangalore,40

shimla,"It was January and we had just took off to Shimla out of impulse, without any reservation.    Just near Victoria Tunnel, agents flagged down our car and informed about this property. As they had claimed that this hotel has car parking we went to check out the place.    The lobby was big compared to hotels in the hills. Room was really good, with wooden flooring and with a valley view. Though their room service menu was basic, food price was surprisingly reasonable.  But their trump card was access to Mall Road. It was mentioned in the lift that their top floor was 'Mall Road'. We rode the lift to the top floor and it opened on one end of Mall Road. Five minutes walk took us to ridge.  This was amazing as we did not have to hire any cabs to reach mall road.  Tariff was reasonable",Rolingstoneking,/Profile/Rolingstoneking,Gurgaon,40
