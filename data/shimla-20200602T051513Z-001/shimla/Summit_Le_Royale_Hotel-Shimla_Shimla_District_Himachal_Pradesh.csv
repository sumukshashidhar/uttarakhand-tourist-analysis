shimla,"We liked the fact that the hotel was not far from the Mall and Lakkar bazaar. The staff were friendly, polite and helpful.  Room was large.  Only rooms 101 and 102 are on the ground floor.  However, you still need to climb steps from the road to reception. Beds had electric blankets. Breakfast was adequate. Eggs could be ordered.  Perhaps the information about the hotel could indicate that people with knee or age issues would find the location very difficult to manage if having to walk to and from the Mall more than once a day.  Disliked · No Direct number to the hotel rather than the number for the umbrella organisation in Delhi who had gone on holiday when we needed assistance to find the hotel.

shimla,Avoid this hotel. You will need couple of hours to find the location which is also very horrible and time taking. The Manager was also very rude and showed very non co-operative behaviour.  Hot water was also not available for more than a bucket. Geaser would restart only after 15 minutes. Could not open the window to stop monkeys entering the room. Odd location..Rooms and locaiton do not justify the higehr tariff. MUST AVOID.,Vimal,/Profile/vimal_dhruve,,10
shimla,"We stayed in this hotel from 27th to 28th January’20 nights only. We booked two rooms for 2 families. Rooms were good and clean. Room heater was provided but it was in poor condition. Restaurant Staffs were very gentle with good behave. Our rooms were booked including breakfast, but on the first day morning restaurant staff informed that we had to pay our breakfast charges, we contacted in front desk and they said their booking office did not confirm our rooms including breakfast. It was a embarrassed moment for us because our family and kids were already at the restaurant. We had shown our booking papers to them and at last they agreed to give us breakfast.

shimla,"Visited Shimla and decided to stay at Summit Le Royale after reading reviews on Tripadvisor. I was not disappointed!! Check in was smooth and I was quickly taken to my room which was a Premium category room! The room was clean, spacious with 2 single sofas and a double bed. The attached bathroom was huge offering hot and cold water.  The great part about the room was that it was super cozy - there was a room heater present (no extra charges for this unlike most hotels in Shimla) and the bed had electric blankets which were super good for the extremely cold weather. The hotel also has a restaurant which seemed nice; unfortunately I didn't get a chance to eat there as this trip turned out to be a short one. The hotel staff is very courteous and ever smiling.

shimla,"We had booked a room for three days in Summit Le Royale in December end. As mentioned in the hotel's website this is definitely not a 4-star property. It's situated above the ridge and behind the church. It is in a VIP area (God knows what is VIP in this) and hence cars are prohibited. One can drive past rashtrapatu bhavan (The president of India's house) in Delhi, but you can't drive past a district commissioner's house -- Gimme a break.  The only way to drive to the hotel is from sanjauli chowk which is quite far and then you have to take the EXTREMELY NARROW jakhoo road with local taxis coming in full speed and refusing to reverse their cars even a bit.

shimla,Nice property. The Staff and Manager all are very courteous and cooperative. Always tried to give more than 100% to serve us with a smiling face. The rooms are big and all amenities that are required in such a cold weather are present in the rooms. Cleanliness well defined. The corner rooms are offering very nice view of shimla city. We stayed in Room no. 203. Only disadvantage of this hotel is that it is located in a VIP area and so the cars has to reach the hotel through jakhoo road by taking a longer route. They don't have generator. They have their own restaurant inside so you don't need to go out for dinner.,CMAARINDAM,/Profile/CMAARINDAM,"Kolkata, India",50

shimla,it is located very close to the ridge and walkable. Only for taxis it takes a long journey as certain roads are closed for vehicles in the city. Very good breakfast is provided at the hotel. The hotel has 24 hour hot water in the bath room and dedicated heater in the room. these 2 are most important in any hotel in shimla and this hotel has both. Shimla is very expensive in food and transport.  Mr. Rakesh and Mr. Naresh helped us very much during our stay. The response from the room service was good and we could get the food prepared and delivered at 10 pm as well.  It would be good if they can have separate non-smoking rooms.,Karthikeya H,/Profile/KarthikeyaH,,40

shimla,First thing to point out - this place is a nightmare to get to by car!  Good things:  1. Close to Mall Road area 2. Breakfast reasonable (limited choice but good quality) 3. Efficient room service and reasonable prices of food for dinner  Bad things: 1. A hotel with Spa in the name has no spa - this is surely mis-selling and should be changed immediately. The manager agreed he had no spa but seemed least bothered by this! 2. Getting there is a nightmare by car (for the second time) - it took over 45 mins of driving around and stopping at many places to get help to reach. The only phone number we had was for reservations and they rarely answer the phone (and not at all when we were trying while having difficulty finding the place). 3.

You are unable to open the windows due to monkeys so there was no airflow in the room, maybe a fan in the room would be nice.  The bed was large and comfortable with extra blankets and pillow in the cupboard. The Wifi in the room was fast and never dropped out. There were plenty of comfortable chairs in the room. Check-in staff were not too friendly. Food in the evening was good and very large servings, big problem with the restaurant is the opening hours of 8-10 am and 8-10pm.

If you are having kids or elder people. DO NOT TAKE THIS HOTEL. Even young people get tired to reach to hotel. You cannot frequently go and back to this hotel. 2. At this price, you would get better hotel compared to this. They charged much and after paying that amount you are not getting much. Again too much steep. Also, Rooms in the pictures and actual is a totally different thing. Pictures look like amazing but actually is not good. Thumbs down to for the room.

If you have luggage and you need to get to this place by a car / taxi, please do not attempt going to this place. It is a very dangerous route that is additional 6-7 kms since you have to travel slightly off route. No taxi is willing to take you there, and unless the taxi wala is a local, he wont be equipped to drive in those crazy narrow lanes and they will only end up getting harassed by the locals. And anywhere you go, you have to plan at min 20 min walk before you get access to either the lift or a vehicle. The mall road is very close about 10 mins walk.  Now the hotel - Extremely unclean.

I called hotel desk to provide the 4X4 vehicle to reach but the person was unable to provide. we walk almost 45 minutes with full of pain like this was a punishment not a holiday. we stayed 2 days and nights just in room due to no vehicle facility available in this hotel. over all this hotel is not for family. bad .........bad ..........bad.,asifkhan2017,/Profile/asifkhan2017,"Al Madinah Province, Saudi Arabia",10
shimla,Hotel is descent with average room conditions..we got the room was full of moisturized walls.. food is good in the hotel.. one important thing ..the hotel is at a big height(serious slant road) and taxis will charge a lot to drop you there and take lot of time to reach from bus stand or town..if you can climb then its fine.. i will not suggest it for aged people or families(having children) though the service was very good and staff is really very helpful..,agaamit,/Profile/agaamit,"Noida, India",30
shimla,"Property doesn’t fulfil criteria for a four star one. Reaching to the hotel is a task though they have their own parking. Views from the rooms are good but not awesome. Hell lot of improvement is required in room maintenance. However, food tasted good. House-keeping staff was well supportive. Availability of water at all times can be an issue. Found it expensive as per the room & services received. Guest relationship team seems to be quite active as gave my feedback during check-out and received call from them after few days. They apologized for unsatisfactory experience and assured better services in future.",Traveler1384,/Profile/Traveler1384,"New Delhi, India",30
shimla,We had wonderful a stay at Summit Le Royale for 2nights. The interior and facilities at top floor was unique and we just loved it. It is close to Mall road but due to one way traffic we had difficulties approaching this hotel. The foods in breakfast and dinner was very tasty. But just one suggestion a bit more variety in menu would be an ice on the cake.,CHANDAN C,/Profile/CHANDANC161,,40
shimla,"Visited the hotel on 1st week of Jan'17, the approaching road to the hotel is very narrow and steep, the rooms are ok but services and food is pathetic, they mentioned that they have power back which is totally fake they have a UPS only n that is for reception, we stayed without electricity for 2 days from 6-8 January and faced horrible time of my life just because of the Le royal poor managment, my booking was for 4 days and I left hotel after 2 days. never recommend to anyone.",Rahul G,/Profile/rahulg589,,10

The hotel is situated at a hill top. As it was super cold when we visited, the heater was very essential which was provided on request without any charges(other hotels charge for the same) but the standing heater was of little use in the freezing cold. Ample blankets were provided which was very useful.",Resh0688,/Profile/Resh0688,"Mumbai, India",30

shimla,"Visited this hotel on the first week of December 2016. First of all the vehicle doesn't drive till the hotel. Reaching the hotel is a trekking on its own. If you are lucky enough you will get a coolie, but need to negotiate with him. Until you reach the hotel your holiday mood is gone for a toss.  We had to check out from the hotel at 6 in the mrng. The person at the front desk had no info on how to book a cab or how to proceed to a check out. We were late by an hour and a half until we reached our cab.   Bed was not tidy when we checked in. Had to call housekeeping to get it cleaned.  Average food and staff is not friendly.",sapna b,/Profile/907sapnab,"Bengaluru, India",20

The beautiful sun rays of the afternoon beautiful sunset penetrated into the room literally reminded me of HIS creation. Overlooking the green foliage and the mountain's horizon from the big glazed glass window of our hotel room I could also see some interesting exclusive species like monkeys and orangutans. The specious room had beautiful curtain, gud tasteful decor and the bathroom was more spacious then expected. The staff are so friendly they can go to any extent to help you. I have stayed many times in this hotel as my son studies here and I shall stay further when I visit Shimla at Le Royale.",Anil L,/Profile/AnilL124,,50
shimla,This hotel is located right at the heart of The Mall and Lakkar Bazar. These 2 places are within walking distance. One can view ChristChurch from the hotel room. Rooms are clean  and cozy. Food is good. Hotel staffs are friendly and accomodating. The only drawback is the road leading to the hotel.. its a treacherous journey but its an adventure. The hotel and the surrounding scenery makes up for it. Beauty of Shimla and its mountains are breathtaking.,Christina,/Profile/christinajrvw,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",40

Staff were so courteous and always shown warm gesture towards guest. I would definitely recommenced  this property to everybody. I stayed in 301 & 304 both rooms were so cleaned .

Air india had given me no other choice. so i was forced to stay in this hotel. As one of the traveller has reviewed three days back i was given one room at the top floor and they were explaining that the room is of higher cost, but because of shortage in rooms they have given a higher class room to me.Any one staying in the room cannot walk with out bending through the room. after complaining they agreed to change the room on the second day. The location of this hotel is also not so great and the parking area is a night mare for drivers.

Two persons can hardly walk freely without enjuring one's head. Moreover a lot of monkeys are around over there. And when they jump over the tin roof, it makes horrible sound..! Unfortunately it was heavily raining on that night with a lot of wind, adding some more terrible sounds..! It was really a nightmare for us..! On multiple requests for change in the room, we were given it on the last night as if it was a great mercy to us.!

shimla,"On the positive side, this hotel is very close to the Mall, the centre of Shimla city. It is only a 5 mins walk to the Church, but on your way back the road is steep and you may need to take a few pause during the short walk.  The portal that I used to book this hotel mentioned this hotel as a 4 star property, but I do not believe the facilities provided are matching anyway near that. Let me clarify that, my expectation probably was a bit high, but the facilities are not bad, and I would compare that to a 3 star property (my personal opinion)  They have a good restaurant and the daily breakfast was good.   If you are driving yourself, please avoid this place!

shimla,"Before anything else, let's jump to pros and cons of the hotel..-  Pros:  1.Very close to the ridge/Chris church (5 mins steep walk), Jakhu mandir (30-45mins steep walk) 2.Excellent view from the rooms.(I stayed in room 201. There are couple of bad reviews of this hotel in tripadvisor but I think if one can ask or get rooms 201/301/401 then it would be really good.) 3.You earn the bragging right of being neighbor to CM's house (present CM's residence Holly Lodge is 5 mins steep walk from the hotel) 4.Courteous staff , good breakfast.  Cons:  1. Direct booking of this hotel is costlier but if you go through goibibo deals then you might land with good deals. In my case, direct booking costs 4K, however goibibo gave deals of 2.4K with complementary breakfast. 2.Being close to Jakhu",Ramesh Y,/Profile/94rameshy,"New Delhi, India",50

As our car enter the car park of the hotel the bell boy ushered us till the reception and we were welcomed by Mr. Sushil the GM of the hotel. This warm welcome with a hot cup of tea & scarf made us feel at home. Gradually we climbed up to the hotel room 303. We became more happy to gaze upon the far hills and the Mall right below the hotel. The walking distance to the mall was the major attraction to be in this hotel.
