shimla,Lovely hotel. I stayed here with my cousins. We had a super trip. The hotel has a beautiful view. We can see mountains and Shimla city. This place is very close to all the shopping street the Mall Road. We had all our meals here in hotel itself. Our breakfasts were booked at eighteen71 which offered a nice sumptuous buffet . The hotel has a beautiful cafe and a bar too where we spent most of our time. Super fun vibe. Mostly youngsters and music. Loved the food here. We had a great time here. The hotel has a parkour and spa too where we were offered a discount. We used spa services too. Took foot massages after long Mall Road walks and we loved the treatment.

shimla, Great hospitality and the team was always ready to assist with places we could see around Shimla. Parking and reaching the hotel was no issue either - we received prompt messages from the hotel team. Check in and check out were smooth and fast. We had the in room dining and all dishes tasted wonderful. The best part was round the clock service.

shimla,"As with a later review, do take the tourist lift upto the shopping mall that leads to the hotel.  Arrive unflistered, not exhausted unless you are a weight lifter!!! This hotel is the best in Shimla, views are stunning over the town (sticker on door reminds you not to leave it open to prevent mosquitos and monkeys!) and all the major must see places are within easy reach. We ate in the restaurant for all meals on 2 days as we were so impressed by the food and the service. The choice of dishes was amazing, the beer was well priced and the attentive waiters made us feel so welcome. Our guide was really a mountain goat - the hike upto Jakoo temple proved this - but the temple and the views were stunning. So many fantastic places to visit, things to see and a very happy evening",556denysew,/Profile/556denysew,,50
shimla,Hotel is situated up a hill and there is no road access to it. However there are public lifts that take you up and a three minute walk reaches the hotel. I think this is the best hotel location in Shimla. We received a warm welcome drink and as soon as our cases appeared they were taken to our room. Our room was very large with beautiful view over Shimla. The room and bathroom was dated. The bathroom had plenty  of hot water however the bath was stained and marked and the sink had no plug. When we requested one they did not seem to think it was a problem not to have one. The toilet flush was almost too stiff to press.  The bar and restaurant staff were courteous. They struggled to cope when it got busy but to be fair they managed to call in reinforcements. The menu was varied,Su B,/Profile/300sub,"Hertfordshire, United Kingdom",30

Misleading information about ‚Äúprivate lift, as it goes only to a certain level. To get to the road you will have to go down an inclined and long stone stair, with uneven steps, which makes the descent dangerous.

But since the hotel charges for a 5 star service, I would criticise on all the expectations which i didn't see.  Everything is costly. Price is quite near to a 5 star hotel but its just a 3 star hotel. And the main reason is the overrated 2 affiliated restaurants that is cafe Simla times and 1871.   Goods:  1. Management tried to reach me via every channel i.e. mail, sms, call to ensure that they received my booking. All that was not required but it felt good. 2. Location of hotel is too good. 3.

The hotel is quite well located, at one end of Mall Road and within 100 metres or so of the main Tourist lift.  We chose a 'Super Deluxe' room for the small balcony, and we did like this - the view is great morning or night, all the way across and down the village and across the valley towards the south-western hills.  The room was also quite a good size.  But this hotel has an inflated sense of its own quality and a high price to go with it.  In fact, it is a perfectly reasonable 3-star hotel.

We stayed at the valley view rooms which provide a nice view of Shimla City and the ridge from the balcony.  The adjacent cafe - Cafe Shimla Times also provides nice finger food.  The breakfast is absolutely delicious.  However the rooms are a bit small and the fittings and finish are not of highest quality considering the price you pay. The bathroom is also cramped and you have to stand on a non functional bathtub to get a shower which I thought is very risky for elder people.

shimla,We arrived at the hotel just after 10pm and a 10 hour drive to a very cold reception. The receptionist Kuldeep failed to advise the restaurant closed at 10.30 so it was when we thought we could have a quick bite that this episode turned into a comedy sketch. The kitchen and bar were closed so they advised us we could order room service. More of a ploy to get us out of the restaurant probably. So we try to order room service and guess what..... yes the kitchen and bar were still closed. To be fair poor Kuldeep was eventually persuaded to order a take out for us and they did change our room so we could enjoy the views over Shimla instead of a wall. Staff could benefit from simple welcome host training and/or laxatives to ease the constipation. Smiling might be easier!,Happy2gallivant,/Profile/Happy2gallivant,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",10
shimla,"We stayed two nights at this nice hotel with its convenient location on the Mall.  Our room was very comfortable with a king bed. The bathroom could have been better if the shower had worked properly. I think there was a problem with the water pressure as it was very low and then suddenly very high which resulted in water all over the floor. Also I think there's a problem with the generator or boiler system as there's a lot of noise coming from somewhere? We changed rooms twice but it was the same everywhere. If you wore earplugs it was ok. Apart from that it was clean, the staff were very pleasant and the food in the cosy restaurant was exceptionally good.

Their mall road facing room was small and claustrophobic. It's just 1.5 kms away from railway station/bus stand and guess free pick up/drop should not be a problem considering the price they charge for rooms.

That isn't a big deal, but you lose a bit of figurative warmth that way. Also in terms of regular warmth, they shut the heat off early in the morning.

shimla,"Shimla is not a cheap town to stay in, so the Willow Banks was the most expensive hotel of our India tour.  However, I would definitely recommend it as a place to stay in Shimla. Go for a mini-splurge.  The main reason is location. You are in the pedestrian zone here, so all is quiet. You can also easily walk up to the Ridge.  How different our stay in Shimla would have been if we had been at one of the further out hotels requiring a taxi every time we wanted to go somewhere. So the location is worth the price premium you pay.  Our first room, on the lower level, was as cold as a meat locker. The meagre electric heater could not keep up and the central heating that works at nightime didn't seem to function, so we requested a change of room.

The hotel was also jam packed and hence I attribute some of our service experiences to excess rush.  Location - As mentioned by reviewers before, the location is hotel's biggest plus. Bang on mall road though on the quieter side makes it a plus. Key shopping and eating areas are a short walk away. It is very close to the mall road lift which is again useful.   Getting there - One has to leave their cars at the lift station and get their luggage to the hotel using porters. While we had informed the hotel about our arrival the porter did not reach us.

The bar was well equipped but not well frequented by guests. The games room and the spa is nothing to really write home about.

Food served which we ordered from room service was pathetic and mediocre but heavily priced. The tomato soup was stinking. 3. Overall prices are quite high both rooms and food.

We looked at another 'deluxe' room which was identical before we stayed in the 'premier' room and that title is misleading.

Its a pretty modern hotel built next to an old structure called Willow Banks Bakery , which is now closed down. However, as a hotel it is pretty good. First advantage is the location, which is at the quieter end of the mall road, but not too far off to make it cumbersome to go for walks twice a day. Since there's pretty much noting else to do in Shimla, except enjoy the walks on mall road, this becomes an important advantage for the hotel. We had a Superior room, on the 5th floor. The ceiling is a bit odd in one corner and you'll have to watch out your head. But not a major issue.

Hotel willow banks...Its a great place to stay in...in comparison with most of the oder hotels in shimla.This was the first time we were actully staying here aftr r previous trip wer we were booked at cecil. Willow banks is like totally on the mall...and offers a lot of convenience to the guests due to such a prime location..we had a gr8 time in shimla and would be able to make atleast 3 to 5 visits to the mall in a day.In delhi we generally dont get time to sit back and relax bt i was fortunate enuf to get this luxury in the hills..!!a good long walk in the hills and then a divine,siftiahuja,/Profile/siftiahuja,india,50
shimla,"This place is quite satisfying. We had the top room type, which is not much more expensive than a standard room, but is bright, spacious and has got a great view over Shimla. I would not recommend the lower two floors, they seemed rather dark and cold. For India, this is truly a good hotel and it's not expensive at all by Western standards. The restaurant is good and trustworthy. Room service is very fast and helpful.  As in most hotels in Shimla, this one too is very popular with Indian families with children. If you have a family next to your room, it will get noisy. When we stayed a few hours in the hotel one afternoon we got mad about the music which is being played incessantly on every floor and only stops at 11pm.   Great view and close to the city centre.",ourmaninberlin,/Profile/ourmaninberlin,Berlin,40
shimla,"We stayed for our Honeymoon at this Hotel in Shimla and we found it superb.  According to the hotel folks, each hotel room is unique in that it opens to a different view and its quite true. Our room was well done with a large bed and cozy sofa.   The room service and the breakfast was nice and prompt and the hotel offers a variety of cuisines along with spa and a pub for those interested. The location is an added bonus. Its on the mall road in Shimla and close to the market.  The staff were very welcoming as well. Its a premium hotel with prices ranging upto 100$ per-night during peak season but if some one wants a real good service and excellent ambience then this is a place.",Parameshwaran G,/Profile/parameshwarang,"Mumbai, India",50

shimla,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for a few nights in July 2006.  I have no complaints about the hotel, maybe I was just glad to see it after an extremely long train ride from Delhi, but it felt like I was staying in a top European hotel.  The room was massive - one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in!  It had a fantastic balcony that had the sun on during the day.  The view from the balcony was beautiful as well - over looking all the buildings crammed into the steep mountainside.  Room was kept very clean by the cleaners as well.  The food in the restaurant was first class - serving a mixture of Indian, Chinese and Western foods.  We mainly ate Indian although did have some Chinese food too.  If I was going back to Shimla I would stay her again.  If this hotel was",kajmak,/Profile/kajmak,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",40
shimla,"We had a very comfortable stay at Hotel Willow Banks. The rooms were well kept, neat and clean. Toilets were also well maintained. The room size varied, but, on the whole, the size was adequate. The view from those rooms that had a balcony was amazing. I suggest you to book for rooms with balcony and that too on the 2nd, 3rd or 4th floor.  The hotel is located on the Mall road and so all the shops were at walking distance.  Food was not great, it was just manageable. Bar was not too good either. However, there are many hotels & restaurants on the Mall road, so food and drinks should not be a problem.

shimla,"We walked into this hotel after having a poor experience at the Baljees Regency hotel in Shimla. The hotel looks clean and welcoming on the outside and this is a good reflection of the inside too. We asked to be shown several rooms and this was organised without a moment's fuss. The rooms are clean & spacious with good amenities (mini-fridge, balconies, central heating/air conditioning, room service). We had rooms 104 & 105. The property is located on The Mall, which means cars cannot drive to it. Luggage has to be carried up from the parking area about 5/10 minutes walk away. Porters are needed to carry the luggage as it is a steep climb up to The Mall.  There are two restaurants in the hotel - one is full service near to reception, the other is outside and serves ""fast food""",Amarjit D,/Profile/happy_traveller,"Iver, United Kingdom",40
