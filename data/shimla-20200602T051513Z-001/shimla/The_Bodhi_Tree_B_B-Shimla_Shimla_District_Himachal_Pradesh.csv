Apart from those who strictly look for a Bed n Breakfast stay, everyone else should steer clear of this place.

shimla,"When I booked this place, i wasn't expecting much out of the place apart from a room with a normal bed considering a place like Shimla won't really have top notch BnB's. However, when i checked in to Bodhi Tree, I was overwhelmed with the way it was built up to perfection. Fully equipped with a little restaurant where breakfast was laid out every morning and in addition had provisions to cook food for yourself if you decided no to eat at the restaurant. The staff is courteous and well trained, polite and very helpful whenever you would require something. The view from my room was just a cherry on top of a cake. It opened up to a valley which i am sure will be magnificent during winters after it snows. Comfortable rooms and top quality beds, it was as if this isn't a BnB and I",Varadj,/Profile/Varadj,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",50
