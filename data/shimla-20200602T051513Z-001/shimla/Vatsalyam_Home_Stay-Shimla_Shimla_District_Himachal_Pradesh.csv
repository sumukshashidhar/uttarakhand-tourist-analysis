shimla,"Just returned from our tour of India and kicked it off by staying at the Vatsalyam Homestay in Shimla. As we were arriving late afternoon via the Toy Train, we E-mailed Asheesh if he could arrange a taxi to meet us at the station. Ashok the driver was waiting and whisked us of to Vatsalyam. When we arrived, we were met by Asheesh and immediately treated like members of the family. We were shown to our room, a large, clean modern, comfortable room with ensuite modern bathroom. After unpacking we had dinner and chatted with Asheesh and his wife Susinder before retiring early after a long day. However, the best was yet to come, as in the morning, we opened the curtains and there it was, a large veranda and the view overlooking the wooded valley towards Shimla and the mountains to",India Joe,/Profile/Packyourpassport,,50

shimla,Vatsalya is an excellent homestay. It is very well maintained and has all the modern facilities and amenities required for a comfortable stay away from home. We had a memorable experience staying with the Sharda family. The discussions with all the members of the family were enriching. We were traveling with our kids and the family went out of their ways to take care of our needs. It was the first time we opted for a homestay and I must say that it was a great experience.,Abhishek J,/Profile/AbhishekJ56,,50

We had only just returned from the Ladakh area a couple of days before and sadly all three of us were harbouring chest infections which worsened during our stay at Shimla.  We were able to take advantage however of itineraries given to us by the home-stay given we were only going to have one full day in the town. We decided on a trip on the ""Toy train"" to Tala Devi and getting off there to visit the Hindu temple dedicated to Tala Devi.

And boy were the reviews right! To begin with the house was situated on the slope of a hill which ensured a stupendous view to the rest of Shimla from its balconies. The house itself was beautifully constructed and one couldn't say the difference between the room there and one at a 5 star, much. The distinguishing factor and the most important one was the sense of home. The Shardha family is a really loving one. They hosted us like we were their own family. Mr.Asheesh gave us perfect guidelines to go around Shimla which was very helpful. If you are looking for a stay in Shimla with family then this is",Prasanna Venkat...

shimla,We stayed three nights. All the warm reviews are justified. From arranging for us to be met at Shimla station to helping us through India's currency problems Ashish was great. Room and terrace were great. We had two evening meals which were fab. Best of all though was the welcome and interest shown by the whole family and especially Ashish's father with whom we shared plenty of good conversations at mealtimes. We had thought it might be inconvenient being a short distance outside the town but the family clearly have excellent arrangements with local drivers and the one we had was efficient and inexpensive. Oh and Shimla well worth the time to get there.....,Jon L,/Profile/jonl367,"Malvern, United Kingdom",50
shimla,"We stayed for 3 nights and we loved it! The rooms are great and feature everything you may wisch for your stay, but more important: the family welcomed us very warmly and was super helpful in everything - recommendations on what to do, organising cabs (the homestay is a bit far out, but good to reach by car and definetly more than worth the little extra effort plus the view from the balcony is amazing) and really cared for all of us, especially for the one of us who didn't feel well. We enjoyed the delicious food and their great company during dinner so much. It has been by far the best place we stayed!

I have to say that the Sharda family is one awesome kind of people – extremely warm, extending such great hospitality.  The rooms are neat, clean, comfortable and the views from the rooms are spell-bounding.   Food was delicious and finger-licking good.  It is a pity as we just had a one night stay due to time constraints.  It was no necessity for me to write this review,  as there are so many others who have written about the goodness of this place, but I am still writing as I would like to give my own thumbs-up for Vatsalyam.  Uncleji, Auntyji, Asheesh and Ranjana – you are beautiful hosts and all I can say is God Bless You!

shimla,"This was easily among our best homestay experiences anywhere in the world. Huge positives for this property include the location, the view and the hospitality of the Sharda Family. We would gladly recommend this property.  It is located at a 15 minute drive from the city centre and has a lovely view of 5 out of the 7 hills of Shimla afar and a lush forest close by.   The hosts were wonderful... hospitable gracious and accommodative of the odd requests. We were very impressed to see the goodwill they enjoyed at all the places of interest nearby; especially a serene hilltop temple (Padhai).

Ashish had graciously arranged for our pick up from the train station   While the exterior is a typical Shimla home overlooking the slopes the interiors are very well appointed with a nice balcony, dining room and well stocked library.  The food was homely, wholesome and delicious and Aunty and Ranjana wowed us with their hospitality.

The home cooked food was delicious. Mr Ashish and his entire family were gracious hosts who made us feel welcome and took every effort to make us feel comfortable.
