Many treetop obstacle courses, rock climbing, rappelling, zip-line, etc.. There are Exciting treks that meander through some amazing Fauna and Pleura. There is a beautiful waterfall nearby. A well-run place, courteous and helpful staff. The chef is excellent and serves various cuisines. 15 feet below, there is crystal clear rivulet called ‘Shiva’.

I had booked a taxi and the driver was standing right there before our bus arrived. He was quite courteous by nature and once he dropped us to the camp, he made sure that until we had not entered the camp, he shouldn't leave as we were just two girls.

To start off ...we were a little skeptical when we reached there beacuse of a landslide which had blocked the narrow path towards it. But once we had taken the walk down the hill we knew it was all worth it!!!! The place is beautiful and words wouldnt be enough (this is the first time i m ever reviewing any place).  The tents were clean and well maintained, the scenic beauty was breath taking and the food ( lets not talk about it, it makes me hungry) was yum.

We have 8 year old kid and our friend's too have 4 years old. We were in our car and other two couples with kid were in other's car. I usually have terrible nausea but this time almost everything was ok except that 4 km kachha rasta which leads us to the camp. Driving on that road is not easy because a small mistake can be dangerous. Still we reached there. The place was totally cut from city's life.

shimla,"When i was planning a short trip to Shimla and around, a friend suggested to explore Hail Himalayas too, and I'm glad that i did.   I was looking for a nice place close to nature, away from the hustle bustle of the city, hence was not keen to book a stay at Shimla, and after a lot of deliberations (as i was travelling with an infant too) I finally booked this camp resort. I must admit that the entire experience at this place was awesome, from the quality of tents, cleanliness, food, staff, nature, activities,etc. ...except the approach from Sadhupul and the unwanted trek from parking lot to the camp resort, which we city people are not used to, however the staff the was extremely helpful to make that too easy for us. We stayed for 3N 4D and entire time spent there was all worth",MonikaG17,/Profile/MonikaG17,"Gurgaon, Haryana, India",40
