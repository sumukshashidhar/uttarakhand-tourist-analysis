shimla,"I stayed at Kapil hotel from Dec 25-27 with my family . I booked this hotel seeing the nice reviews in Tripadvisor and my expctation was fully met . The rooms were really big , Clean and comfortable. The front desk is very efficient and always ready to help with a smile . I got a lot of help in making my subsequent travel plan and cab booking . I missed the Toytrain and called them for a cab after I got down at Chandigarh station and they promptly arranged one with reasonable rate.  The location of the hotel is also good . There is a foot bridge that will take you to lakkar bazar in 10 min and from there Shimla Mall is 5 min walk The food we ordered were delivered very fast and the taste was very good",Prasit,/Profile/PrasitRay,,50

shimla,"It was nice & beautiful stay at Hotel Kapil, we had a Valley view room.  complimentary welcome honey lemon tea was awesome.

shimla,"I visited Shimla on a busy long weekend and it was difficult to find good hotels online due to rush. On TripAdvisor I stumbled across this hotel and was impressed by the reviews and decided to take a chance as usually I like and trust only the proven and big names. I reached early in the morning at 8:00 AM but the hotel staff was very helpful and courteous to let me have an early check in and they even offered welcome drink (I chose green tea) and snacks. The room I had booked was with valley view and a deluxe Suite . As soon as we entered the room, it felt cozy even in the cold morning of Shimla. Nice, spacious, clean and beautifully designed with wooden flooring and good interior designing.

Compared to all the other hotels we have stayed in during this trip to India, Hotel Kapil seemed very expensive for what it was, however I think this is probably true for all hotels in Shimla as it is such a popular destination.  It was 10 minutes walk to the ridge and mall road, and we walked to the Himachal State Museum, Annandale and the Jakhoo Temple on separate days with no problems.

All services offered are pretty much the standard services expected at such hotels. The front desk staff at the hotel and the back end reservation staff are pretty rude. The standard level room is dubbed as premium rooms.  The tour combinations offered are pretty much useless and inflexible. Four out of five places listed in each combination of are useless.

It's a 10 minute walk to the top of the ridge and the Mall with great views of the hills as you get there. The staff at the hotel were really friendly and were happy to help with anything we needed. The food is great, good portions sizes and a large menu, the slight downside is that it is only room service. If you get a room with a desk or table in then this isn't an issue, but it was a bit of a squeeze for us with only a coffee table. We would certainly stay here again.

The staff at the hotel couldn't of been more accommodating and friendly.  We didn't eat there at all but there is an extensive menu and food is brought to your room.  The Wi Fi is a bit strange in that you get a code, this gives you access to up to three gadgets but only 1gb so when it runs out you have to get another code, not good with a teenager!

No restaurant so have to order room service for breakfast and other meals if you want. Room service is reasonable, ok but not the same as having a breakfast buffet. We upgraded to the Penthouse suite on the top floor for an extra charge per night. The suite was absolutely freezing and damp bed sheets. I think it hadn't been used for a while. Asked for a heater, which they then charged for on a daily rate which was unreasonable and objected to but the manager would not listen. Heating should be included. In fact the suite needed 2 heaters to heat the rooms properly. It was too cold to enjoy our stay there and we were glad to move onto the next hotel.",J B,,"Takayama, Japan",30

Staff is very courteous and very eager to help. Provide complimentary cab services to and fro Main Mall.

They also provided good advice about sight seeing around Shimla.  The only down side was the food prices which we found to be expensive.

There's a cab pick-up and drop for the 500 metre distance to Lakkar Bazaar b/w 9 am to 7 pm, so for those who don't like climbing - that's another problem sorted. It's also located on a quietish street, so my assumption is parking shouldn't be much of a concern either.  Now the hotel in itself is small and comfy, nothing lavish.

The room service done by Satpal is mindblowing. He doesnt even wait for tip and is very swift is getting the orders done. There is 24 hrs hot water available. This hotel is located near shopping  points. Hotel provides a nano as a pick and drop to Lakkar Bazar which is half a mile from the hotel. Non veg lovers should definitely try Chicken Tandoori. They make it very soft. The breakfast items and parathas are very delicious.

shimla,"Firstly, Simla is no more the great tourist spot that it used to be. So the disappointment of Simla should not be reflected on the hotel's review. It is located bit far from the Ridge, but they do provide a complimentary drop-off service. It is a small property, where they don't have a restaurant. But food is delivered in room on demand. We took the top-floor penthouse. Well, it doesn't appear as a penthouse per se, but this is a more spacious room of the hotel. The private balcony is a added charm, as you can spend idyllic hours sitting there. They do provide arrangements for local tours, but at times the drivers can be bit pushy. They will insist on going to a different attraction than what you have in your mind.",Kinshuk N,/Profile/kinshukn,,40

A small balcony in the valley facing rooms would have much better.  Only in room dining is available, but service is prompt.

shimla,Kapil is a good budget hotel and the service quality is very good.   Pros  - Clean and tidy rooms  - Lots of in-room amenities for a budget hotel  - Excellent service - Complimentary drop to Lakkar Bazar  - Nice welcome drink and biscuilts  Cons  - Small rooms  - Expensive inroom dining and taxi facilities - Deluxe room but NO valley facing view. I asked them to accomodate us in the next 5 days that we would stay but the management could not help. I wondered why they could not even provide 1 room which would have checked out for the next 5 days.  - Rooms are not sound proof. So you see external voices coming in and vice-versa. This is more because of a bungalow like building converted into a hotel.  - Their place is a bit far from Lakkar bazaar and the road has dim lights in,Mihir D,/Profile/604mihird,"Mumbai, India",30

Not only they serve food hot, they also ensure that it remains hot. I remember their staff checking in on our food and offering to reheat themselves even after their serving hours i.e 10 PM.

The penthouse suite was ideal with great views outside, a nice balcony and a small seating area around the TV where you can order snacks and drinks to sit and relax.  The service from the staff was second to none, happy to accommodate any needs, the only issue being they closed at around 10pm at night. We also organised a car to take us around for two days to areas we could trek far away and bring us back at reasonable rates.   The hotel offers a free drop off to near the bazaar until 7pm but it's an easy enough walk back after this time.   All in all couldn't have asked for more.

shimla,"I traveled to Simla on 24th of December, 2012 for christmas vacations. I stayed in Hotel Kapil for one night. There are a few pros and cons of the hotel but I would say the pros outnumber the cons very easily.  Pros:  1. The rooms are very neat, clean and tidy. 2. The bathrooms are execptionally clean which  comes as a surprise in Simla where most of the hotels are old and have average bathroom fittings. 3. The food in the hotel is to die for and very reasonable. We tried Biryani, pancakes, noodles, chai, scrambled eggs, toasts and everything was delicious and fresh. 4. The views from the rooms are magical. Our room had a direct view to Radisson Hotel and the hills. And good curtain work on the windows. 5.

shimla,"I & another family stayed at this hotel in May 2012 for 2 days. We had a family suite & other room. Both were very neat & clean. Both rooms had a nice view of valley. Staff is co-operative & very well mannered. Though hotel has no restaurant, they could arrange a very good meal whenever ordered. Mall road is far from this hotel. All in all a very pleasant & comfortable stay. Would certainly recommend this highly.",ksaPune,/Profile/ksaPune,pune,40

shimla,"My wife and I went to Shimla for one night and looking for a decent hotel to stay since it was late when we arrived in Shimla.  We didn't want anything pricy (only to sleep) but a clean and comfortable place to rest.  Our driver took us to this place.  We were skeptical (my wife especially) at first and we asked to view the room we were going to get for the night before we booked.  Room looked great, especially for the price.  Staff was very courtious, polite and friendly.  View of Shimla valley was great from the room.  We didn't have full meals from the hotel but, chai and some toast.  Dishes were clean and room service was prompt.  All in all it was a great choice.  I will definitely stay at Kapil Hotel again....when I go back to Shimla.",rupindervirk,/Profile/rupindervirk,"Fresno, California, USA",50
shimla,"This hotel is really awesome for staying and enjoying the perfect view of Shimla. I think this could be the best Hotel near Mall road. We had taken the pent house in the hotel and it was a perfect choice with very beautiful rooms and a terrace where we enjoyed morning tea a lot. The food is of great taste. Once you try the food or breakfast you will always prefer to have your meal at the hotel only with very decent price. The hotel staff are really nice and special thanks to Mr. Kunal for guiding us for seight seeing and providing pick up and drop to Railway staion with Taxi. Special thanks to Ramesh, the Taxi Man, a very nice person to meet. I have decided whenever there is a second visit to Shila may be during winters, this Hotel is my first choice to stay.

shimla,"I came to know about kapil hotel through tripadvisor.. I checked their website and was little bit skeptical if the reviews/pics are latest & correct. I am really glad to write this review that the stay at kapil hotel was awesome. After clearing my doubts and queries I made the reservations for the penthouse...  The penthouse had a private terrace with a fantastic view of the whole shimla valley. The room was spacious, warm with comfortable bed & pillows well made with 2 clean extra quilts. The bathroom was very clean with an encloser for the shower, hot running water through out.  I stayed with my family for 2 nights and I had a great time. At night the view was spectacular with pin drop silence everywhere. We had a great comfortable peaceful sleep. The shimla mall road is just",Ankur S,/Profile/992ankurs,"Mumbai, India",50

The Hotel room is really good and it looks same as thier website says. Hotel Staff is cordial and helpful. Food is good.  We enjoyed our stay and the view. I will recommend to my friends this is worth for your money.

shimla,We found this place based on reviews on trip advisor and we weren't disappointed. We stayed in the family room for 2 nights and enjoyed it very much.  It is within walking distance of the main mall. Shopping and restaurants are all located along the mall.  Our hotel room was clean and a decent size. The staff were very accommodating when we asked for extra sheets and towels. The beds and pillows were comfortable.  The shower is the first one we have had in India that is enclosed so that the whole bathroom floor doesn't get wet when you use it. Fantastic.   Our room had a beautiful view over the whole valley.  The staff were very friendly and helpful. When I checked out I had forgotten to mention that we hadn't received something from our room service order.

shimla,"We struggled to find somewhere in advance from either the lonely planet or from tripadvisor that was affordable. Hotel kapil is excellent in so many ways: location, beautiful views from the rooms, good breakfasts with room service available. Best of all it was excellent value for money. The only drawback was the level of knowledge of staff (for example, they said we could ski when in fact we couldn't).
