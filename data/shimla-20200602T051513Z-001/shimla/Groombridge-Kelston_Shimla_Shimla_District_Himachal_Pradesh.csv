shimla,"Groombridge truly became a second home for me during my 5 days there.  Vijay,Sheetal,Meet and everyone are wonderful and do the utmost to ensure you have all you need.  The food was lovely and the rooms are utterly delightful.  I had a taxi with me and went into Shimla every day. I am sure Groombridge would arrange a taxi if you needed one.  As it was February,  I used a heater and was fine. I appreciate the peace, away from Shimla itself.  ",Excursion55215198172,/Profile/Excursion55215198172,"London, United Kingdom",50
shimla,"Groombridge is a beautifully done up, boutique property where service with smile is the hallmark. Cheerful environment with vibrant interiors, it has a quaint hill charm. Vijay Suri, the owner, is warm and charming, as is his hospitality. The entire team is so hospitable and leave no stone unturned to make one feel comfortable. We wanted to visit the Mall road and promptly enough, a car with driver was made available to drop us there. Our room was clean and cozy, the mattress was extraordinarily comfortable and the bathroom had hot, running water.  We visited the property in December and Vijay specially organized a bonfire and barbecue for a wonderful winter experience.

shimla,"Clearly this review is not in line with all the others.  Firstly let me say it is written by a retired Brit so my perspective is somewhat different for what appears to be all other reviews which seem to be Indian nationals.  We chose this accommodation based on the excellent reviews, which with hindsight was a mistake.  On arrival we found that the location was at least 30+ mins walk from the mall along difficult roads and the room/hotel had no heating.  Although we were provided with extra duvets and a small heater with a night time temperature of just above zero it made for a freezing night.  In fact too cold for a shower in the morning.  We cut short our stay and moved to another hotel on the Mall which had heating.  This was a smart move and ensured we enjoyed our stay in",Paul R,/Profile/paulr685,"Royston, United Kingdom",20
