shimla,"This hotel is situated at the start point of Mall road. Taxi will drop till Hotel Marina, from here on the journey is afoot. It's a 6 min walk but the walk is very steep upwards which is not ideal with two suitcases.  The rooms are very good and staff, especially in the restaurant, were excellent and made to feel welcome in hotel. Reception were able to organise us a couple of trips which were good and arranged a taxi for return to Delhi.  Food was excellent and would recommend taking the half board option. The major negative of the hotel was the cold in both bedroom and in restaurant. We were in Shimla in early March but without exception every guest ate with their coats on whether at breakfast or for evening meal. Heaters are provided in bedroom but they are too small to make",Philip O,/Profile/PhilipO845,"Gateshead, United Kingdom",30

shimla,"Decided to book this property after an amazing experience in Honeymoon Inn , Manali and it was a right decision. The hotel is located at a walking distance from Mall Road and the view of the valley was also good from the hotel.  If you are planning to visit Shimla an book this property then I would strongly recommend to not use Google Maps in that area as there are many Sealed Roads with heavy fine for defaulters that is not shown in the map. It's better to ask locals for direction and the nearest and famous point is Marina point that you should ask for.   The staff there is very friendly and supportive so you can also give them a call and they will do the best to help you get there.

shimla,"Now it is the right time to recapitulate one of our most delightful and amazing trip with family at Shimla. We have stayed at Honeymoon Inn for 4 days which we have chosen after a detailed review of Hotels at Shimla. As we have heard always that Shimla is now very crowded and not peaceful for vacation, though we are neither very tranquil nor noisy in nature, these efforts were given just to find a place that can match with us. Thanks to all associates of Honeymoon Inn to offer us that just we needed to. The hotel is situated on mall road but a little efforts to walk for 3-4 minutes slight upwards makes it a peaceful den to find or confined in beauty of nature.

shimla,"We stayed here for three nights in late October in a group of 14 adults. We arrived with little light to spare but enjoyed the most spectacular sunset on the hotel’s terrace. The supper served by the staff was delicious. They coped admirably with a large number of people. The rooms were clean, comfortable and we all had a view. Reception staff members were professional and gave excellent advice. Kitchen and waiting staff deserve recognition as do the porters who carried at least two large cases in their backs to our awaiting taxis in readiness for the next leg of our journey. I would definitely come here again with my husband who was unable to make this trip. We could even have a “second honeymoon” to celebrate 34 years!

Ample of activities to do in the hotel to keep you engaged. Staff is co-operative and food is just awesome. I would recommend to go for buffet meals while you book as it is value for money compared to ala carte.  Some minor things which I disliked was the room interiors. It could have been better.

I had booked honeymoon special room but they allotted lower grade room saying they had booking for it. The manager was extremely rude and shamelessly saying they don't have room - take it or leave it even when their corporate sales office confirmed that the room booked was in deed Honeymoon special.

Thankfully, Honeymoon Inn proved to be an exception with excellent rooms, friendly staff and good location that was away from the crowd, yet not too far from the mall road.   Honeymoon Inn was a last minute choice based on recommendation of my friend. The hotel is located close to the mall road but in a Govt. owned area, that restricts vehicular traffic.

As it snowed on the day we visited we had to walk 30-45 mins as vehicles weren’t going there. But the view on next day due to snow fall was awesome and hotel looked amazing. Amenities were there but could not use them due to time constraints. The bathroom had water logging issues.

You have to scale a driveway , take an elevator to 4th floor and then walk through a balcony to reach the reception. So I don't think this is ideal for families with old people.  Decor was retro , rooms are beautiful and comfortable. Staff are very polite and willing to oblige to our needs . Food is excellent.

However by the next morning we found that everything, bed, cloths, towels, walls and floor were damp! This probably has something to do with the room not having any ventilation. They did move us to another room when we asked too.   Access to the hotel is poor. Firstly you can't get a taxi anywhere near the hotel, so it's a walk from the drop off point. Signage to the hotel was nonexistent. Then it's s trek up the track to the hotel grounds, followed by a lift ride up to the reception. Hard work!

shimla,"Me and my friend were staying in this hotel only for 1 night but we fell in love with this romantic place, the view is amazing,  you can see forest and foggy mountains from the room, it's made in British style: fireplace and book shelves, it's so peaceful and you can enjoy reading books or looking at beautiful flowers on the terrace, staff is very friendly and cooperative, wifi is in the room,  and the food was amazing,  we ordered dum aloo and it was soooo delicious, breakfast is very nice, )view from the restaurant is great, I like that hotel is small and not crowded, you feel there like you are at home. The rooms are clean. We really enjoyed.",Anastasia R,/Profile/582anastasiar,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",50
shimla,"This a great hotel just half km from the mall. The rooms are dated but well kept, clean and cool. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The food is excellent.  It has fantastic views of the valley and you feel like you are amongst the trees.  The downside; from street level to reception count on the equivalent of 10 flights of stairs. Could be challenging  for those from sea level because of the thin air of 2500 meters.",Keralita10,/Profile/Keralita10,Portland,40
shimla,The hotel is beautifully loacated on top of Shimla. It gives a breathtaking view. Food is good too. Cons: Service bit poor. They dont give you mineral water complimentary but give you filter water... I had never ever experienced this in any hotel. Every hotel gives atleast 2 bottle complimentary for a day. Even coffee satches are given limited. No parking available. One has to walk a lot to get to the hotel and that too the reception is at 4th floor. But because of it this has the view. So anyone who cannot walk should avoid this but young crowd should think of this hotel. This is bit far from mall road like 10 mins walking distance. ,Rakhi M,/Profile/357rakhim,"Navi Mumbai, India",40

shimla,"A nice place to relax, unwind. It is situated on Mall road but away from the crowd.  Food is really nice, service is good.  There are few points to mention for fellow travelers -  1. No balcony in rooms, although windows are there. 2. Hotel is not new, so washrooms are not great(Not bad as well) 3. Name is Honeymoon Inn - so good sized bath tubs are there in washrooms. 4. It is away from the mall road lift, although they provide coolie but we felt exhausted at reaching the hotel. 5. If you have self driven vehicle, they don't have parking space, you need to park in chargeable parking spaces(Govt and Private) around the main road below.  Tip: If you reach shimla early morning, the roads are not closed so the car can be driven up to the hotel lift.",Badal,/Profile/BadalVishal,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
shimla,"The catching point about the hotel is its location, nestled in lap of nature! Hotel is fairly modern with all needed amenities in place.  The buffect breakfast was good and had a little less options in south indian food, rest assured it had some hotdogs and sandwiches. We stayed in deluxe room and had good sleep quality and clean toilets.   Service to room was also fantastic and crew at the reception were helpful too. We stayed there for a night and was with friends and family. I think it surely derserves the rating that presently it holds. Cheers to HN property.  The hotel also has a decent spa with limited options like jacuzzi and massage chair and rates looked economic.

Surrounded by towering pine trees,  this hotel's location is excellent.  When it comes to food, it is decent, however the service isnt upto the mark.. The restaurant staff almost seem cold and unwelcoming. In a place like Shimla, where there are hundreds of hotels to choose from, the hotel must note that such pain points could cause them a dent in reputation and business!",RadhikaAcharya,/Profile/RadhikaAcharya,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",30
shimla,"Pros Hotel location is nice, lot of scenic views from rooms as well as from hotel premises. Hotel is walking distance from Mall road. So if you wish you can plan lunch outside. Hotel interior is impressive but rooms interior is OK.  Cons 1.Surprised to know there is no housekeeping support during night time. When we raised concern that single heater is not enough for entire room and electric blanket is not working night duty person told that he is helpless as there is no support staff available during night time. 2.Rooms are not sound proof. We can hear noise coming from next room. 3.Bathroom interior is average,U'll feel like staying at home. 4.Complimentary fruit plate provided is joke.  5.Single X box to be shared among all guests, funny.",sandip j,/Profile/817sandipj,,40

The rooms were decent and well appointed. The staff were extremely courteous and helpful. Altogether one will feel the warmth while staying here. It is very close to the mall road which is the main centre of activity. The only draw back is that the car will not reach the hotel and one has to climb a steep climb to reach up here and there is no parking facility available.

The Mall Road is long lane having lots and lots of shops for food, shopping and relaxing too. This street is on uphill side on Shimla. Now please note this road is restricted road and vehicle are not allowed to go. So if you are making a booking for a hotel then please do cross check how much distance you have to walk by yourself to reach hotel. Most hotelier misguide just to encourage bookings. So please do keep this point in mind. Also there is a 'HP' passing cars have privilege over other state cars.

The hotel has no parking (just like most other hotels in Shimla) and has one of the most tiring ramps to access the lift from the mall road. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this hotel for old people and people who have difficulty in walking as the ramp indeed is testing.

Our driver showed the hotel when we entered Shimla saying right there in the tallest hill, which was quiet impressive.. The climb is steep but the view is great. Suite was nice. The view from suite was like looking down at entire Shimla. The sunset stole our heart. There was a swing in the suite and heat blower was inclusive, which was indeed nice. Hot water served all the time was quiet thoughtful. Mall road is 10Mins walk downhill. Shimla was chilly but very very pretty. Bathtub was there - dint use it coz it was cold.

Located at less than a kilometer from The Mall road and surrounded by nature, Honeymoon is a great place to stay in Shimla. We stayed here for two nights and it was a very comfortable stay. The hotel construction is somewhat unconventional (but good), in the sense that to reach the hotel rooms you need to first take the lift from the entry of the hotel (which is unattended) to the reception, where you will be well greeted by the hotel management and staff.

I must say though that some my request were catered as I visited there during off peak season.  Also try not to go there in your own vehicle as parking is a big mess in Shimla as they want to maintain the serenity of the place.

I will remain a happy visitor of Honeymoon Inn. I am thankful to the hotel management and Makemytrip for the off-seasonal offer.

The bed had some special kind of mechanism to heat itself up and it was very helpful as it was too cold due to the rains. Buffet choices for breakfast and dinner were plenty and food was great.

It's very well designed and gives wonderful view of Shimla all around. 2. Food - The variety, taste and the flavor of the food on offer rivals some of the spreads in 5 star hotels. 3. Staff - Warm & friendly staff. 4. We even got a surprise gift which was a warm gesture. Even small things like an umbrella in the room were thoughtful gestures considering the unpredictable Shimla weather. 5. Of all the hotels we stayed for the honeymoon, my wife liked this the most.

Then you give a call to the Honeymoon Inn Reception and someone would come down to help you with your luggage and take you to hotel.  Then there is a steep 200 m walk-through.

Reaching the reception at 4th Floor, you get the keys to your room, and further climb stairs to 2nd floor to reach your room. Out of Breath!

The hotel staff makes sure your stay is comfortable and offer help/suggestions - be it ordering something from their menu, planning to go out for sight seeing OR arranging transportation.   The only downside is the uphill climb - you will need to stop at least twice to get back your breath.  Hotel should think about arranging something (any vehicle OR horses etc. to take guests uphill).

Reaching the hotel is a bit difficult as it requires a stiff walking up from the main road. The hotel is ideal both for honeymooners and familymen. The Deluxe room we stayed is not very big but cozy and with modern equipments like Electric Kettle. The bathroom is very good with modern gadgets. Hotel staff are very helpful.

Food in the restaurant is very good and decently priced. What you get here as a package(room+service+food+views) is real value for money.  Some things to consider: 1. Parking is not available. We have to make our own arrangements. Nearby high-court parking is usually available. 150rs per day 2. From parking, to reach the hotel is a climb and not easy for elders. For luggage, porter is available(Chargeable). 70rs 3. No Balcony in any rooms, like in most of the Shimla hotels.",upratap,/Profile/upratap,"Bengaluru, India",40

There is a steep climb to reach the hotel. The view from room was excellent. The room was spacious enough with clean bed linen and carpet. The bathroom was also spacious and clean. Staff is very good and polite. Awesome view from the restaurant area where they keep buffet breakfast and dinner. Food was tasty and widely spread with varities. Overall an excellent hotel to stay bcoz of all factors like location, views, food and an excellent staff. Hats off to the management, will visit this hotel again for sure. The only drawback was atleast they could have provided a candle light dinner of any complimentary thing for honeymoon",Vikramnotey,/Profile/Vikramnotey,"Mumbai, India",40

You don't have to worry about your luggage though, it is all done for you by some really hard working porters, nice guys. The room we had was fine,clean and comfortable.In my opinion, the view from the restaurant is quite stunning, the food was very good as well !!! The staff could not do enough for you, nothing was a problem, even down to going into town, and picking up beer for us.As long as you are reasonably fit , it is quite well placed for Simla, if you have walking difficulties, maybe not so. Would I stay there again, yes, without a doubt. A nice comfortable, friendly hotel. ",kingfisher75,/Profile/kingfisher75,united kingdom,50

shimla,Stayed 2 nights at the property in Oct 2013........  Took the MD cottage ( a duplex upscale wooden masterpiece ) where the view was OUT OF THIS WORLD  Breakfast and food was very very good and best part was the service.  The hotel is on the Mall road and is nicely tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Shimla and is an absolute MUST for honeymooners and couples.  The only detrimental fact and there is NOT MUCH that the hotel can do about it is the approach. It is terrible that too being an understatement and is a major hindrance if you are travelling with elderly people like I did....

shimla,"Stayed @ Honeymoon Inn, Shimla from 4th-6th May and the feeling was average. Food was ok, would rate it 3 out of 5. Front desk people seems confused and they don't provide any clarity when a question is asked to them. We took 2 rooms of which 1 room needed to have an extra bed. Instead of providing an extra bed they just provided an extra mattress. This is something which is not expected.  We had booked our vehicle from the hotel and the front desk persons (Mr Sanjay / Zeeshan) couldn't give a proper reply on asking why we were not taken to few places which were mentioned in our itenary.

The heater is completely useless, what more I can say. It just didn't heat. To get water we had to call 2-3 times only after that job would get done. There is little walk to reach the hotel.

If you speak the local language, this place is probably great.  As we did not, it was very difficult to communicate with the hotel staff.  For example, no one at the front desk could understand our request to have a working light in the bathroom.  We had to remove the bulb and coax someone into the room before they understood the issue.  Even then, they still didn't fix the problem (I think it was a problem with the outlet vs. the bulb), but we were too frustrated to pursue it further.

shimla,"The hotel is excellent to stay .I am really happy with the services that were provided. I stayed in this hotel for 5 days and my stay was very comfortable. Rooms were very specious, neat and clean. Location is really very good and easily accessible from the main city. Honeymooners would be happy as the rooms are comfortable. Only the lobby area needs to be improved. The lobby lacks comfortable sofas and tables.",renu2642,/Profile/renu2642,Kolkata,40

shimla,Well I required a room for my friend for his Honeymoon ....  I spoke to the Travelease people who handle the reservation's for the hotel and they asked me to send a mail for the same and transfer the amount into their bank....  I immediately transferred the amount and i attached a snap shots for the same....  but after some days when i asked for the receipt they said that my room is not confirmed and the don't have rooms available now...  The reservation staff of the hotel dont even bother to have a follow up with the guest nor they check from which person the amount has been credited ....  I would just recommend people to have a Invoice for the amount transferred before going there..  The hotel should also upgrade their pathetic and out dated system of receiving money online...,sharon786,/Profile/sharon786,mumbai,10

shimla,I was a bit hesitant when I had booked the Hotel on a recommendation from a friend. I called up the Hotel when reaching the High Court parking and the porter from the hotel came to us in approx. 10 minutes.  I was apprehensive of the long trek to the hotel with the kids but I was more of liking the same as we dont really get such fresh air in the city and the kids were enjoying too. The desk staff was really courteous and the room had a wonderful view of the valley. The hotel is situated on the far end of the mall road and a stroll from the Hotel takes you to the Ridge on the mall road. I would not recommend aged people checking in the hotel as it would be tiresome for them to reach the hotspot of Shimla ( The Ridge) The restaurant served us great snacks and the dinner was,Pavandeep,/Profile/Pavandeep,Chandigarh,40

shimla,I stayed at this hotel in June 2009 with my husband and liked this place a lot. This hotel lives up to its name and is truly a great place for honeymooners. The rooms offer a great view of the Shimla Valley and are very comfortable. The hotel has a very well maintained garden and a sitting area where one can sit and enjoy the sun. They have these concealed speakers installed around the place where light music is played throughout the day. One of the major negatives of the hotel is the approach to the main gate which is a very steep climb and has to be done on foot which is very tiring. The breakfast buffet is OK but the a la carte is great.,gktanu,/Profile/gktanu,Ghaziabad,40

Please make sure that you call the reception and ask them the nearest point to get down from the taxi. Note that the taxis are not allowed to ply on the road where the hotel is and it is a steep 5-10 minute walk from the nearest drop-off point. I took taxi from the railway station to the hotel and the taxi fellow lied to me saying that they are not allowed to go any further. From that point the hotel was about 15 minute walk over a very steep road. If you have elderly people and kids make sure you ask the hotel reception to help you.

The hotel is at a easy walking distance from the mall road - has a great view of Shimla, is clean (though there are some spots in the carpets which the management may want to look into).  The food was fantastic on the first day, but on the second day it was below average (unlucky day we presume).  The hotel has an exceptionally clean & compact lawn and a coffee break area which was really nice.  The hotel is way cheaper if you book through travelguru.

We read lot of reviews before booking this place - u have to walk around a km to reach this place from parking- hilly walk - not too difficult though  if you are used to walk around a km everyday- also you get someone to carry ur stuff to the hotel.  The staff is very helpful and food is nice.  Must try - chilly cheese toast & in breakfast - mushroom on toast!  They serve great Firni - but do remember to place your order an hour in advance if you like it cold.  The rooms are clean - small things are taken care of.

The warmth and helpful nature of the staff members were remarkable. Our Deluxe room was just excellent,I loved those oval sofas very much. It was classy and comfortable at the same time. The view is excellent,you can see half of the town and the mall road also from your window.Coffee was served,it was just like Cafe Coffee day,i can say,even better!

The walk to the hotel from the Mall road reminded me of the days of my childhood. It is well located, just 3-4 minutes walking distance from the Mall Road, & provides a beautiful scenario of Shimla from any part of the hotel.   The hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service before. The staff was well cultured, always eager to please & best of all, the food - the taste still lingers in my mouth. For so many days, it was quite difficult to fit in any meals out after all that!

It was around Rs 2700 a night, AND you have to pay extra to use the computer AND for tea AND for coffee AND im sure everything else you wanted as well. This staff was not very friendly and they dont even speak English. The front desk guy litteraly hunted me down to pay the Rs 30 for my tea in which they brought to my room making me think it was free. Btw, dont tip the bellhops. The rooms are way outdated and really tacky with mirrors on the ceiling. The only thing good out of this hotel was the location ROCKED (only a 2 minute walk to the mall) and that they opened their restaurant early for us cause we were leaving, and they only served us butter and toast.
