shimla,"Good option to stay with all basic amenities and food options if you are travelling from south side. Because you get parathas, rajma chawals only all the time plus no halal food available in resturants in shimla city. Reaching sterling will be difficult if you are travelling by public transports.   The only problem we faced during our stay is with the concealed room heater, which is just for a name sake one. It never keeps a room warm plus they switch it off every now and then. But they provided us with a portable room heater when complained which made our stay at nights warm. The views of snow from the rooms are awesome.",Nick,/Profile/Ozracer2,"Chennai, India",40
shimla,"Stayed at this property for 3 nights in March. It was snowing in Kufri. The hotel infrastructure is decent. Internal heating system worked well, though the hot water was never available on tap on demand. We had to call every time we needed it.  The bed mattress was so soft, it was almost painful to be sinking into the springs. Probably already too old and need to be changed. Occasional power outages were well handled by the property by generator supply. Food was average, but not bad. The staff was very cooperative and attentive.",tujoe,/Profile/tujoe,,40

The Chef Mr. Rooplal went a mile ahead to make ""khichdi"" for the kids and make them feel at home. Even the other staff at the restaurant, activity room was very polite. Heater was provided in the room. Overall, very good experience.  We don't know however as to why a bonfire is something that is chargeable separately or why all the guests cannot be part of this funtime unlike our experience with Sterling at Ooty a couple of years back. Also, the hot water of the geyser is not a constant and has a capacity to fill only 1 bucket of hot water in 30 mins time. I guess this is the only drawback.

shimla,"A lot of negatives to point out in general. The room service is charged with 18%GST and 10% service charge. While this is applicable for rooms with tariff above 7500, they've shown their room tariffs to be above 7500 on their website, however their invoices I signed are literally showing half of that tariff. Any hotel with tariff below 7500 are supposed to charge 5%GST. This resort being situated in the outskirts of Kufri completely ignorant of the norms are doing daylight robbery. People have got to take note and if somebody's got the time to sue them legally, have got to. I came with my family on tour and just had to bide the stay through all this atrocity. The room was fine.

It was like a steam bath (non stop continuous hot showers)   Service was excellent, food was great but one thing I miss is they do not provide accomodation for drivers",AMITJAIN250176,/Profile/AMITJAIN250176,"Indore, India",50

I must tell you that right from the cab arrangements at the airport and through to the entire duration of our stay, the entire team at Sterling Kufri including GM Prashant Sir, Chefs Ankush and Rooplal, Bearer Deepak, Barman Amit, and everyone else around ensured we have a fantastic stay.

In fact, there was heavy snowfall the day before we were to arrive and we faced a roadblock on our way. The hotel helped us out by arranging for a 4x4 vehicle (which were the only vehicles that were being allowed into Kufri at the time) at the very last minute.  The staff were polite and helpful throughout. The only small complaint I had was that the rooms were not heated enough. So we had to ask for an additional room heater.  The views from the room were SPECTACULAR! And monkey's come and sit by your window and watch you... which was pretty interesting!

shimla,"Given the fact that hill stations are outrageously expensive & crowded these days, the white ridge is just the kind of place one would love to crash in and unwind. Shimla and Kufri are hot hill stations in terms of popularity and population. To find a place, where peace and tranquility are relatively affordable can be an exhaustive task. Was more than happy to have landed myself into the white ridge for a break.  Its probably not the biggest property that Sterling's got. The location compensates for the spacial preferences.   The view from my room window would've been great, if it wasn't obscured by the clouds.   These days a night's stay even at an average place in Shimla Kufri could cost a couple of tons at least.

The resort arranged for some treks which were very picturesque. You got to see the entire mountain range with the snow. The best was the visit to the temple on Deshu Peak which was at almost 11,000 ft and you had to climb some 200 + stairs to reach the top. But totally worth the climb when you saw the view from the top.",lambasonia,/Profile/lambasonia,"New Delhi, India",40

We went by Volvo Bus and came back by Train i.e. Himalaya Queen.  We stayed for 4 nights in a premium room. Location wise it is O.K esp. for us as we go for restful vacation. Otherwise if you go with family and want sightseeing then you go by self driven car or will have to hire one. There is no provision for driver’s stay at the moment. Outlook of property is very good. Good Ambience. It has classic rooms in the main building  on roadside just adjacent to reception and premium rooms to the valley side going downwards from the road level.

Most rooms offer excellent view of the valley and have good decor, however some flaws such as the television of one room is interconnected with the television of the adjacent room through the same wall which makes the sound of each TV audible to the other room, room tends to feel claustrophobic which needs to be improved, however these are minor flaws compared to the excellent hospitality and service offered by the management and staff Our stay was during Diwali and the management and staff were sweet to make diwali happening for all its guests by organising a gala",Shivam Bhagwati,/Profile/BhagwatiSB,"Mumbai, India",40

Just make sure to confirm this because we saw few rooms facing internal court. The rooms are very specious and equiped with all the amenities one can ask for except for mini bar items. The staff is very well trained, polite and efficient. Parking is ample. Usually this hotel will always host some corporate function and hence parking might get bot messy, but staff takes care of the logistics.

The attitude of the staff there was completely below par as they were not bothered to see which guest came and did they want anything specific so much so they did not bother even asking for water. All of this during the off season, I can only imagine the plight during seasons. On the other side, the front office staff were very warm and welcoming.

I had been following up ( I am glad I did) with the resort to allot Larger Room On Higher Floor With Better View. Since I was following up on regular basis as our dates neared I did get a cold shoulder response asking if I was Member and if not I should send a mail request.

We were a family of 13 people and booked 5 rooms.Here are the things which we liked and disliked about this resort- Dislike- 1.If wifi connection is important to you- don't book at this place. We did not have wifi access during our stay. They kept saying some lines are broken and getting it fixed. They don't tell you at the time of the booking- that even if they provide wifi- it is available only in the lobby not in your rooms.  2. we saw some bugs in the bathroom which we don't expect from hotel for which we paid so much money.  3. last day- there was some Kirtan Mandali ( religious group) of about 60 people came to stay at the hotel and we could hear instruments and singing devotional songs very loud in our 3rd floor room. they,Madhu Chadha,/Profile/Mbcha,"Phoenix, Arizona",30

Further, the spa and swimming pool were not working. In activity room, there is a table football game which has all broken rods and should be removed. There is a pool table, chess table, carrom and few more games available.  Two adventure sports resort are close by and worth visiting.

shimla,"We stayed at Sterling Resort from 1st June to 4th June, leaving a day before our reservation because of the disappointing quality of rooms and service. We were shifted to rooms because of the non availability of a suite. The rooms seemed well equipped and comfy initially, but we were in for a shock,when we drew back the curtains on the main window, and the glass fell and shattered. Also, one of the rooms didnt have one of the windows and they'd put up a cloth in place of glass.   We ate at their restaurant the first day, and were served stale Dal and Paneer.
