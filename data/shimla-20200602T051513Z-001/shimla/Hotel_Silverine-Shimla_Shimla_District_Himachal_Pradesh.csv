shimla,"Although the hotel looks nice, once you freeze in your room, nothing matters.  To reach the hotel from the main drag, you need to go down a very steep slope which is even harder going up to town. I stayed there with Intrepid Travel in March 2020 and would not recommend it to anyone for the above reasons.  The mattress is hard as a rock, but the management added pillows and folded blanket to make it more comfortable.",Elisabeth S,/Profile/elisabeths275,,20
shimla,"We were two and stayed for one night at this hotel from 25-26 January,2020. The location of the hotel is amazing,close to Mall Road. It took us 2-3 minutes to reach Mall Road. The only drawback is, the road runs in a downhill direction for this hotel, which an elderly couple/person may not find comfortable. However, the staff took good care of us. I would like to mention the name of Sunil, who was really helpful, and was very soft spoken. The view from our room was also good.  We recommend this to everyone who wants to stay at Mall Road.

shimla,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 days- 18th to 21st Jan 2020 (room no. 309- Luxury suite). Had a wonderful experience. Smooth check in. Room service was prompt and efficient. Food at its in house 'Amhrosia' restraunt was good.The breakfast buffet was there on first day only. Second and third days they provided on demand service for breakfast but as a whole it was nice. Mr Sunil Darhel guided a lot and arranged taxis for Kufri, Naldehra and Chandigarh during return. The hotel is situated on lower Mall road near to High court and one has to travel a steep slide to reach the hotel..and similarly has to climb a bit to reach back to Mall road but this is manageable and it is everywhere the same in Shimla unless you choose to stay on upper Mall road.Hot and cold water round the clock in",BackPacker813873,/Profile/BackPacker813873,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40

In breakfast, the Dalia (similar to oatmeal prep) was really gud and filling. You can request the hote for a car service   As we requested for a drop to the parking area. Rooms were ok. They have kettles and other requirements. However the room I got was quite old and had a bathroom that looked very old and dusty. Hot water is available (they use solar facility).

The rooms are spacious but quite outdated. The bathroom does not have a shower curtain, and the ceiling is dripping water from the above floor. Some people used their laundry service and said they were happy with it.  We dined 2 times in their restaurant and asked them to not westernise our order (ie make it as spicy as they usually would), which they did. The food was absolutely delicious and it was one of the highlights of our entire trip. On the other hand, the breakfast was just bland.  Tip: the roof offers some amazing views of the mountains.

All rooms in the hotel face the valley.. the executive room is slightly bigger in size as it has 2 bay view windows instead of 1 in the other rooms.. the room has a king size bed and a sofa cum bed .. so 3 person can accommodate very easily.. bathroom is neat and clean too .. buffet breakfast spread is limited but extremely tasty.. even their in house food is good .. hotel is located very near to Mall .. only 5 mins walk .. service is very cooperative and warm .. ample parking place available too .. only pain is the uphill walk from the Hotel .. one needs to walk around 200 to 300 metres extremely steep road.. not suggested for senior citizens.. but otherwise a good place to stay ..,Abin_Ray,/Profile/Abin_Ray,"New Delhi, India",40

shimla,"I read the TripAdvisor reviews before booking this property for my stay (on 21st & 22nd November 2016), particularly the ones in the category of terrible and poor. I even read the response of the senior management to some of these reviews. I found the senior management’s aggressive response to some of the reviews very inappropriate.  Anyways what nudged me into booking this place was that the higher number of people who rated the property as Excellent / Very good.  In a nutshell what I found was a basic elementary and just adequate place. I was not expecting anything very plush/luxurious anyways.  I submit my review categorized as below. Let’s start with the positives. 1.	It is located at a short walk able distance to the Mall Road. Mind you though the walk is only for the young",SanjaySharma_69,/Profile/SanjaySharma_69,"Noida, India",30

However to reach Mall Road, u need to walk over a good steep hill like road which is tiring.

I would like to particularly mention two staff members, Girdhari and Jagadish, who were very accommodating right through our stay.  2. The food served at the hotel is very good, but the cost of their dinner buffet does not justify the limited items on the menu. 3. Location of the hotel is excellent. The Mall Road and Lakkar Bazaar are all within walkable distance.  Cons  1. The access to the hotel is through a very steep and narrow road.

shimla,To reach this hotel I not easy. 70degree stiff road is really an issue to reach there. roads are too narrow to drive. I have driving experience of 2lakhs KM (approx.) but taking out my car from that hotel was a nightmare.  Food was OK.  Rooms are fine. clean but not very comfortable.   Service is also OK. You need to follow them to get the things done.  But this hotel is better than other budgeted hotels.  Shimla Mall road is just 200 metrs away.

shimla,"While planning for the trip to shimla..i came to know about this hotel through a fren. Read the review and was skeptical after reading the reviews. But must say by choosing this place for the vacation...was good. People wrote about the steep climb from the hotel to mall road..but hey u are in hill station...and that climb is nothing. About room peoples review as of stinky room....but seriously...i didnt came across any such thing. One thing though....ask for executive rooms...these are worth. The view from the rooms are awesome. I have never come across such delightful staffs...service with such broad smiles. They even refused tips. The manager is very friendly. Food is good. Bathrooms are ok, Mall road starts when u climb up the hotel. Must stay i must say.",Dharam28,/Profile/Dharam28,"Kathmandu, Nepal",50
shimla,"When we reached the hotel, we were a bit disappointed with the entrance which was a steep climb down from Mall road. But once inside, we were literally won over by the wonderful service provided by the hotel staff. We were travelling with a small baby and the room service was very good in terms of providing warm water etc at any time of the day and night. Also, the room that we got had a wonderful view.",amitsrivastava,/Profile/amitsrivastava,"New Delhi, India",40
shimla,"I travelled in October, 2011 and stayed here for 3 days. Its an average hotel, nothing so special.    Firstly, if you are not so much hesitant in walking on a uphill/downhill (and i mean it, its a pretty angular walk to the mall road), then only choose this hotel. It is located near the mall road but again, to reach this hotel, u dont have much choices than walk, its a pretty narrow walkway to the hotel.  The rooms are not as big as expected, just sufficient.. but the bathrooms are small. there is 24*7 supply of hot water which is good.  The hotel staff is not prompt in their service. They do note things down which u want, but then, u may have to call them again for the same thing which was asked. There is not much adequate lighting in the rooms.

Still I always found the staff well warm in reception. our train was a bit early; reception send a cab quite fast. We had to wait for 10-15 mins as the rooms were getting ready but we have been moved soon after that.   And it was a real good big room, with a nice size bathroom with bath tub, sitting space but no balcony (not that it was required as it rains heavily in July).   Food was the best thing, I never need to go out and eat, we ate almost every time in hotel as they rates were quite economic as well.  Staff was good; I asked them to book a cake for my wife's birthday and deliver it at 12 in night; they happily did that (in fact they checked for egg less cake as well; which unfortunately",Aditya_Shrivastava,/Profile/Aditya_Shrivastava,"Cupertino, California",40

Our room was upgraded, the food is very good and the view from the roof deck is awesome. The staff has gone way out of their way for us, even sitting down with us and spending literally hours helping us plan the next leg of our trip. The owner is a really interesting and warm young guy from Mumbai whose office is right upstairs and who is always willing to help out.

shimla,"Having visited the Summer Capital before , and stayed at the Oberoi properties , Cecil & Wildflower Hall (both absolutely gorgeous stays) , was when a friend suggested Hotel Silverine for our next visit to Shimla. Just what we needed, a home away from home. It is simple yet comfortable without the flounce and affirmation of commercial properties. Family run and thus personalized & warm hospitality.  The view from the rooms are absolutely breathtaking, orange sunsets, and the clouded glow of the Valley. There is no wi-fi internet so i'ts goodbye to work & facebook, but who needs either when you are surrounded by this magnitude of natural beauty, history and genuinely wonderful people .

The hotel is situated right on the mall road , so you just walk a few steps and you are on the famous mall road of shimla , plus it was jus a few meters from the shimla bus stand , so i would say the hotel is most adequately placed for a small city  like shimla .   As for the hotel itself , all of its rooms are facing the valley , which provides a magnificent view of the valley just by peeping out of your windows in the room , and as u open the windows in the morning you are greeted by the cool shimla air.

For anyone who visits there please try their Chef's dishes and I would recommend the noodle soup, roast chicken and gulab jamun with ice cream :) You can also enjoy drinks on the terrace while over looking the beautiful Shimla.

shimla,The hotel is beautifully made. The staff is excellent and highly co-operative. What ever we required was pretty much at our disposal immediately. The food is great with a vast selection of cuisines. The mall road which is the tows hub for practically everythin is very easily accesable from the hotel. barely 45 seconds if im not mistaking. Parking is available for cars so you will not have the hassle to run to the muncipal corporation and spend over 600 for just 3 days. they provide free parking and not charge like the rest of the hotels out there. i would suggest you'll to try the sports and fitness parlour which is on the roof of the hotel. its quite nice and very well equipped with the english snooker and pool table and bean bags all over the place.

The property is a budget property at best. It is located at the very end of the Mall Road, near High Court. The rooms were small, and cleanliness was not at best. We had booked this property for a 3 day stay but we checked out of it on the first day itself, even though we lost money.

The views to the valley are breath taking, one of the best I've seen especially if you go when it's snowing.  It's a family run hotel, probably Gujarati or Rajasthani's, therefore they like decorating the place. Rooms are nice and comfy, nothing great but nothing to complain about.
