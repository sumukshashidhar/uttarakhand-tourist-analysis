Stayed in the superior room which i must say is pretty spacious. Ideal place for a peaceful vacation in the hills. While most reviews on trip advisor would echo similar thoughts as i have mentioned, will list a few points to keep in mind that may influence your choice: 1. The mattresses in the rooms are very soft. I found that a bit annoying since i am used to a relatively hard bed. 2. The balcony's have neatly designed grills for safety but there exists a big gap in between grills, which for my 2.5 year old was enough  to pass through, risking a drop from the 3rd floor.

shimla,I booked this resort for a holiday to experience the peace and quiet and tranquility which the place offered...great views and serene. The deal was for a superior room with additional add ons and the moment i entered the room and to my disappointment i saw that the beds were stained...the sofas were stained and soiled...No AC which also u can manage without....no intercom service so everytime u need housekeeping or room service or even a towel u make an STD call to reception. No tea or newspapers given till you ask for it....service was a huge dissapointment. The location is super but the roads leading to the resort are broken and a bit scary to drive to....overall not the best experience,Hardeep_singh01,/Profile/Hardeep_singh01,"New Delhi, India",20
shimla,An excellent place to stay. Wonderful and peaceful surrounding makes Flag House a perfect getaway. The hotel is well maintained and the staff is very helpful and co operative. They understood our leisure mood and served well. That morning tea in the balcony overlooking the valley was bliss.,aghavis,/Profile/aghavis,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
shimla,"My husband and I went to the Flag House Resort, Junga in March 2013.  I call it a trailer because two days wasn't really enough to sample the resort fully. But it was enough for us to be able to appreciate the peace and tranquility of the mountains, away from the hustle and bustle of the main Shimla town. The walks we took through the serene, green surroundings of the resort were truly a pleasure. As for the resort itself, the living accommodations and the fixtures were of the consistently high standard that one expects from a quality resort. The food as well was memorable. We also really appreciated the fact that the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and comfortable.  In some ways, we regret the fact that we didn't have more time there in order to recharge our",ashima6,/Profile/ashima6,"New Delhi, India",40

shimla,"I was at Flaghouse Resort in the month of June 2012, knowing that it would be a mad rush during the weekends I decided to stay in a resort away from the hustle and bustle of shimla. My gamble paid off. I decided to book a superior room as I was told that superior rooms are very spacious and have decent sized balconies. On my arrival I was surprised to find that the rooms were much more larger than some of the 4star or 5 star properties in Delhi. The view from the room was amazing and I could think how wonderful this place would be after the monsoons. Food being a important ingredient of any holiday, I was served with a perfect choice for breakfast and dinner. Lunch were usually outside. I would recommend this to anyone would love to pamper themselves within a very decent budget",Rishi_Del,/Profile/Rishi_Del,"New Delhi, India",50
