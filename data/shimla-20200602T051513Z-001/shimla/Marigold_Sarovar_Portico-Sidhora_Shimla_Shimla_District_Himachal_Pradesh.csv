We complained about it saying the settings of the vending machine is not appropriate, and hot chocolate looked like milk with flakes of chocolate.

Good things first before the list of woes: property is nice. Not a large resort but a medium sized with some open spaces. Views from premium rooms are nice. Housekeeping is excellent - so rooms  are neat and property is nicely maintained. That’s the only reason for those few stars.  Now the list of cons that spoiled our overall experience a lot: 1. Service is very poor - and in restaurant below worse! 2. Started with not being served the welcome drinks to majority of our group members.

I would like to list some good things first followed by some not so good things:  Pros: - Helpful and courteous staff - Neat and tidy rooms, I really liked the duplex cottages. Giving good privacy to a family of size of 4-6 people - Good food  Cons: - Location, There has been a major construction activity going ahead of the hotel which is restricting the valley view altogether. - This might not be the the control of hotels but macaques causes major nuisance in the compound and balconies, which is risky for kids.",Vineet_Malhotra,/Profile/Vineet_Malhotra,India,40

We were without AC for 2 hours after check in. And we couldn't keep the balcony door open due to monkey menace. They didnt bothered to change room for two hours! Now coming to food...taste of food was most average and did not matched the portico standard.  Breakfast buffet was also average and many of their bakery items were not fresh.

shimla,Stayed here for 2 nights with another family. The deluxe rooms were decent & clean. We couldn’t open the balconies because of the monkeys 😄.  It looks more like a business hotel than a holiday resort. The staff is efficient. They have a small kids room but no open space as such.  It’s in Mashobara so close to Naldehra but far from city centre. Wasn’t a problem for us since we had our own rented vehicle. ,anandqk,/Profile/anandqk,"Bengaluru, India",30

Just be careful - as the staff will advise you - of leaving the sit-out door unlocked, as the monkeys in the area have now learned how to open a door by turning a handle.  As has been pointed out, the hotel is in Mashobra, that is a fair distance from Shimla, so you can't really do the Mall Road trips etc. on a whim, you have to plan them - even if you have your own car, because it is a good 30 minute drive.

shimla,"I chose Marigold Sarovar Portico for two reasons – Its location outside of Shimla and my earlier experiences with I had with Sarovar Hotels.  Location: About 5 km from Mashobra town… midway to Naldhera. Quiet. Probably too quiet for some. You need to have a car to go anywhere.  Rooms: Superior room are smaller than regular Sarovar fare. No mini-fridge. Construction opposite the room meant loud noises all day.  Food: Well made. Dining on the terrace is a pleasure. But… breakfast buffet is very limited. My children, who expecting lots of goodies, were a disappointed lot. Also, there are no eateries in the vicinity. So opt for AP or MAP if you intend to chill in the hotel all day.

It's about 5 km from mashobra towards naldehra. Though the resort provides a luxurious stay with big, well appointed rooms and an activity area for kids with number of indoor games and beautiful lawns, the view of surroundings is not much great. In fact, there is no view of mountains or the valley from the room or the terrace. Food is quite expensive, with dinner at Rs 800 per person, and is not up to mark.

shimla,"The hotel is situated in Mashobra (around 12-18 km from Shimla town). The location is great with some nice views. Stayed with my kid (3 yrs) & wife for a day. Hotel staff is particularly courteous. We got a call to inform us that the Dinner was served & asking us when we would come down. The staff was polite with some genuine smiles. The food was decent. You would not have much choices around to eat outside hence would have to rely on the Hotel restaurant. but the food served was good & quality didn't seem to be be compromised.  Please stay here incase you want to relax & stay away from hustle bustle of the city.

shimla,"We stayed in Family rooms, which were very good and the top end ones. Decent view from the rooms. Recommendation is that choose family rooms, if traveling with kids. However there was construction activity in the vicinity, check if it is over, before you book. Other Deluxe rooms (duplex) also appeared decent. Duplex rooms don't have fans or ACs. So picking those rooms during summers may not be a good idea. Friendly staff. Extremely good food and buffet. Opt for their Break fast and Dinner Buffets, as there are no nearby restaurants.

Ill discuss my views point wise:  Rooms: The hotel gives 3 options , cottages, superior rooms and family rooms. The cottages have a garden along with them so the same can be opted to enjoy if you are a group of adults. We opted for Superior rooms in the new wing as we had liitle children with us.

First of all, there is no view from this property other than from just 1 cottage all other are surrounded by buildings. The pictures published by the management and many reviewers are fake and one can check even on google maps that there is a huge 4 storeyed building in front of the double storeyed cottages.  Worst that this is the horrible experience with the misbehaved staff at this place. Right from the time we checked in the staff was very rude and behaved as we were being obliged instead of the other way around.

shimla,"Delhiites always look for a break from the weekly routine filled with traffic jams, office stress, school chores, etc and will pack their bags at the slightest opportunity, like a long weekend. They look for a destination, preferably within 250-350 kms, which will take about 6-8 hours thanks to the good roads. The popular locations are Shimla, Mussoorie, Nainital etc, falling in different locations. But these have become too crowded and commercialised that after reaching there one will be forced to feel that the chaos of Delhi was better!!  That is why the less exploited, less crowded locations which are easily approachable are becoming increasingly popular. Those who already live in the midst of crowd wish to spend a few days in calm and serene natural environs. For such",ngkunni,/Profile/ngkunni,"New Delhi, India",40
