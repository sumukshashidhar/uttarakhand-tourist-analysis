shimla,"It is Club Mahindra's 50th resort opened a couple of years ago. The resort is located in a very nice location. Property is well maintained, cleanliness is up to the mark. Breakfast and dinner were awesome. The fun section for kids is good, although there were only some set of coloured balls for him to play with but still, my kid spent quality time in that corner.  I have stayed at many other Club Mahindra properties in Himachal and Goa. So if I compare Naldehra's property with other properties where I have stayed then there are a lot of differences that make other properties stand out than pristine peaks. The things in which they lack is hospitality. Yes, that is my experience.  Maybe because there is a shortage of staff.   -- When we visit any Club Mahindra property they greet",Chetan Sharma,/Profile/chetansharma123,"Chandigarh, India",30
shimla,"I visited Pristine Peaks (run by ClubMahindra), last weekend over holi. This is a very nice property with great ambience and comfort. I liked the scenic views and its location. But the issue here is regarding the food they offer. I read this in earlier reviews also, but when i reached this resort, i almost forgot about their bad food reviews looking at their infrastructure they are having. I was not able to believe that how could such a big hotel have poor food. We were a group of 6 and they charged around 6000 for the buffet dinner we had. Believe me they just had 3 veg maincourse options at a price of 1000Rs. Also the food they offered does not even deserve a single star. I mean such a big property and such poor food. I wonder why they dont look into this matter and get some",Munish S,/Profile/222munishs,"Ludhiana, India",30

The property is situated at the hilltop in all its glory and its stunning once you reach. The hotel staff is very cooperative and looks forward to help you in any kind.  We travelled with our 2 year old and his meals generally include khichdi or milk. To my surprise, the hotel didn't charge for my baby's food even once.

ROOMS : We had 2 studio rooms for 3 nights. We requested rooms in Cedar Building as it had the best views of the mountains and Himalayas. The View was breathing and probably the best view you could get in that region.   RESTAURANTS: Both the restaurants were good.  The Buffet menu was great with wide variety.  STAFF: The overall experience with the staff was no that great,the staff at the restaurant especially Pine View needs some training as they were not very friendly and behaving as if they were forced to work.

The origami made along with rose petals made us fall in love with each other all over again. Had a wonderful 2 night stay and would love to visit them again.

It takes 50 calls the entire day for someone to pick the phone. And when I state my issue I am told that someone will call me back and it never happens. Absolutely callous and careless approach especially to a member of last 15 years   It's a 40 lacs car and im tires of reaching out endlessly but they very conveniently do not respond and what fun they have of keeping the keys to my car I fail to understand.

shimla,V stayed in first week of april in room no. 1107 in cedar building. It is indeed overall a wonderful experience with a view of snow mountain on a sunny day .  Room facilities r good n the ambience of the hotel area is also very aesthetic loaded with full of scenic beauty . The other dav it Was foggy and there was rain too.The climate was also chilled enough even in april.  The best part is the hotel is situated on a hilltop of naldehra just like a private hill as there is nothing present there except the hotel.  Only the dissapointing part was the food as it was too expensive n jains hav very little options.  The village was also good if u want to experience nature n v drank tea at hilltop provided by hotel instructor. There v got 360 degree view of mountains ,Cutie9,/Profile/336cutie,,50

shimla,I with my wife were at Club Mahendra property at Naldehra near Simla for six nights. The property is five star and the staff is very cheerful and helpful.The chief chef Mr. Hasan is fantastic chef and really took great efforts to make special dishes for us since we eat only Jain food.  We really cherished the special item prepared for us called Dahi Kabab.  Even the front desk staff and entire team at the property were very helpful and cooperative. I have stayed at many properties of Club Mahindra in India but this was the best so far and would definitely go back again in future.
