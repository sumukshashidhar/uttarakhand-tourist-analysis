Despite few hiccups(beyond our control) and location part (which hotel management well takes care of by their complementary pick n drop) rooms are spacious, tidy and offers valley view. Hotel also offers outside activities like trek, Burma bridge, etc. But their best part is their restaurant Evoke where food is heavenly.

shimla,As others have said the main drawback is the very steep hill to the hotel. Until recently the hotel was owned by the Evoke chain of hotels. As they had only operated for 2 years why did they sell this one ? There is no swimming pool and it is questionable whether this is an international hotel. Very few guests and very few dined in the restaurant. No heating in public areas ! Bar not cheap and no atmosphere or customers. Receptionist very good.

The food is one thing which can be improved and the menu made more extensive.  The adventure activities are minimal and alright. the trek from the hotel into the pine forest is beautiful.

Good, because there is no hustle and bustle of city, no noise etc. You relax in calm and peaceful environment. Bad, as there is no market near way, you have to get everything from resort and whatever is available there, you can take only that. However, food is good here, plain and simple food just like homemade, not like other outside restaurant food with too much oil and spices. Rooms are clean and service is good, decent and nice staff.

shimla,I booked garden room here for two days. Room was clean and having good furniture. Staff was also very co-operative. But I found some negative points:  1. Location of hotel is 5-6kms away from main city. So we had to spent extra cab charges (350 each side to main city). I paid 4000 per night for room charges. So it cost me 4700 including cab charges which is not as per the hotel facility and room value.  2. Problem of hot water. No hot water supply for 24 hours. Everytime we have to ask staff for hot water. They start boiler on request and off it after 15-20 minutes. This is the major problem.  3. Paid service charges are too high. Like room decoration charges are around 2000/-.  Thats all about my experience.,jitenderkhattar,/Profile/jitenderkhattar,"Allentown, Pennsylvania",30

shimla,"We visited Shimla from 3rd may to 5th may stayed at presidential suite, room was quite good, spacious and it was wonderful staying, had a great view of the Deodar forest on the hill and we could hear the birds singing. Hospitality & service was excellent. We all friends & kids enjoyed all the adventure activities which is there at resort. I personally feel one should skip near by places and take maximum advantage at Shimla havens. Trainer of the activities was quite supportive and he encouraged us to do all activities there at the resort. We are looking forward to come back and stay at Shimla havens again.",Deepali V,/Profile/dips76,mumbai,50

This place was suggested by a family member and we stayed here for 2N/3D. The hotel is located at a nice location and the view form the rooms (1st floor) was very nice. The room had the best of equipment and the staff was very helpful. We had breakfast & Dinner included in our package and it was worth it. The good thing, the resort has a cafe downstairs where you can sit and view the hills and have a quite time if you like. The only downside to this place is its location, the roads leading to the hotel are very steep and it can be a pain if you are driving a car.

shimla,My stay at shimla Havens was very comfortable. The resort is a newly developed property very close to the natural forest. The resort serves food through live kitchen which is very good concept. The restaurant is very spacious with a open view towards the forest. They also have a well equipped jim. The best part of my stay was my early morning walk through the thick forest to a very famous Shiv temple known as SHIV BAVRI. The resort also has developed same adventure activities which are very enjoyable and thrilling as I saw many young couples enjoying them.

They offer Buffet system for dinner and breakfast but also allowed us to order individual food for dinner and also didn`t charge for any. they also have started their own adventure or activity area and its worth for money, though i have not tried any as i was there on a honeymoon trip and prefer to relax.
