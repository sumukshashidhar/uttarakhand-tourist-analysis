shimla,"My observations for the wedding ceremony of my Daughter arranged by Royal tulip luxury hotel Shimla(HP) It was wonderful experience for organizing a marriage ceremony of my daughter in the Royal Tulip Luxury Hotel Kufri, Shimla(HP) on  11th March 2020.  Mr. Anoop Thakur, Assistant Manager (Foods & Beverages) was co-ordinating the marriage event.  His personal attention and care made this event a grand success. This was attended by dignitaries of national and international reputes of Central/State Govt. and reputed aboard guests.

The staff were helpful like on Reception Akshay & Poonam were great and at the restaurant Rohan was great!  Disliked · This time when I checked in the hotel. My room literally had no towels are not basic items were available. I literally had to ask the reception update everything after an hour of checkin. As if the room wasn't ready. I checked-in on my the day of my marriage anniversary at around 2: 30 Pm and asked for a cake and for that I received call at 10 pm for delivery.

Went to Kufri and stayed at Royal Tulip Kufri . This property is located at the best location of Kufri .  Staff is courteous enough to make you stay memorable. We booked a deluxe room , but when they saw me travelling with the family, they themselves offered me a premium room without any additional price. Rooms are spacious enough . Premium room had an attached balcony and bath tub in the washroom. It's one of the biggest hotels in Kufri with impeccable view. Hotel has good road connectivity from Chail as well as from Shimla .

Their selection of food is pathetic, six variety of main course only but the manager over there tried to cope up by allowing us to order anything ( we took dinner buffet for 1400 for 2 for 5 nights).

The staff is however confused over handling of simple affairs. You order mozzarella sticks and they will serve you french fries instead. If you ask them, they will say Mozarella is out of stock. They give you lemon sponge cake when asked for CheeseCake. Apple pie can mean a chocolate cake wrapped in pie crust with a few minor apple pieces. You order dishes from the menu and they can cheat on the ingredients and portion size very easily.  For reference, look at the photos attached of what they call Apple Pie and Lemon CheeseCake.

Ideally hotel should inform families making booking during private event tenure about such event taking place during personal time out stay. During private party if guest peep in while you swim looks odd to each other.  Roof top could be better maintained and pool area had no support in terms of security or towels after pool.

I had called in the hotel for a possibility to move check-in to next day because my car broke down on the highway.. I knew my booking was under non cancellation. However I tried because I was travelling with a 1 and a half year old kid since 7 in the morning from Gurgaon and would have not reached Kufri by 12 midnight given the situation.Even car service center told us that it will be very late.. I spoke to the receptionist at the hotel.. he was very nice. tried to understand and do everything in his capacity. but told me that his manager did not agree to the change and told me to come to the hotel by 1am to 4am -,pragatidhirajmakkar,/Profile/pragatidhirajmakkar,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",10
