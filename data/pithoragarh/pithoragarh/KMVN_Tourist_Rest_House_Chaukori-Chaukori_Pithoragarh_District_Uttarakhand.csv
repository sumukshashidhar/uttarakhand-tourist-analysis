The staff, quality of food and the great Himalayan views just blew me over. And then I stayed here again in November 2017 and that was my moment of Sach Ka Samna. it's a perfect example of what a disinterested staff can do to ruin a hotel. Infact our miseries started even before we set foot in the hotel. During that trip the staff KMVN Munsiyari staff went to great lengths to make out stay comfortable, the staff here started throwing tantrums even before we started moving to Chaukori to Munsiyari.

Best time to view the snow capped peaks is from Nov till the end of December when they are visible throughout the day. 4. Sunrise and sunset are good with changes in colouration of the peaks. They are indeed a visual delight. 5. There is no taxi stand in Chaukori and hence if you do not have your cab, it has to be arranged from Berinag and you must inform the manager beforehand. 6.

Chaukori KMVN is good as have stayed at Cottage C3 and good for stay for 1 Night.  Remote area Chaukori is with nothing to do.  So people only stay here while passing through heading towards Munisyari from Kasauni.

pithoragarh,"We stayed here along with my parents this May. We had the wooden cottage and a room in the main complex. The cottage became quite hot during the afternoon. KMVN has a large property with a good view but the upkeep is not great. The rooms are in a bit of disrepair - the linen and the bathrooms could have been in better shape. But the staff is very helpful and rates are quite cheap. However, Chaukori is a very small place and there are not many choices. It gets quite full during the summer, so book early, online. I would recommend the Ojaswi, close by, if you are looking for better rooms. We were unlucky for not being able to have view of the snow clad Himalayas due to poor visibility caused by forest fires.",Shailesh Kumar,/Profile/srishailesh,"New Delhi, India",30

But they did not have room service. 5.Wooden cottage, clean toilets, nicely kept but the view can only be seen from the back. 6.Food was very basic. The menu mentioned Kumaoni recipes but even the basic dishes like Gutka Aloo was served like north-indian aloo fry. 7.Non-veg is prepared on demand with additional making charges. 8.You could club the trip to Chaukori with Patal-Bhuvaneshwar and Beri-Naag though road conditions are not very good.",SjAwadh,/Profile/SjAwadh,"New Delhi, India",40

However, there are only 2 hotel options you have at Chaukori, one KMVN and the other a 100 meters ahead of KMVN.
