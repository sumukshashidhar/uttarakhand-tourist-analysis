pithoragarh,"This place is about 5 mins before Udyari Band and maybe 3-4 kms from Chaukori. I landed here without a plan in particular and this was actually the best part about my trip to Uttarakhand this October. Located on a mountain, surrounded by forests and beautiful meadows this homestay is the stuff of my dreams. They have reasonably priced rooms, tree house and even camping options available for the stay.  There are hikes around the property that took me to gorgeous views. Including a zero point that allows one to see the entire range- it took me 30 mins to get there. But since it's a uphill climb, it might take some about an hour to get there, said Tarun Ji. He is the one who runs the property alongside his beautiful family who are so warm and caring that you wouldn't want to stay",Payal,/Profile/uzuuumaki,"Dharamsala, India",50

pithoragarh,"Extremely happy with my stay at Mr. Tarun Mehra's homestay in Chaukori, booked through your website. The homestay is located at a beautiful spot in the village- spend the day looking at the snow-clad Himalayan ranges from their premises, and gaze at the multitude of stars in the night. The homestay had comfortable beds, clean rooms, and hot water available in the bathroom. Enjoyed traditional home cooked meals cooked by Tarun ji's Mom. For those interested in adventure, there are MTB trails, rope climbing, ladder climbing, etc activities that can be enjoyed in and around the premises. Would like to visit them again and stay for a much longer time. Three cheers to Tarun Ji for developing this gem of a homestay!",Neha P,/Profile/819nehap,,50
pithoragarh,"Kaaphal Hill truly defines of what a homestay should be. It mirrors the traditions and culture of kumaon himalayas in more than one way. The organic foods cooked, hospitality by family, local guidance by the host are par excellence. The place is quaint and perched in the nature.  Host Tarun Mahara left no stone unturned in ensuring a comfortable, cherishing stay. Besides, he knows a lot about birding, mountaineering, hiking and trekking.such a memorable stay.

pithoragarh,"Perched amidst kumaon Himalaya, kaaphal hill leaves you astonished and gasping as you roll your eyes on the mountain ranges like Nanda devi, Panchachuli, Nanda kot. Not only Does Kaaphal Hill provide a cosy stay, organic foods direct from the farm are palatable and tasty.  Bird watching tour early morning is a must in your bucket list. There are different species of birds found in this property.  A trek to waterfall will rejuvenate you and let you feel the nature in whole.   The family is beyond praise. They are always available in your service. Other interesting things in this farm are MTB track, meditation centre and a walk to the vast expanse.

pithoragarh,We reached there at around 9:30 PM without any prior booking and information. The road was not less than a thrilling trek. Amazing experience. We stopped the car and we found that we are in Jungle. A men came and told us yes rooms are available. It is very difficult to describe the entire hospitality in just few words. Uncle and anty were very good. Entire family came there to serve us dinner. And specially anty prepared Raghi halwa for us.

pithoragarh,Tarun and his family were very hospitable and helpful throughout the stay. Vegetables and other items were plucked fresh from their garden and cooked. Food felt fresh and tasty.

pithoragarh,"It was one of the most authentic rural home stays we have experienced in India so far, and our hosts were incredibly warm and welcoming. Apart from the beautiful location, the highlight of our stay was the delicious, healthy, organic, fresh off the garden Kumaoni food, served on the floor of the the family kitchen, which also serves as the dining area.   Please note that they only serve vegetarian food (you can request for boiled eggs though) at the family kitchen, and in case you want to make your own food, there is separate tent, with a gas burner and some basic utensils and an electric kettle.   For us, it was a total immersion into a Kumaoni rural home, and was as genuine and complete as it can get.

pithoragarh,"Location: 4 kms from Chaukori (towards Berinag). The house is in the middle of an Orchard  overlooking a beautiful valley. You can view the entire range of Kumaon Himalaya from the guest area. Accommodation: It's neat and clean. There are 4 rooms to choose from, but the best part is that only 1 booking is accepted at a time, thus making the experience super private. The hosts live in their traditional house, guest rooms are built on the floor above. Food: This is a speciality here. Nothing is market bought. So everything that's cooked is super healthy and at the same time super different and delicious. Hosts: Tarun lives here with his parents. Both of them are the sweetest persons one can meet.

pithoragarh,"Tarun and his parents run this place. Their place is in a semi jungle setup with flowers , exotic plants , wild life and a few domesticated cows for fresh milk .  The thatched kitchen cum dining room is a  sit on the floor arrangement is extremely nice and hygienic .   The entire hill above them is a combination of dense forest interspaced with fruit and vegetable gardens leading to a pine forest towards the top of the hill  The hill top offers amazing views of their pristine surrounding countryside and the higher Himalayan ranges - one where one can spend hours wandering around .   They are lovely hosts who make one feel completely at home and the home cooked kumaoni food is amazing . Tarun's mom is a gold mine of information of nearly everything that grows around them.

pithoragarh,Kaaphal hill Homestay and adventure center is indeed an ideal place to relax in the backdrop of famous Himalayan ranges. Clean and neat rooms amidst fruit and vegetable farms and kaaphal trees make your stay as close to nature as is possible. Food served has local kumaoni flavor and is completely organic from the farm. The hosts are very warm and leave no stone unturned in making your stay memorable. You can get information and access to lesser known adventure and religious spots in Kumaon region. A must visit for all who want to try something different.,Jinkss,/Profile/Jinkss,"Bengaluru, India",50
pithoragarh,We stayed here only for a day. The 24 hours we spent here were awesome!! Tarun and his family are great hosts. They serve delicious local Kumaoni food. Early morning you can hear different sounds of birds. You can go up hill to get a panaromic view of the snow capped peaks and you can also go hike down into the valley in the jungle. We had a great great time. We wish we could have stayed longer. Definitely recommend this place because we are surely going back again ,Neha B,/Profile/416nehab,,50

The place is home to large verity of birds, a resident snake - it's non-poisonous, and occasional visitor include leopard, wild boar and bear.

One can see a lot of birds and animals within the small campus of Kaaphal hill. Tarun and his brother Raj have preserved the nature such that a lot of these birds and animals are attracted towards this place. This was the best part of the entire stay here.  The cleanliness is one thing which was beyond our expectations. Though the facilities are very basic, whatever they have to offer is very neat and clean.   The food was wholesome and tasty. It was served with a lot of love. Most of the things are organic and are produced in house.
