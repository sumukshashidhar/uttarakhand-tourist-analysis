pithoragarh,"The first thing about this place is that it difficult to locate,and when we finally found out, reaching the hotel seemed to be the greatest struggle for us as it lacks a proper entrance. On reaching the spot we found out that the rooms were totally unworthy of this struggle.Small shabby dingy stuffy well no adjectives are enough to describe the condition of the rooms. We could not stay there for a single minute though we had made a full payment for two days. ",Chaity C,/Profile/chaityc2017,,10
pithoragarh,We had paid for a 3 night stay at this place and checked out within half hour. Close to the tribal museum one has to walk through people's houses to reach this so place. The location is pathetic and Munsiyari is al about the breath taking view of the panchachuli peaks. It was a total ripoff and wouldn't ever recommend. The staff is courteous and food ok since we had lunch there.,shweta1662016,/Profile/shweta1662016,"New Delhi, India",10
