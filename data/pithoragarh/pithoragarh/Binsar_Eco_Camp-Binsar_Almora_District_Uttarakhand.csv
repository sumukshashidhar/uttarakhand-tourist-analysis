pithoragarh,"Binsar Eco Camp has everything that you can ask for to have a good , peaceful holiday. It‚Äôs away from the hustle and bustle of polluted city life; offering a spectacular  view of the Himalayas if the clouds don‚Äôt take over. Thankfully, we got a crystal clear view of the Nanda Devi peak, Trishul Parvat & the Chaukhamba glowing majestically in the sun.  It‚Äôs approx 55 minutes away from the Binsar wildlife sanctuary and around 30 min from Golu Devta temple. This property offers a far better view of the Himalayan range than the much sought after zero point at the sanctuary. The food offered at Binsar Eco camp has a beautiful kumaoni flavour.

They had organised a trek to river and the trek continued in between the forest which was amazing! We had Teheri as lunch just beside the river.   Food here is excellent!! So no worries about food.

The stay was kind of homely one, the owner , staff are polite and friendly . The staff for  room service have a scope for more members as I find there was only one guy to help you with your needs. The amazing thing about the place is the calmess and its serenity , the view downwards towards the valley from your room its breathtaking , and if lucky to see a misty cloud cover over it, its like a paradise for any photographer. The view of Himalayas from the temple near the camp is also majestic.  The zero point too offers a great view of Himalayas .

Breathtaking views of himalayas..serene surroundings..it was nature all over I could see. We would go there as many times as possible. The host is most amazing and who truly believes in mehmaan is bhaghwaan and a friend. The eco-friendly rooms of the camp made our stay extremely comfortable.  Right from our first step into the camp our experience was surreal. Ravi, our host, was very cordial and took very good care of us.

However, a mobile tower is located right next to the property, so one does get uninterrupted, good voice/data services...   Ambiance is great, hospitality is good and food is very homely.. The view from the camp is very good and a 5 minute hike up the hill to the ridge gives you a panoramic view of the Himalayas (if the weather relents, that is.. ).

pithoragarh,Last year i planned with my friends to visit binsar Eco Camp.we were four families. i was from delhi & others were from Ahemdabad.After a tiring journey from delhi we reached Binsar Eco Camp.Oh God such a beautiful place.we all were fresh. Here you can feel the nature. the flora & fauna of this place is amazing.Excellent Rooms and excellent room service.The plus point of this place is that there are no T.V in any room. Just feel the sweet smell of DEODAR in the room. Last and not least the Nature of Mr Kesar Singh Mehra the owner is brotherly.Delicious food of this place is also the speciallity of this resort.

pithoragarh,"Firstly it is 30 Km away from Binsar...The stay is comfortable as the place is quite serene.... The main issue was food as once u go there u r at mercy of the owner....Sometimes even the basic things like milk,bread,butter and cornfalkes are not available....Rooms are comfortable and the place is excellent.....My advise is to detail out your food preference with the owner before making the booking....Also the place is not as big as it looks in the photograph.,,Jungle walk option is good.....",Ankur_RubyJain,/Profile/Ankur_RubyJain,"Kota, India",30

pithoragarh,"Our experience to binsar, eco-camp was marvellous. we had been here for 5times in an year!! becos of its scenic beauty and purity of nature make's us visit soo often. its hard to keep your eye off this place. mr. mehra uncle is a wonderful host and his way of presenting makes the stay more comfortable.Unique Geological formations makes this place more fantasy. snow peaks + night galaxy with millions of stars adds up to the natural beauty. loads of birds can be seen. one should visit this place and feel the nature. its spectacular.!! :) there's no bad experience to be highlighted.",ishasharmauno,/Profile/ishasharmauno,delhi,50
