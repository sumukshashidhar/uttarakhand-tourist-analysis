But I must say we lucked out and were able to catch the magnificence of Trishul peak. On a good day one can easily have entire range view including the Nepalese side.

You are better off having these, as the property is self sufficient & delightfully remote.

The next 3 kms road looks treacherous with the jeep ride on first time, but we realized that it is really not so dangerous after we did it second time. The guy who drives the jeep , makes it all the more fun. So it is ok, just a bit of adventure before you reach a tranquil place.  The property is vast , secluded and beautiful. Well beautiful is an understatement. Just the the sitting area in front of our cottages itself was worth all the journey.

We travelled with our pet dog and the staff was very helpful with him . The rooms were clean with an abundance of confortable warm blankets. The food was delicious and homely, and service was excellent . The staff is very informative and thoughtful about planning your day trips ,excursions, and treks. The activity centre has a small library , with books stocked for all tastes, an indoor badminton court and a carrom board . The resort offers stupendous views of the High Himalayas . We loved the lawns of the resort , complete with hammocks and picnic tables. We suggest that an indoor eating area should be built , in case the weather",Sghosal,/Profile/Sghosal,"New Delhi, India",40
pithoragarh,"Far from the maddening crowd I mount up & up & up & up.........!!!!! I sail the sea, I walk the land, but to tread the trail of Misty Mountains, I sure would need a hand!!!!!  It takes a lot of adventurous zeal & love & passion for the mountains to reach The Misty Mountains Retreat! I realized this only after reaching there!! So fellow enthusiasts gear up for a tumultuous ride to a territory like never before!!!  I would have possibly not thought of such an escapade, if it was not for a dear friend. But it was worth it!! Reaching there is a task & so expect the unexpected!! Everyone wants to do different things in life, this voyage is one of them!  After our night train journey from Old Delhi station by Ranikhet Express, we head towards the most daunting ride in the mountains",monica j,/Profile/realmonu,mumbai,40

pithoragarh,"It’s an amazing place with something to offer for everyone’s taste. You get up in the morning to a magnificent view of snow clad Himalaya from your cottage. Far away from maddening crowd,  you rarely get to hear the sound of motor vehicle in the day. Serene & clam for someone who wants to spend time with own self. For trekker enthusiastic, it’s a paradise. The local guide offers the detail history of the region while you trek through the thick jungle of pine trees. The wild life enthusiastic does not have to go to national park, you are most likely to encounter a leopard or a tiger at the most unexpected place.  Apart  from all this ,the food is simply excellent..the warmth and care of the staff is such that it even makes 5 star hotels look like 2 stars….",nitin36,/Profile/nitin36,"Mumbai, India",50
pithoragarh,"We (me and my wife)  stayed at the Misty Mountain resort in October 2010 end for 3 nights.  It is a marvelous place, words are too less to describe. It is place where the raw natural beauty of the Himalayas are preserved in its true form. Great views and great people. The cottages are great especially the mezzanine floor where you can lay down and watch the great Himalayan range. Food is also great. In the evening they have the bonfire in which you can enjoy the local Kumaoni dance and songs. A huge activity center which you will never expect in a remote place like that is there, having facility of games like Table Tennis badminton etc. If you are lucky you can even get a glimpse of Leopard which unfortunately i couldn't but our driver got it.

pithoragarh,"This is a great place to escape from it all. Be warned that the location is obscure and a tad bit far to reach but that’s the price one has to pay for exclusivity. In a nutshell, below are some tips and pointers  Getting There: Take a train from Delhi to Kathgodam. Then hire a car till the resort Alternatively, you can drive there in your own vehicle  I made the mistake of hiring a car for the entire duration of my stay. This is not really needed and a pickup and drop from Kathgodam will suffice Point to note: The roads have been battered in the monsoons and the drive is not very comfortable. Check with the resort owner for the latest update  The Place:  The rooms are simple and clean. The staff is attentive and genial The group/ family cottages deserve a special mention.

Sit up in bed and look out of the clear glass window, for a view whic surpasses the most creative imagination.  Add warm hospitality, impeccable staying arrangements, cozy cottages and good home cooked food, you will wish you could stay there forever.   When we embarked on our trip to Misty Mountains, we had no idea we would come back spell bound. The magic begins right on the winding roads, cut through dense forests growing on steep mountains. Driving through the swirling mists increases the anticipation of what awaits upon your arrival.   You wont be disappointed.

pithoragarh,"This place is simply mind-blowing. Case in point, we visited it for the first time in 2009 and repeated in 2010, all the way from Bangalore. People think we are crazy. But if you see the view, you'd know why we did it!!  Misty Mountains is an other-worldly experience, in terms of closeness to the Himalayas, if you are not a trekker. On the worldly side, the cottages are wonderful, spacious, very well maintained. The staff is warm and friendly. The owners, Madhur and Ambika, are lovely people. A stay of 4-5 days passes in a flash and leaves you wanting more. It is a place where you go to find stillness of the mind. Activities include walks, treks, hikes, picnics and bonfires at night.
