pithoragarh,"We reached Berinag in the afternoon and after completing our program, reached Hotel Himalaya Darshan around dusk.  The wind was blowing fast and weather turned quite pleasant.  We sat on the rooftop to have some soft drinks and snacks and enjoyed the experience.  Rooms are facing east and the morning view of the valley below this hotel is just awesome.  Food quality and service is also good.  We enjoyed our stay at this quite place.",RAJENDRA884 PRASAD,/Profile/GuruGhummakad,"Faridabad, India",40
