pithoragarh,"Clean washrooms, passable rooms, that's all about it. Tariff isn't high but Hotel is like children growing up on their own without any parental supervision. Booked 4 rooms for 2 nights. No front-desk staff, no one for enquiries, no restaurant (food from outside if order placed in advance), broken geysers in all rooms (staff will fetch water from one working geyser but for 8 of us how much time will it take?), not even waste-bins in rooms! Paid for morning tea the previous night, got assurance to be served on time but they didn't have milk at the right time!!   Avoid if possible.",patrickjones300,/Profile/patrickjones300,"New Delhi, India",20

pithoragarh,Rooms have nice view of panchachuli peaks. Average food but at economical rate. Nice rooms. Overall a good hotel to stay. Always do advance booking in munsiyari as hotels pack very quickly at seasons.,shudhanshu u,/Profile/shudhanshuu,,40
