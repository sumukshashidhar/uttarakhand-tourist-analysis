pithoragarh,"I booked this hotel for our Munsiyari visit during Durga Puja vacation at the last moment and that time there was no other option.  But the amazing view from our room (Room no. 102) surprised me . Though the hotel needs some more cleanness otherwise it is okay. Dheeraj (who is looking after all the guests ) is very energetic , help full and and always has  a smile .Food was limited options but fresh and tasty.I wish to all of you are planning to go there a pleasant vacation hopping  to stay here . The hotel little away from main crowded part of Munsiyari. That's why one can feel the beauty of the place.  Our room was very specious.",Sumana Chowdhury,/Profile/sumanachowdhury,India,50
pithoragarh,"My tour arranger booked rooms in the month of July'17 for our stay on 1st., 2nd and 3rd. October that is 3 months in advance and despite that, the rooms with view of the mountains were not given to us. Can you imagine? There was a mix up also. My booking was for the above mentioned dates but they said it was for 30/9/17, 1/10/17 and 2/10/17. This was despite the fact that my tour arranger confirmed my dates through mail. I had to contact the tour arranger to smooth the condition which ultimately could have done away with since I did not continue there but left for Chaukori the very next day.  The hotel is good otherwise, not great but good. View from a side, the side not allotted to us, is great. I found a shortage of staff there. The manager and only 2/3 boys which I feel is",SChoudhury,/Profile/SChoudhury,"Guwahati, India",30
