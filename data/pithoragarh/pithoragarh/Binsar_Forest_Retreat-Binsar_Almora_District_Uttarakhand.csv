We took a train to Kathgodam from Delhi and then hired a car from the Kathgodam Railway station. The drive was nice but the ghat road is bad for people with motion sickness and when we arrived at Binsar Forest Retreat we got a warm welcome by Preetam and Pallavi ( resort owners) and their 5 year old Daughter Ahana who guided us to our rooms :)  The hotel layout is very nice and location is fabulous. The rooms in the resort are very nice and relaxing. The property is very nice and nicely planned out. We had 3 rooms booked for us (2 Thrishul cottages and 1 Nanda gunti room) .

pithoragarh,Nice place to rejuvenate. Natural and wild. I mean really wild. It is good if you like to see the wild side of nature and dont mind leaving the comfort of modern life like having electricity in the room to sit and read a book in the evening. Found it a little risky as the approach road to the hotel is very narrow. :) if u are adventurous then it is not an issue.  Staying there you really start to question your purpose on this earth as a human being as there is nothing else to do.  Liked the wild Burash flower trees. These flowers are harvested to make a nice refreshing and bright red coloured cold drink. The hotel also provided the Burash drink. Little expensive place for me.,MeetuA,/Profile/MeetuA,Bangalore,30

Though, there are no modern amenities here and this runs on solar power, they ensure you have no problems with anything at all!! They'll even fetch you hot water for a bath.

Fridays to Sunday should take slightly more. - Either you can have lunch at the Udipi restaurant at Kathgodam or at Kainchi Dham. Otherwise, you would find several smaller joints/dhabas enroute.  - Keep margins for traffic jams since road infrastructure remains the same while traffic booms.

The place it tucked deep in the forest and accessible only after a short climb in a 4WD vehicle. All the tests are spread out and at different levels proving you with your own space. We stayed in the newly built cottage and the adjoining tent and the accommodation was as comfortable as it can get with great food and wonderful service. The Staff is helpful and courteous and they really looked after very well.

For those who truly want to get away from the stresses of modern day life in cities and be with pristine nature, the opportunities are few. The Binsar Wildlife Sanctuary, within whose sylvan embrace Binsar Retreat nestles, provides one such.

pithoragarh,"Binsar Retreat, Binsar Uttrakhand  Date:  June 2011  We had booked three luxurious tents in this fantastic resort for the entire family, as we had gone with our friends and family.  It was a remarkable and unforgettable experience, a holiday that we will probably remember all our lives.  The resort is quite small and intimate with only 3-4 rooms and around 5 luxury tents.  The price may appear a little steep, but is well worth it once you get there.  Another fact to keep in mind is that the food (excluding lunch) is included in the package.  The tents are truly spic and span and what is more to the point have an absolutely modern bathroom attached with them.

The setting is awesome with the lush green trees buzzing with birds and bees, fantastic flowers and gorgeous weather.   We stayed both in the cottage and tent and loved them both - cottage for the cosiness and tents for the thrill (not that these were not cosy). The best part is the pampering we got from the staff in terms of being courteous, room service and the quality of food.

My only suggestion is that you know what you're getting into: you're not going to a place with `activities'- no TV, no game room, no electricity in fact. It's inside a nature preserve. But it is perfect if you want to get (comfortably) closer to nature, see the mountains, hike in the forest, see beautiful birds, and in general, recharge your batteries.  What to do while you're there: have Mr. Rana at the hotel arrange a guide (Raju Bhatt-ji was ours) to take you on a walk through the sanctuary. See the mountains, see the forest.

If you visit in summer, one of the greatest pleasures will be to sight a large number of wild animals. The leopard is a special attraction and so are the innumerable species of birds.
