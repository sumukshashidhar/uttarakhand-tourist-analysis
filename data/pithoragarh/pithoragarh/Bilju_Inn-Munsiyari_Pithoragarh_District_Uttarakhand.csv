pithoragarh,i stayed in this hotel 2 nights i.e.5.4.19 to 7.4.19  with my wife for family holiday. we are sr. citizen. The hotel is situated in ideal place of Munsiyari view.

pithoragarh,Hotel is very good right on the road. Rooms in newly constructed building are big and quite modern . Food was ok. The only thing is staff are not trained enough to handle situations when hotel is running full occupancy . Fact is Munsiyari is very remote and to get staff must be a challenge for hoteliers but they had people to work just training was lacking.,Deep S,/Profile/182deeps,"Bengaluru, India",30
pithoragarh,"Stayed here for 4 nights and they gave us the room on top floor which is appreciated. The room was clean and comfortable and gave good view of the mountains which was our requirement. The hotel though is along the road and not a very exclusive location.  Staff is helpful though ill trained e.g. enters the room without knocking. While checking out the owner/manager made this entire tantrum about giving us room for cheap and he didn't know about so low rate on booking.com, which left us with a bad taste.   Before checking in (esp. online booking) it would make sense to clarify price and inclusions (e.g. breakfast) with the management as they seem to hallucinate and  dream about charging higher pricing.",kaushal21fb,/Profile/kaushal21fb,"New Delhi, India",30
pithoragarh,"We stayed at Bilju Inn on 3 January, a family of 5 persons. The travel to Munsiyari was bit tiring as the roads are not maintained and mountain driving is strenuous.the hotel is located just at the beginning of the town with the shops a 7 minute walk away. we could see other better looking hotels too but Biljus inn met all our requirements. Staff personnel are friendly. Kitchen hygiene needs to be improved upon- if you are finicky about cleanliness, then eat from one of the dhabas in market place.  Morning tea is served earliest by 7 am and the windows open out towards the Panchachuli peaks giving you a feel of an amphitheatre. Walk around, trek to Khaliya top, see the Museum (Tribal Museum), Nanda Devi temple and go to Darkot in the day time to see the ancient village and buy",praveen g,/Profile/gundappa,"Juba, South Sudan",40
pithoragarh,"the hotel is located in the beginning of the beautiful hill station Munsyari. stayed there for only one day in six bed suite with my whole family. The room was very spacious, will decorated and very clean. it has tow attached bathrooms and bed was very comfortable. But the best thing was the view. if you are a lazy person and do not want to go anywhere,  you can watch mesmerizing view of Himalayan peaks not only from your room but even from your own bed. If you wish you can come out from your balcony and directly face the mountain, the cold winter breeze and listen the most melodious chirping of birds. Hotel owner Mr. Brijwal is a very nice person and ready to help you every time and so is the staff. Food is excellent too. The only mines point is lack of wifi but i was told that",singhsaheb,/Profile/singhsaheb,"Mumbai, India",50

You can have the view of total panchachulli range even from your hotel room although we enjoyed the sunrise and wonderful sunset from the terrace. ,Aniruddha N,/Profile/RINTU73,"Kolkata, India",40
pithoragarh,"The hotel is located just as you enter Munsiyari and is 2-3 km away from the city attractions. The rooms are good and offer direct and amazing views of the Panchachuli peaks. Food is super spicy and it is better to inform them to make less spicy food. There is nothing you can find fault with, although there is nothing exceptional to it as well.

pithoragarh,"The hotel is at a perfect location giving awesome views of Panchachuli , has spacious, neat and clean rooms. The staff is very courteous, food is good, considering the fact that Munsiyari is a remote place and has constraints , this hotel is safe and ensures comfortable stay. It was for the staff named Bhagwan that we could do 4 kms uptrek to Khuliya Top with a 8 yrs old kid with us, he guided us on the trek and kept on pushing us through the steep and at places snow covered routes to lead us to the amazing spot all covered with snow. The town is 1.5 kms away from the hotel , it is advisable to have food at the hotel instead of venturing in the town.",rinita p,/Profile/rinita2017,"Navi Mumbai, India",30

pithoragarh,We stayed here after hearing a lot about it and we happen to know the owner as well but even then our experience was not good.  The hotel is located in a busy area of Munsiyari and lots of homes right next to it so its kinda noisy till late in the evening. The rooms on the 2nd floor have a big terrace attached which was good but the rooms themselves are small. Also the bathroom has open windows which give a clear view of it to the adjacent homes ! The hotel staff said the windows will fog up and nobody will see inside ! Huh ?? The worst part was that a group of college students was also staying and creating a lot of noise which we tolerated for a day but the next day they started playing music at full volume in the evening and cheering loudly disturbing the environment.

pithoragarh,"As we reached Munsyari at 8PM in the night (on a sudden impulse decision earlier in the day), the only choice of stay was at Bugyal East End Rooms at the Bus Stand. However, I made sure that we ate our breakfast at Bilju Inn the next morning and also had a look at the rooms.  The Breakfast was quite delicious and value for money. We ordered Curd-Paranthas, Cutlets and Sandwiches but the availability of the menu items was an issue. The Ground Floor Room which we looked into seemed quite enough for a family of 2+2 if there were extra beds.  I think I would definitely keep Bilju as a stay option the next time I visit Munsyari.",Ankit G,/Profile/GAnkit,"New Delhi, India",30

pithoragarh,Had been on official tour to uttarkhand. Looked out to at tourist guest house of govt. Due to some technical problems could not get a room. Took a chance to check at Bilju.

pithoragarh,"This time we landed up in Munsiyari on 27th Dec without a prior booking thinking that at this season people might opt for the happening places leaving Munsiyari alone. But to our dismay our first and second choice of Hotels  (Milam Inn and KMVN) were not available and we had no other choice but to stay at Bilju Inn. If one were to compare the rooms at Milam with Bilju would say not much of difference in terms of cleanliness,facility, service or value for money . They were at par. Only difference is the location. Milam is isolated (our type of liking) where as Bilju is in the centre of the town. Food was good and service very prompt. Mr Bisht the owner is always around to look after your needs and desires.

pithoragarh,"After repeated postponment of our trip to Munsiyari, this Oct.15 we made it at last. After a long tedious journey over some not so good motorable roads, we reached Munsiyari in the late evening. It was 'Purnima' or full moon and we got the first glimpse of the peaks (Panchachulli) at a bend, the full moon just hanging over the peaks in the twilight and for a moment it was as if we have reached 'Devlok'. At the next bend it was gone. I had never seen peaks from such close range. The sight of the peaks in the clear morning sky is simply awesome. There is a dearth of good star hotels in Munsiyari and the food is passable but who cares? Govt.owned KMVN is the best located hotel.

pithoragarh,"About Munsiyari: Munsiyari is an unspoilt place in the remote Kumaon region of Uttarakhand. If you wish to have clear and close view of the Himalayan peaks (Panchhuli), this is the place (sometimes rain or clods can play spoilsport, so check about the season). Reaching Munsiyari, is not very easy as it is about 200 km from Almora and 500 km from Delhi. Delhi almora takes more than 8 hours and the rest of the journey also take the same time. So one will have to break the journey somewhere near Almora/ Binsar. Just before reaching Munsiyari the views of the peaks appear which will be more than enough to cool your body and soul and make you forget the tiredness.

The double bed rooms are small; not sufficient space to keep or open your luggage comfortably, small and congested bathrooms with no place to keep your toiletries.  There is no room heating even in the freezing winter nights. You can however rent room heaters from the hotel management at additional cost of Rs250/- per heater per night!
