pithoragarh,"It was the worst stay experience. the hotel staff is v unorofessional and do not know how to respect the personal space of others. the staff members kept bothering me and my friend by knocking the door again and again. Knowing that there are two females staying the fellow kept moving inside the room with stupid excuses like for checking the bathroom fitting and cleaning the room which we did not even ask for. we ordered coffee with bun, after serving the breakfast the guy kept coming to our room to have the coffee glass back in every two mintue. I did report it to the hotel manager and left the hotel the v next morning. Hotel manager who was available at the billing counter also did nothing. I would never recommend anyone to stay here",komal r,/Profile/komalr150,,10
