pithoragarh,Stayed here for one night in April 2018  Pros:  1) The staff is courteous and helpful. 2) The meals were served at our preferred timings. 3) The food was exceptionally good. 4) They have good accommodation for the drivers. 5) Tariff is cheap 6) It is a very quite place. 7) Rooms and bathrooms have acceptable level of cleanliness.  Cons: 1) This is far from town (about 3 to 4 kms) with hardly anything to do nearby. There are no views of the mountains from the hotel or anywhere near it. 2) There is no WIFI in the hotel. 3) The rooms and bathrooms and the amenities and furnishings look tired and as I said above are only to an acceptable level of cleanliness. 4) The TV is a small cathode ray box with limited number of channels.,rmanoj,/Profile/rmanoj,"Pune, India",30
pithoragarh,"Stayed here for one night enroute to Munsiyari. The hotel is located a few kilometres before town. From the foreigner registry book I was the first non-Indian to stay in 18 months! Accommodation was provided for my driver, but I didn't like how the management refused to let him have hot water for a shower despite promising me it will be done (I even offered to pay for buckets of hot water). Room was OK but dim. Had to request for toilet paper and a clean(er) towel. The main switch for the water heater is at reception, so I had to ask for it to be switched on. Shower pressure low, had to resort to using buckets.",HinYeung,/Profile/HinYeung,"Singapore, Singapore",30
pithoragarh,The Hotel has well furnished rooms which are very economical. The Hotel is on a mountain ridge and it has a very good view of the mountain ranges. It has enough space for small parties(20-30 persons). It has enough parking space too. The best part is that the manager and the staff are very cordial.,Jai1976,/Profile/Jai1976,"Trivandrum, India",50
pithoragarh,Good location a bit away from the town and crowd but poor service and maintenance mars the locational advantage.   Badly understaffed resulting into poor service needs lots of improvement in management of the hotel. ,Sudhir Kalra,/Profile/SudhirK260,"New Delhi, India",20
