I would return to Himalayan Glamping for that view alone. The tent was well furnished - we had a few glitches with the water heater, but they were remedied soon. There was a cupboard, side tables, an extra bed for my son. The bathroom was well equipped.   The hospitality - Rupesh was so kind to my son - treated him like a big guy - my son was thrilled.

That and the excellent hospitality we received from Rupesh and his team - everything was so clean, well organised and efficiently executed.
