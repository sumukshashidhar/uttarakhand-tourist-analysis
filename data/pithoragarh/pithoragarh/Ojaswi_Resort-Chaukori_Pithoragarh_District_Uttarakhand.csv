pithoragarh,"It was during my second visit to Chaukori that I stayed here. This was May 2013, on our return journey from Munsiyari. The only reason I stayed here was because the KMVN property next door was full. Well as regards the property, it's fairly new. Hence it was clean and well maintained. That was it. Don't have good memories of interacting with the staff there. It would not be wrong to say that they were least interested in what they were supposed to do. Considering there are few options to stay in Chaukori, this property should always be a second choice, unless perhaps the staff has improved their attitude by now.",Pankaj Toppo,/Profile/Toppopankaj,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",20

pithoragarh,Normally most of us use Chakauri as a night halt for our travel to Munsiyari but Ojaswi Resort at least has made me think that now Chakauri can be planned as a destination itself. The resort can be driven to directly from Delhi in a day -11 hrs of comfortable drive if you leave early morning.. The resort is very easy to locate (very near the KMVN complex) and has a well planned and thoughtful layout. Each of the rooms have excellent views of Himalayan range though I personally preferred the ones on the first floor as it has its own private balcony.

The view from the hotel is nice but if you just get out and walk for like 2 mins to the back side of the hotel you have excellent view of the himalaya's. We found a beautiful house but spooky at the same time behind there but excellent place to just capture some great shots of the hills and the valley. Over all if you are looking for a nice peaceful holiday this is just the place to go to.",Vasu84,/Profile/Vasu84,"New Delhi, India",40
