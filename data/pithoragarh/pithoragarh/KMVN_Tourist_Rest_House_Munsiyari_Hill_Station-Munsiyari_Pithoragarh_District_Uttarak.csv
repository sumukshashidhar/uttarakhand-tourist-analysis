pithoragarh,"The KMVN property is Munsiyari is undoubtedly one of the best places to stay. I had stayed in this property in November 2017. It is located at the entrance of Munsiyari when coming from Kalamuni Top. The property is well maintained and offers amazing views of the Panchachuli Group. If you have an option stay on the first floor of the new block. The views from there are truly awesome. The staff, including the manager at the hotel are always willing to help. In our case, when we were checking out from Munsiyari, the manager personally called up the KMVN property in Chaukori (our destination for the day) and informed him about our tentative time of arrival in Chaukori. Small gestures but they really help. The one dish that you should try here is Gandhrani chicken. A chicken dish",Pankaj Toppo,/Profile/Toppopankaj,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50

The rooms were stunning but what was more stunning was the view from balcony. Once the booking was over we ordered coffee and just continued staring at the mountain range from our balcony.

And with this arrival began our three-day long peaceful and wonderful stay in Munsiyari. We had booked two royal rooms on the second floor. The royal rooms are on the second floor offering a very good view of the Panchchulli peaks and Milam Glacier. Food was delicious. Room service we received was also very good. From the room and the balcony one can have a great view of the Panchchulli peaks. We found the members of the hotel staff very courteous and helpful. They helped us by providing us with information about places for local sight seeing. Overall it was a very,BIBEK B,/Profile/Bibek12,"Kolkata, India",50

But no place to sit anywhere in the campus except a broken sofa in the reception area. Rooms are small but the saving grace is that sheets are clean and the bathroom is spotless.  The canteen is dirty and crowded and you have to wait ages to get a table. Food is awful with very poor hygiene, stinking utensils. Two in our group fell sick. However, service is excellent...very prompt and friendly staff.  In general, Munsiyari is not very tourist friendly. 90% shops remain closed at most times.

Food options are limited, mostly Indian cuisine (dal, aloo based vegetable, Roti, some chicken, aloo paratha, eggs etc). All rooms have automatic geysers (woked very well), heaters are offered during the winters. This place receives heavy snow in winters. Understood from hotel manager (Mr Arya, quite helpful) that the place remains open in winters too. There could be few days when the roads get blocked due to snow, but government snow / road clearing machinery is working well during most times. Best way to visit during winters is to call the TRH and understand alternate roads and road conditions.  ",AmBan0306,/Profile/AmBan0306,"Mumbai, India",40

But, we reached the destination safely.   Hotel: KMVN TRH is located at a good location. Rooms are facing the Himalayas. We got the room on 1st floor and it has good view of the mountain.

A non trekker could't have asked for better. The post sunset views were a feast to the eye from the balconies of our rooms. The hotel staff was polite, courteous and caring. They prepared good ad fresh food with n their limitation. The timing of our visit was unexpectedly bad as the rains started at night and continued for 2 days allowing us to tour munsyari only in the morning on the next day. But the hotel staff did their best to keep us happy although there was continuous power cut due to a transmission interuption 300 km away from Munsyari.

pithoragarh,I did a riding trip to Munsiyari in Dec 14 with friends. We stayed at KMVN as one of my friends is a big fan of the place.   Location : KMVN has one of the best views of the snow capped mountains and I could see Nanda devi and trishul parvath from the room  Bathroom : Was clean and had hot running water. The only problem was the the water pressure was low.  Beds : Were comfortable but nothing too great. Extra blankets were provided on request  Food : Was very delicious and made in true kumaoni / pahadi style. Please ensure that you order in advance and that the kitchen closed by 10 PM.  Service : Was nice. We asked for a bonfire and they arranaged for it although it is not a service they provide  Power backup : They don't have generators and hence no power back is provided.

But like all govt. properties the place is a little run down. The carpet in the room is weathered and torn, the bedspreads are quite thin and low in quality, the cleanliness is not great, the chipped paint on the walls, the threadbare cushions on sofas, its all somewhat reminds you of what could have been done to save the place. What I also do not like about these places is that there is no shower curtain to differentiate between wet and dry areas of the bathrooms and that really maddens me, as a small investment would have done that.

It takes almost 12 hours to reach Munsyari from Kathgodam railway station with 3-4 stops for food etc. (If you like fish then do no miss the couple of small eateries around Thal on the way for a meal of spicy river fish curry and rice) It is an extremely hectic trip if you do not have at least 3 days in hand excluding your arriving and departing days. We had hired a cab to pick us up from Kathgodam station (charges were Rs 5k one way for a sumo / similar vehicle). The hotel is located in a valley with mountains on all sides.
