pithoragarh,"Finding a decent  hotel in the interior parts of Kumaon or Gharwal  region is not easy ! So, we ended up choosing this hotel by chance. The Hotel is in middle of a busy bazar in Pithoragargh. Car parking is a huge challenge. Even if you find space to park, pulling out the car from the middle of the bazar next morning is almost impossible. Food is reasonably good, but services can test your patience.  Also, there's hardly any choice for the breakfast. So, if you decide to eat out, you have to walk up few hundred meters to find few restaurants.  Watching television in the room is a luxury; if you are lucky with the quality of  signals/reception. For the average or below average quality of rooms, food  and services provided the tariff is unjustified. One of the very few positive",YatriForever,/Profile/YatriForever,"Chennai, India",30
