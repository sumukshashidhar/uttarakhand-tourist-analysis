pithoragarh,The hotel is situated just beside the KMVN property which has a superb viewing watch tower which is open to all. The rooms are pretty big though the washroom could have been better. The foods were tasty and reasonable. ,CA Shuvam B,/Profile/cashuvamb,,40

pithoragarh,"Me and my wife stayed here on our motorcycle trip to Munsiyari. Hotel is located just besides kmvn, on the main road with sufficient parking. Reception is at the top,  for rooms you need to climb down, ie. top floor rooms come first followed and the lower floors. Rooms are basic, toilet clean, 24hrs hot water through gas geyser. Check out is at 10am, although online sites mentions 12. Views are good but for better views of sunset and sunrise just walk down to adjacent kmvn, which has best views and a viewing tower. Although they have a restaurant, but when we were there you had to place order in advance. Food is freshly prepared and fine. Management could be more professional, although they were good to me.",Pradeep S,/Profile/764pradeeps,,40

pithoragarh,"Reached the hotel without booking.. good location with excellent view the only problem was the room as all the rooms were booked, had to settle with room with no views. Other rooms were good. Service is good with lots of parking area.",Ujjalmahanti,/Profile/Ujjalmahanti,kolkata,40

pithoragarh,"The hotels in hilly area starts with some 2nd or 3rd floor and to access the rooms one needs to be get down. In case you have elders, ensure to select rooms which needs list climbing up or down. As such room service is given in most of the hotels. In this hotel the dining hall is not within the hotel building but outside though easily accessible and in the same premises. We reached here quite late at around 9 pm and hence couldn't enjoy the beauty of the place. The hotel is situated just at the entrance of the town. We got up at around 5 am as we were suppose to start early for Patal Bhuvaneshwar the room opened to the scenic view of the green mountains spread all across. It was daylight at 5 am here. That is quite normal in hilly area. The hotel rooms were good, also the",PrashantTN,/Profile/Useful_reviews,"Mumbai, India",40
pithoragarh,"I booked this hotel through Cleartrip. When we reached the hotel, they gave us the worst room at the lowest floor. No network inside the room. You have to come out to make a call.Reception at the 4th floor, so service was late. We requested for rooms at upper floor, but man at reception was very rude and did not listen, as we had alredy paid for the room online. They were giving room at a much lower rate to people who came directly. So you feel cheated by booking online. There were mosquitoes in the room so we had disturbed sleep.",Hemant P,/Profile/468hemantp,"Bhopal, India",10
pithoragarh,"It is hard to criticize sometimes but we were not impressed by the service of Hotel Himshikhar at all. First of all there was confusion all around about what our tariff included we opted for Deluxe room at discounted rate but then we were not given complimentary breakfast. It was not the big issue but when we had to leave urgently a day before as scheduled.The manager insisted so much on money that we gave up because we had to leave. His attitude was not at all helping. We thought the hotel might understand our problem and will excuse us but they were hell bent to take money from  us. Also room was not proper in shape, Windows of toilet were makeshift and TV had only 5-6 channels. All these tiny problems made our stay terrible.",vaibhav pandey,/Profile/vaibhavpandey,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",30
pithoragarh,"It is a fabulous hotel given the restriction of what can be obtained in the rough terrain. People can opt to stay either in the cottages or in the main building of the hotel. The rooms are very big, warm with a comfortable bed and enough blanket, dressing table, table, sofa, chairs. In some of the rooms the toilet is western and very elegant in appearance, in others it is Indian with a separate bath. Everything is clean. The rooms are attached along a long common balcony. I guess the peaks are visible from the windows and balcony itself on a clear sunny day. I cannot guarantee this as during my time the weather was not good and misty. The hotel also has a game room with table tennis and carrom. The top floor is where the parking and reception is!! Yeah! That's the beauty and",TaniaBanerjee,/Profile/TaniaBanerjee,"Navi Mumbai, India",50
pithoragarh,Nice hotel at low cost. Parking is available. Cottage are nicely located you will get the view of mountain s from your rooms Windows and also from front garden. All time hot water and very quiet place Food quality is also good but service to towards the cottages will take long time because cottages are situated in very much lower position from the main buildings. Staffs are nice and gentle.,Harit Dasgupta,/Profile/dgharit,"Murshidabad, India",50
pithoragarh,Overall a good property just beside KMVN chaukori. You can easily go and watch beautiful mountains from the watch tower at KMVN. From this hotel also you have good view from the terrace near restaurant. We stayed here for 4 days- in cottage and in deluxe room. Cottages are average in maintenance and view.Deluxe room is better in maintenance.This time I was really surprised that UKhand hotels whether govt. or private  are not providing  fresh bed linen and towels. This needs to be taken care off.There is no wifi facility as claimed on its website. Food is good. Staff including manager are very courteous and ready to help you.2nd best option after KMVN in Chaukori.,Seema Shukla,/Profile/sseema,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",40
pithoragarh,Chaukori is a gud place to visit. And Hotel Himshikhar is best property for stay at chaukori. Hotel staff is gud. In core zone of himalaya they provide nessasury services.  Himalayan range and valley looks awosam from hotel. Sanset and sunrise looks very beautiful at morning and evening.,Yogesh B,/Profile/yogeshb306,,50
