pithoragarh,We stayed here in Royal room which has best view of Panchachulli. It feels that the Panchachulli can be touched from the room. Services were superb. Rooms were good. Foods were as usual superb. Safe and best locations of Munsiary,sarnab250,/Profile/arnsengupt,,50
pithoragarh,"This was family trip.Stay was very pleasunt. Nice property location is extremely good ,you can see best view of Pancha Chuli mountains range. Most of the people in hotel were to go for trekking however we did not. Must visit place. ",Madhutri,/Profile/Madhutri,"Thane, India",50
pithoragarh,Constructed on the finest point to watch great panchachuli peaks.Good and soacious rooms. Fresh food. Quality room services. Parking place.you can get everthing here in an affordable price. Stay here with your family.,rkprimus,/Profile/rkprimus,"Haldwani, India",40
pithoragarh,Well maintained and with a great kitchen. The service is excellent too. Very reasonably priced and a great option given the location and remoteness of the place itself. The beds are comfortable and almost every room offers excellent views of snow capped peaks. ,SGodiyal,/Profile/SGodiyal,"New Delhi, India",40
pithoragarh,You can view the Panch Chuli peaks clearly from the Balcony of the Hotel. Try to book the rooms on the 1st or 2nd Floor. The staffs are very helpful and the food served was good. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. The lawn in front of the Hotel badly needs maintenance.,debmuk2017,/Profile/debmuk2017,"Kolkata, India",40
pithoragarh,"A great place to visit.Munsiyari is a paradise for the nature lover. The forests that clothe the lower reaches are stunningly attractive with colorful mountain vegetation that includes besides others, rhododendrons. This dense Himalayan forest is home to a variety of birds and animals such as whistling thrush, wagtail and hawk cuckoo, falcon and serpent eagle, and leopard, mountain bear and the musk deer.",nagesh w,/Profile/856nageshw,"Kalyan, India",50
pithoragarh,"Location is good...but there are many hotels with same view. Was in family room. View was good but only from window, no balcony....Other rooms in new building had balcony..but 1st floor view was blocked by old building Staff is helpful, food OK....Prices of dishes were reasonable as in all KMVNs... View from parking lot was great.",NJM61,/Profile/NJM61,"Mumbai, India",30
pithoragarh,Incredible view of the Himalayas is available from the window of your room.Nice clean and spacious rooms.Great supporting staff and excellent food. Market is near by and Nanda devi temple is 2 kms away.Highly recommended.,Salil B,/Profile/457salilb,"Bathinda, India",50
pithoragarh,"We reached the KMVN hotel after a grueling drive from Chaukori, but after settling in and seeing the view, all the fatigue kind of disappeared. The restaurant is actually a canteen and the cook will try make something from what is available. Food is okay. But, once again the view beats everything else.",Kartik D,/Profile/864kartikd,"Mumbai, India",40
pithoragarh,We visited the place in June which is a high tourist time for the place.the property from outside looks very beautiful but the rooms are poorly maintained.Dustbins were not cleared n were smelling.blankets were of cheap quality..they refused for room service even some handful customers were in the hotel..food was gud but no variety..the mess of the hotel was worst than the mess of some college hostel..not a paisa vasool hotel..,Divya U,/Profile/DivyaU35,,20
pithoragarh,"The hotel is in the best location possibly in the most beautiful place in Kumaon. Inspite of taking the best available option of room, we were thoroughly dissatisfied inspite of providing a different room adjacent. The issues are wrt lack of maintenance and basic facilities. We identified a big security issue of the same key  can open locks of adjacent rooms - as we had been moved from 305 to 306, my wife by mistake tried to open 305 lock & it opened and then she realized she is in the precious room. Food is also bad quality wrt other KMVN & basic hygiene issues were observed - alu parathas fried & kept on newspapers in kitchen & then served on a plate in the dining. We were so dissatisfied that I requested them to swap with Chaukori KMVN and reduced our stay in Munsyari!",Kaushik_Basu_1969,/Profile/Kaushik_Basu_1969,"Kolkata, India",20
pithoragarh,"Roads towards upper Kumaon ends at Munsiari, a large village situated on the slope of a mountain. Just on the opposite slope you have the lofty Himalyan peaks including Panchachulli, Trisul etc.  KMVN's TRH is strategically located on the upper slope of Munsiari. One can get best views of snow clad mountains from the balconies attached to the rooms. It is a three storey building. on the ground floor, you have reception, large dining room and pantry. Tourists' rooms are on the first and second floors. Second floor offers best views. one word of caution - the staircase is very steep, senior citizens and those having knee aches may find it very difficult to go up and down the stairs few times a day. Rooms are very comfortable, staff are very courteous. We went two days after",anirban1954,/Profile/anirban1954,"Kolkata, India",40
pithoragarh,"Visit the place to see the Himalayas dape in colour during sunset... Reflection of sunset on Himalayas..Colour changes from Yellow to Yellowish Orange, Orange to Red, Red to Pink and finally moonlit himalayas. Panchchuli peaks are huge in size.. few local treks.",HotatSangha,/Profile/HotatSangha,"Noida, India",40
pithoragarh,I have booked one 4 beded room before 4 months from my journey. After reaching there I found it is terrible dirty room with damp all around the wall. I instantly denied to check in the room. Then authority has allotted me a delux room with low priced and offer a mattress to make up. They are charging for extra 200/- bucks for heater which is really surprising. The gyser was not working properly. Food at restaurant is not good. This property has two part. One is new and other one old. All the rooms pertaining to old building are horrible. View of Panchachulli is excellent. I do not find any justification of Spending 2200/- per night for this property.,Bhaskar Chakraborty,/Profile/MakeMyTour,"Kolkata, India",30
pithoragarh,"We visited Munsyari towards the end of September, 2014 and stayed in KMVN TRH in Munsyari. From Chaukori we set out for Munsyari on a cloudy day and after travelling in our hired Tavera for nearly three hours enjoying the view of the beautiful falls on the way, we reached KMVN TRH Munsiyari. As we checked in at KMVN TRH in Munsyari, it was still cloudy hindering the view of the Panchchullis. But the next day we were blessed with the wonderful view of the peaks as the clouds disappeared. What I noticed about views of the snow capped peaks in Munsiyari is that if the sky is clear to some extent, one gets to see the beautiful peaks while in Kausani and other places like Deenapani, the sky needs to be absolutely clear if one is to have a very good view of the peaks. But in Musyari",BIBEK B,/Profile/Bibek12,"Kolkata, India",50
pithoragarh,As any of the KMVN properties; this has location advantage. If you are staying any of the third floor rooms; you will be able to see entire Panchachulli range from your bedroom and balcony. That’s it. Rest everything is poor to average. It’s the worst KMVN property I've visited thus far. I believe responsibility goes to management. They are careless. Breakfast will never be served on the time mentioned. That’s because they don’t have adequate stuff to cater specially during the time when property is 100% occupied. However natural beauty is phenomenon. There are better hotels available nearby.,JayantaBose,/Profile/JayantaBose,India,30
pithoragarh,"Location . It's only thing which describes this property. From the rooms only esp on 2nd floor, it's almost 270 degree panoramic view of panchchuli peaks. That's it. Rooms are simple but more than read. Food is simple but suffice. And when you are there for mountains, this things don't matter.",manishpatel68,/Profile/manishpatel68,"Modasa, India",30
pithoragarh,We stayed here for 2 nights. It was an eye's delight to watch the Pancha Chulli from the room balcony round the clock. The view may not be so good from the lower category rooms. The rooms were maintained well. The food served was also tasty.,RBan26,/Profile/RBan26,"Bengaluru, India",40
pithoragarh,"Munsyari has arguably one of the best views of the Himalayas in Kumaon. This is a typical KMVN property with a good location, nice views from the rooms and ok food on offer.  Probably the best hotel in Munsyari for want of better properties in that area.",Sid Pakrasi,/Profile/SPakrasi,"Mumbai, India",40
pithoragarh,"Munsiyari is a very thickly populated town with a close up view of Panchkuli. If you come from Binsar, viua Chaukori, you start off with a broad view of the range that gradually narrows down to PAnchkuli at Munsiyari. The rooms are neat and clean. The food is OK. Views are good from first floor, but should be better from second floor. The disappointing aspect is that there is no common balcony (a la Binsar or Chakori) for viewing the golden sunset. It is a good budget option - far better than say Pandey Lodge which is located in the midst of the market. While I would recommend Munsiyari and the KMVN, compared to say HPTDC in Kalpa, I would say that Munsiyari is somewhat over-hyped.",ZHusain,/Profile/ZHusain,"New Delhi, India",40
pithoragarh,"Munsyari is a beautiful place with an amazing view, so irrespective of where you choose to stay, you will enjoy to its fullest...I went there on my honeymoon and chose to stay at the KMVN Hotel since Govt Hotels are always located at the best possible location with the best view....the hotel, staff, amenities was all available as expected. We went for walks in the evening though it was dark and too quiet, with the sound of the blowing cold wind....just amazingly romantic and god damn cold...!! We stayed there for 1.5 days as there was not much to do except soaking in the view and enjoying the cold shivers...do go for the short 'treks' nearby...I forgot the name of one particular trek that was about 6 km long on top of a hill...was worth every hardship!!",Nilanjana P,/Profile/mimlee,"Kolkata, India",30
pithoragarh,We got a 2 bedded Royal room which offers the best views of Panchachuli right from your hotel bed. The hotel has a big open area as well which is right in front of the peaks. Location wise it is the best option out there. The food served is OK but not excellent as such and dining area is average. Rooms are OK and relatively clean but there are opportunities of improvement. Having said that it is the only nice option in the remote village. 5 Stars for location.,Amit K,/Profile/AmitK194,"Kolkata, India",40
