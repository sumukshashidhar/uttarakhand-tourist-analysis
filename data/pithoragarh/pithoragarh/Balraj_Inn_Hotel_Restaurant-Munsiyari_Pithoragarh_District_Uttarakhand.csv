pithoragarh,"We have booked two rooms during March 2018. The hotel has 2 floors with 4 rooms in each floor, each room is associated with a balcony. In two of the room in each floor, you will get clear view of Panchachulli peaks from the windows of the room and for the rest two rooms you have to come to the balcony to get the same. The rooms are good, well decorated and clean. The hotel is a bit outside from the main market. Hotel manager and the staffs are very supportive.",seal_sum,/Profile/seal_sum,"Chinsurah, West Bengal, India",40

pithoragarh,"This is a small hotel with few rooms, it is at the upper part of Munsiyari and just at the road side. While going from Thal to Munsiyari we got this hotel as we entered Munsiyari before the market area. The rooms are of a sufficient size with a king bed and other furniture, a dressing area separately with a cupboard and a toilet. Every room has a balcony facing the Panchchula peaks. the rooms are clean , the food is simple and home made and room service is good enough. The owner is very supportive and helped us to move around in the city and also for trekking. The main attraction of this hotel is the balcony from where one can enjoy the spectacular view of the peaks and also the looking beneath you get the view of Munsiyari. The price is reasonably good as per the facilities,",AnilaSurin,/Profile/AnilaSurin,"Ranchi, India",40
