pithoragarh,"Munsiyari is the last frontier. As the name suggests, this is last major village before the road ends and foothills of majestic Himalayas start in true sense. In fact, Panchchuli range is so close from here that you are literally in its lap. Wayfarer Mountain Resort provides perfect combination of hospitality, warmth and proximity to Himalayas to experience this.     One falls in love with Munsiyari even before reaching it. Roads leading to it from Tejam (or till Tejam via Shama) are absolutely stunning. They are scary too, but thereâ€™s invitation in them to experience this rugged beauty. With altitude gain, comes change in vegetation, fauna & absolute clear water springs and emerald rivers (Gori Ganga). We can visit Munsiyari just to experience this journey!

pithoragarh,"First and foremost , it is not a resort . It is at best a home stay, which also second rate one which is saved from being third rate by the efforts of the staff to salvage a bad situation and of course the view ( which anyway would be the same from all of Munsiyari) To get their you first have to find it! There are no boards anywhere and you can only keep asking for the tribal museum through the entrance of which you have to pass to get to the ""resort"".Even standing outside the museum you would not know this was right behind.We had to ask a local shopkeeper who shouted out to the manager to come get us.. As a first our confirmed reservations were either not communicated to the unit by noida office or anticipating a no show the rooms had been given away to someone else.(since we",neeleshkulkarni,/Profile/neeleshkulkarni,"New Delhi, India",20
pithoragarh,"The property is located about 1 Kms after Munsyari market area. The entrance to hotel is little weird as from main road one has to take a steep upward small approach road which goes to Tribal Heritage Museum building. After parking vehicle one has to climb up & there are few houses & museum building, within which a pedestrian pathway will take you to hotel property. The property as such is small but well maintained. Rooms are of good size and bathrooms are neat & clean. The bed sheets, towels are also cleaned & maintained. A small team of 3 people is managing the property reasonably well.  Best part of property is the view it offers. Panchachuli peaks can even be viewed from within the rooms. Food quality is fine considering you are in Munsyari. Not much space is there except",PiyushK_Triphill,/Profile/PiyushK_Triphill,"Noida, India",30
pithoragarh,"Went on a family holiday to Munsiyari and was wondering where to stay to have a highly close to nature experience. Then we came across this resort which looked just what we were looking for.  We stayed here for 3N/4D and obviously there were some pros and cons which I would like to highlight here. Pros: 1. Excellent location with great views of panchchuli range. Just next to the tribal heritage meuseum which is a must see. 2. Well maintained...neat and clean property. 3. Very warm staff. Highly responsive to your needs. 4. Great food. Just like home food. Prepared it as per our need. 5. Generator on demand if the electricity goes...I preferred darkness, hence on demand...plus we had the luxury of being the only occupants.  Cons: 1. Parking of the property has a very narrow",Pranav N,/Profile/PranavN_11,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
pithoragarh,"The Wayfarer Resort is away from the main town of Munsiyari, which is actually good  as its away from the crowds. The view of the Panchachuli Peaks is great. Rooms are comfortable and food is of good quality. Mr Negi is very helpful and takes care of the guests well. The treks nearby are arranged by them if required at no extra cost.",amars79,/Profile/amars79,mumbai,40
pithoragarh,"The location of Wayfarer Mountain Resort is surrounded by all GREEN and entire range of Panchchulli is visible from all the windows and balcony. We will remember the full night when we stayed awake in chilling cold enjoying the White Mountain peaks - a delight for photographers. The Resort is not one easily approachable when we visited but that was more than compensated with the location, service and the environment. If anyone interested in calm, peace and uplifting mind space, do spend some time here. The resort also arranges short Treck trips. All in all A Five Star from my experience!",Sourav18,/Profile/Sourav18,"Bangalore District, India",50
pithoragarh,This Hotel looks at The Panchachuli Range Of Mountain Peaks in The Himalayas. The view on a clear day is fantastic. The Hotel has v.basic amenities. Hardly any variety in food is available. The hand towels are pathetic. The maintainance is poor. There was no manager available for the 2 days that we stayed there. The hotel is also far from the township. The staff ( which was all of two people---one to cook and one to clean ) did what they could to make our stay comfortable but they had their limitations and we were v. Disappointed with the Hotel. Would not recommend it to anybody at all.,Urvashi J,/Profile/urvashij,"New Delhi, India",20
pithoragarh,Just landed at Munsyari heading to Nanda devi national park just checked in in beautiful rooms with Nice view of Panchulli peaks eight in front.

pithoragarh,"We landed at the Wayfarer resort on an October evening - feeling cold & chilly. But the magnificient view of the Panchachuli right ther in front of view seemed to underplay the other inconviniencing factors. the cottages / tents were cold & provided no heating facility at this time of the year. We were the only guests in the resort that weekend, so got a royal treatment in a way but had to also bear with the limited choice of food as per the available supplies in the kitchen. the staff was friendly but we got the best service only after the Manager arrived from Ranikhet. In any case, we enjoyed our stay due to the location of the resort & the  view. the good news is that the resort is getting relocated and renovated with new concrete structures with hot water showers and other",bloretravelbug,/Profile/bloretravelbug,Bangalore,30
pithoragarh,"The view of the Panchachuli peaks is breath-taking from the resort. But do you really need to put up with the near-about awful condition of the property for the view? Might as well walk upto this place for the view. Still, each place has some plus and negatives. Some happy points: * Staff is extremely nice. * For dinner, there were not any choices but whatever they had dished out for us was very fresh and delicious. It was home food but better than home food.  * When you wake up in the morning and step out of your cottage and see the huge, white, himalayan range in front of your eyes at a touching distance, its quite a morning.  Not at all happy points: * No facilities in the resort.  * Tin roofs.  * Bad beds and mattress. * No hot water. I mean, the staff will get for you as",Vertika P,/Profile/VertikaP,bangalore,20
pithoragarh,"I had intended to stay here but as soon as I looked at the place I ran a mile. It is dirty, unloved and looks like there has been no work done since it was convemed froma tented camp about 5 years ago. Adobe huts with straw roof, and concrete and corrugated tin out the back for toilet and shower. When I saw the size of the spider wandering across the floor I knew my wife would never stay there. All the hotels in Mu siyari have a great view there's nothing special about the view from here.",A Tripadvisor Member,/Profile/null,"Sydney, Australia",10
pithoragarh,"Great view of the Panchachuli range. Housekeeping is below par, so be prepared for insects and musty linen. Food is good and a reasonably wide selection considering how remote Munsyari is.",c_gangs,/Profile/c_gangs,"Pune, India",40
pithoragarh,"Wayfarer resort - quite an ok place to stay. The facilities need a bit looking after and gives a look as if the owners dont much care about the place. But the staff puts up a very good show. They are very friendly and servce is extremely prompt. They will also happily light up a bonfire for you in the night, which is absolutely awesome in the cold. The view of the snow capped mountains...the Panchachuli range is absolutely breathtaking. There are also a good no of trekking trails if you like to go trekking. Make sure you carry cash though...Munsuyari town has no ATMs and I doubt any place accepts credit cards.",Siddharth G,/Profile/siddsg,"Pune, India",30
pithoragarh,"I would compare the idea of coming here with the memory of running naked laughing, as a child. so pretty much one can forget the technology and the mental build ups and just be, almost as if you may never know till when this place lasts....  Those you get what has been written above, would be compelled to find out more on their own.  And those who didnt, its ok.  Thumbs up to the place for sure. Should plan for at least a 4 nights overall trip to manage the travel and stay in between as from Kathgodam station the place is 13 hours car journey. Many nice places nearby to see.",siddharth_khanna,/Profile/siddharth_khanna,"New Delhi, India",50
pithoragarh,I visited Munsiyari in April and had booked my accomodation in the resort from Delhi itself. As a part of my research on accomodation I felt that there was not any other place I would want to stay at other than Wayfarer and was so happy to have stuck to my decision as the resort totally lived up to my expectation and even beyond! When we reached the resort at night it was absolutely quaint and silent with the pet dogs in the resort greeting us along with the friendly staff. But it was the morning after which completly blew our mind. From the window of our room we see the sun rising above totally white snow clad mountains. The view couldnt have been better from any other place.  We visited the resort the day India won the world cup and it couldnt have been better than seeing it,Rashi_Travel,/Profile/Rashi_Travel,New Delhi,50
