Initially we were having a good impression about their location and staff etc. But later we faced lot of challenges which made our stay miserable. Couple of junior folks were helpful and hospitable, but rest were unfriendly. We found that the hotel management is completely inhuman with our drivers, not providing them any accommodation even though at cost, food was charged at exorbitant rate compared to other places, even not allowing them to use toilet !!! We stayed there for 3 nights and on last night they even served one third quantity of main dish and quite a few of our group had to survive on dal chawal, which were shameful for some of us who were managing the entire trip.

pithoragarh,the one positive point about this property is the location and the view. its just short of messy Munsyari and every room has a view of the The Panchchuli. The staff is helpful and polite. And that's where the good part ends. The so called luxury room was sort of basic.  Way too many house flies enter the room the moment you open the door and one is literally left swatting them the time one is inside the room. Another wing is under construction which would add to the number of rooms available. The food is a mixed bag and inconsistent. Except the vegetarian noodles (ask them to make it with less oil and no cabbage) don't recall anything worthwhile.,AlpineKorps,/Profile/AlpineKorps,,30

About Munsiyari: While there are a few more hotels in Munsiyari, Milam Inn would be the one you would choose to stay. There's nothing much in terms of town and market but there are quite a few glaciers and treks that backpackers would love.
