pithoragarh,"The hotel itself is quite average. The main three-storeyed building is located towards the mountain side of the parking area, lawn, and garden, on the other side of which there are 4 standalone cottages. We stayed in a cottage, which had a small side room with an extra bed. The bathroom was spacious and clean. However, the one thing that we missed the most was room heating, and the TV service was also below par. There were a few power cuts as well which I guess should not be unexpected at such a remote place, and there was no power back up. Another issue that needs to be addressed by the hotel management is the difficulty in locking the doors; the locks require either replacement or proper alignment. A backdoor in the side room leads to the platform at the back of the cottages,",A S,/Profile/anirbansm,,40
