pithoragarh,"Hotel Bala Paradise has a good clear view of the Panchchuli range from the room. Rooms are clean and comfortable with a geyser in the bathroom which is a must in the region. Their service is good and staff is courteous. It is located slightly downwards from where the car can drop you hence may not be very comfortable for senior citizens if they have problems like joint pains. Otherwise the location of the hotel is best in terms of its close proximity to the market area and not very far from the major tourist locations. We enjoyed our stay here, thanks to the staff and would recommend this hotel.",Sunita P,/Profile/SKJP_1982,"Mumbai, India",40
pithoragarh,At the zeroth milestone of munsiyari. Parking not a big issue. Restaurant in contract. But food was good. In room service was good.  Room quality was just above average. A halipad nearby.  Best part is the rooftop. Sit and enjoy panchachuli on a clear day.,khushal sharma,/Profile/khushalsharma,"Jaipur, India",40
pithoragarh,"To start, i had my booking done 1 months back. On reaching the hotel they say rooms we had booked not available. We had to wit for nearly 2 hours to settle down for a room lower the category and view. And i could sense after staying at hotel, we were not the only ones suffering, many more were there all complaining and shouting. I still keptcalm and accepted what was available since i did not want my whole tour to get compromised because of that.  Mountain facing rooms on higher floor have amazing view of the Panchchuli peaks. Since we did not have correct rooms so we sought the terrace for the same and it was an amazing sunrise to view.  Staff at the reception is otherwise cooperative but probably internally mismanaged.  The overall stay was also also disturbed due to the",AnkurModi26,/Profile/AnkurModi26,"Kolkata, India",30
pithoragarh,"Hotel Bala Paradise is located about 200 meters away from the Bus Station and is an okay place for stay at Munsiyari at the given tariff.  They have a restaurant where we had dinner, which was just fine.",RAJENDRA884 PRASAD,/Profile/GuruGhummakad,"Faridabad, India",30
pithoragarh,"We reached the hotel during evening and i can see the hotel in 50 mtr but no way of the car, so i called one of the staff whr is the parking, they said thr is no parking just park on the road. This was a first shock to me. How can a hotel be ranked 1 and have these basic issues and no one highlighted it.   We entered the room, room was good with new modern amenities. We ordered dinner, we were hungry and ate food like anything. Negative was it was oily. The menu says that kitchen is opened till 11, we ordered milk for kids and tea for us at 10:20, they denied it and their reply (guy in the green tshirt in the kitchen) was ""ye to dinner ka time hai.. dinner kar lo"". I went down to kitchen and he gave the same reply. Then after a heated discussion they said ok we are sending and",Sunny2401,/Profile/Sunny2401,"New Delhi, India",10
pithoragarh,Its simply Value for money. I think this is best hotel in the vicinity. Newly built few rooms and hotel is clean enough to have decent stay.I will suggest to go for this hotel without even thinking again. Choose the room with Panch-chula peaks view.,tg802018,/Profile/tg802018,"New Delhi, India",40

pithoragarh,"This place is centrally located.We went there without booking and found this room on the fourth floor. It was 4pm in the evening and raining when we reached. We didn't find out what a gem of a room it was until the sun came out and with the sunshine the entire panchachulli range became visible clearly from the window.And what an experience it was!would cherish that through out lifetime. Besides the view, rooms , room service and food were also excellent. Overall enjoyed our two day stay here.",Chaity C,/Profile/chaityc2017,,40
pithoragarh,The hotel is in the middle of town & Panchachuli Peak is visible from the hotel room. Rooms are nice & newly furnished having all essential amenities. The manager was very nice & kind. This place is good with a peaceful get-away. The hotel does not have parking that's the only minus point.,Astha Jain,/Profile/NewfangledGirl,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
pithoragarh,"Centrally located in town.Awesome view of Panchachulli group, provided you get a clear day.Nice rooms.Would be better if you get north facing rooms you won't need to get out of your bed to see the moutains at sunrise.Only one problem no car parking available.Other than this no shortcomings.",Dipanjan B,/Profile/DipanjanB39,,40
pithoragarh,Decent hotel with nice newly furnished rooms. Location is not a big plus since this is right in the center of the hustle bustle of the town. Not the place if one is looking for a peaceful get-away. On one day almost got into an argument with folks of a really loud group who had checked into the hotel. Hotel staff did nothing to quieten them for convenience of other guests.   Also the hotel does not have parking.  Food was good. Mr. Bisht tries to take personal care of all the guest's choices.,Rahulpar2014,/Profile/Rahulpar2014,"New Delhi, India",30
pithoragarh,The newly built hotel has started operation recently. This is located in the centre of the town. The rooms size is average with good ambience. Himalayan peaks are visible on a clear day from the rooms. The reasonably priced food had good taste. Our request for local was easily accepted. Room with breakfast for Rs.1500- was really a good bargain and best in the town.  Negatives: Hotel does not have open areas and approach is not good. The management assured us that it will be improved in near future.,Singhee A,/Profile/asinghee,jaipur,40
