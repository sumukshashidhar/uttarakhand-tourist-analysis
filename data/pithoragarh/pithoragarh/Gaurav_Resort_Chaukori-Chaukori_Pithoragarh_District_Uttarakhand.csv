pithoragarh,I traveled solo to Chaukori in the early part of June. I found the hotel to be clean and good. The hotel is located in an out of the way area although there are a few hotels next to it. Overall the place is quiet and peaceful. The view from the balcony is quite astounding. Rooms were decently priced. They are a little more expensive in the season apparently but off season may get you cheaper prices. The hotel is based on four floors and the stairs are steep. It might be exhausting for the elderly or the unaccustomed to negotiate them. However the rooms themselves are modestly sized but not cramped. The washroom was clean and there was hot water available. The best part of this hotel is the presence of nets on the windows which doesnt allow the creepy crawlies to enter at night,Uday R,/Profile/494udayr,"Mumbai, India",40

pithoragarh,"We booked the hotel 2 month in advanced to get best rooms,but when we checked in we were provided with lower room, when we asked the owner Mr Balwant for top floor he refused to provide the same and told us it was booked earlier than us,but the same time another tourist came without early booking and he provided the top floor rooms to them on less price than us,then issue of food  we ask about the meal they have limited menu worst cooking, very less staff to provide any service,rooms are good, big toilets and good location,rude owner not to stay again here.

pithoragarh,"Rooms are poorly maintained. TVs in the rooms are of Adam age. Most of the rooms are having damp. Staff members are very rude, drunken and uncivilized. They do not want to serve well to the guests and do not possess proper knowledge of how to behave with guests.",sandybose,/Profile/sandybose,"Kolkata, India",20
