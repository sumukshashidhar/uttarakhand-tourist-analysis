pithoragarh,"I visited Munsyari last week. I stayed here for 2 days. Though it was not advised to visit Munsyari during Monsoon (July-August) but I still I went there because I was sucked my extreme hot temperature of my city. It was fog all around in Munsyari when we visited. We were waiting from dawn to dusk for just a sight of Panchachuli Hills. Finally in the evening, the the fog gradually reduced and a crystal clear view of mesmerizing Panchachuli Hills was visible from our hotels room. Regarding hotel and staff, I would say that it was a homely experience. It was a perfect room facing Panchachuli hills. Staff was much friendly so was the owner Mr. Pandey. He acting as a guide took us to Nanda Devi temple in his personal car. The food was also good, specially the 'Jeera Aalu' was tasty.",VijaySmitha,/Profile/VijaySmitha,"Malappuram, India",50
pithoragarh,I booked this hotel from my tour operator on the basis of its advertisements. the location is nice - you would be able to view panchachulli range and glacier from your bed. but the rooms lack maintenance. the lamp shades were broken with most of the swiches not in usable condition. the carpet was full of dirt. linens were used and pathetic. bathrooms are odorous with broken fittings. geyser was not working properly. utensils were very dirty. food was very costly with not up to the mark to charge such a high price. service was dismal with no room service at all. absence of purified water sources.  do not expect valet parking.,sugataIndia,/Profile/sugataIndia,india,30
