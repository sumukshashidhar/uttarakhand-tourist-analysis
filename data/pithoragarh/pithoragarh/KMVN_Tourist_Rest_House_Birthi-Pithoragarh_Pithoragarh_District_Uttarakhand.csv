pithoragarh,"As is in other places, the KMVN has picked the best spot to view Birthi in a reclusive mood! Besides the hospitality of KMVN, the other 24 hours x7x365 days service available here is the tranquility of Himalayas with all its grandeurs. ",sganguly360,/Profile/sganguly360,"Kolkata, India",50
pithoragarh,"I booked this TRH after going through various reviews on tripadvisor and after speaking to its Manager, Mr. Kedar. He helped us in arranging a guide for trekking to Khaliya Top.  Pros: 1. The location is excellent, just opposite to Birthi falls, about one hour (35 km) before Munsiyari town. 2. Rooms are clean, airy and have TV, cozy bed and linens. 3. Washrooms have geyser and western style commode. 4. They have in house kitchen and food is delicious, just order a bit in advance as they prepare fresh, so it takes time. 5. They have ample parking for cars. 6. We did not face electricity crisis at all. 7. First floor rooms have waterfall view from attached balcony. 8. They do not have a bar,  but  one can bring his own alcohol and have it in rooms. 9. Very reasonably priced rooms.",gauravkhattar,/Profile/gauravkhattar,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
pithoragarh,"Choose to stay in Birthi falls instead of Munsyari. Very good Hotel with Clean rooms, Good food and superb staff. It is located right on the highway overlooking the beautiful Birthi Falls. The rooms on the 1st floor have the Waterfall view which is superb. Nice place to stay to or from Munsyari.",Krishnan Swaminathan,/Profile/KrishnanS423,"Mumbai, India",50

pithoragarh,"So it was day 4….we were heading towards the high altitude zone of Kumaon belt,i.e,Munshiyari.We have already reviewed KMVN Mohan and Kausani   some days back. Prior to our trip,let me have some prelude to this booking of KMVN Birthi.Normally every one books KMVN Munshiyari and enroute Birthi.However I was FORTUNATE enough for not getting booking in Munshiyari KMVN as it was fully booked.So I had no other option but to book Birthi which was around 35/40 km ahead of Munshiyari.My plan was to go straight to Munshiyari from Kaushani , have some sight seeing and finally came down to Birthi for a night stay.But Mother Nature had some different plan.it was a lovely tour towards Birthi enrooting Bageswar ,Baijnath temple.Birthi is a small village with a very massive fountain.The KMVN",splendid_01,/Profile/splendid_01,"Kolkata, India",50

Staff is friendly and the place is quiet  ..better to book hotel in advance as the rooms are limited ...kmvn website is there for online bookings,soultraveler,/Profile/soultraveler678,"Gwalior, India",50
pithoragarh,"The KMVN guest house at Birthi Falls is right next to the falls and the only hotel/guest house we could see.  Birthi is a tiny village on the way up to Munsiyari which is made famous by the small yet very picturesque water fall. The property is quite lovely and economical. The rooms are on the smaller side but clean and well maintained. The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms on the lower floor are a 100 rupees cheaper since they don't have a direct view of the falls. The rooms on the 1st floor have a balcony and a view of the falls. Not all KMVNs allow pets, but the caretaker here said they were okay to have our dog stay in the room with us. There is not much to do here except the water falls, so this is ideal if you want to just ""get away from it all"" or stay for a night",YBNormal78,/Profile/YBNormal78,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
pithoragarh,"Birthi is a peaceful hamlet right before the Munsiyari Hill Station, in Pitoragarh district of uttrakhand. There is a beautiful waterfall in the vicinity and one can see that right from the room itself. Also one may treck little up hill to the base of the falls for better photographs, KMVN is the only accomodation available in Birthi.  View of the 125 meter fall from the property is very awesome.",SoloIndianTraveller,/Profile/SoloIndianTraveller,"New Delhi, India",40

pithoragarh,"We were on our way to Munsiyari, when there was sudden snowfall on the road and we got stuck and had to go back to Birthi KMVN. We reached there at around 8.30 pm (which can be quite late for dinner during off-season at Kumaon hotels), but the staff and manager extended all there help in making us feel welcome after spending few hours stuck in snow. Food was really good, and hotel was clean and maintained well. Although the location may not be as famous due to Munsiyari being only 30 kms away, if you are getting late, this is not a bad hotel to stay before going to Munsiyari the next morning.",VJ81,/Profile/VJ81,Gurgaon,40
pithoragarh,"35 km from Munsiyari, KMVN TRH, Birthi is located on Munsiyari-Thal Road near the mighty Birthi Falls. It was in fact a great experience for us staying at this wonderful TRH with wonderful hotel staff who really made us feel at home with their friendly and affable behaviour. The only problem that we faced was during power cuts at night as there was no generator back up for power failure. The food menu for lunch or dinner had limited options to choose from but the food we were served was of very good quality. I really enjoyed the breakfast there. So far as I remember we had puri sabji for breakfast. It was really delicious. We received very good treatment from the hotel staff. We stayed in executive rooms whose balconies overlook the mighty and beautiful Birthi Falls. There is a",BIBEK B,/Profile/Bibek12,"Kolkata, India",50
