pithoragarh,After a tiring journey this for our stay. Close to the market with heavy traffic this hotel comes on right side. The rooms are nice. Staff is good and the food is good too. Nepal is just a bridge away and one can take a small walk from there till there eat something and come back. ,Aakash K,/Profile/AakashK190,"New Delhi, India",50
pithoragarh,"Neat and clean rooms, typical of KMVN properties across. Its right in the heart of Dharchula town and you have to drive through extremely crowded roads(one way, thankfully) and then you enter this gated property on your right.  Located right on Kali river, you can admire Nepal just across the river and even take a small walk after crossing the bridge. However,the parking can be organised better.",Aditya A,/Profile/CottageNirvana,"Mukteshwar, India",40
pithoragarh,"Out of all the places except NHPC guest house which is meant only for NHPC guests, this is the best place to stay in Dharchula because of two -three reasons: Food is always there as staff maintains basic items. Staff is co-operative. Location is just near to bus stop . Area of improvement can be : cleanliness and more professional touch in services",lux,/Profile/luxtraveller987,"Hyderabad, India",30
pithoragarh,"Hello. This is a Government rest house on the banks of Kaali river and a very good option to stay in Dharchula. This place is known as Gateway to Kailash Mansarovar Yatra and Adi Kailash Yatra, one of famous religious pilgrimages. The staff people are very kind, always supportive, rooms are very clean and available at economical rates with basic amenities. Also there are many places to explore like Indo- Nepal Border is just a stone through from the KMVN guest house, Darma Valley, Panchachuli Base, Munsiyari and many more. A highly recommended place to stay with friends and family. 5⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",Ashish Rawat,/Profile/himalayan_son,"New Delhi, India",50
pithoragarh,"Manas is the name of this Tourist Rest House, developed by Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam, a Govt sponsored organisation.  The rest house is located bang on the river Kali and one can have clear view of Darchula, which is in Nepal, on the other side.  Rooms were big but need maintenance.",RAJENDRA884 PRASAD,/Profile/GuruGhummakad,"Faridabad, India",30
pithoragarh,"One of the few places in India from where you can literally walk into a foreign land i.e. Nepal. The Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam or KMVN as it is usually known, is strategically located along the Sarda river. I visited the place in the month of March, 2017 (not 2018). In the midst of local shops and market, there is a foot over bridge which takes you straight into Nepal, no paperwork required. Albeit, you may asked me to produce a photo identity card by BSF personnel. Upon entry, I was delighted to find out that bars in our neighbour country open up quite early. You may find local brands of beer with few familiar names. All in all, a beautiful and serene place.  ",Pranav Sarthi,/Profile/788pranavs,,40

pithoragarh,"With pretty big Rooms the Hotel is located in the middle of the market, okay for Trekkers who will be spending maximum a day or two, please keep in mind of two problems before visiting this place, altitude of Dharchula is not very high, we had to put on Fans in the month of May, load shedding is a frequent problem and added to this is Mosquito, so please take enough precaution for Mosquitoes",Anirban,/Profile/Anirban0302,"Kolkata, India",30
pithoragarh,"For the Uthrakhand based ancient trek route for Kailash Manasarovar, Dharchula is a key town. Here the mini buses stop and you will take 4 WDs till Narayan Ashram onwy or from Mangti Nalla return. Esply on the way back, the resort was luxurios and we could relax and rest. Comfy rooms, nice view esplecially of roaroing River Kali - a constant companion for entire yaathra route. There are shops at the entrance and near-by. General stores that serve many things that you have not seen for days during yaathra - ( Buttermilk / Yoghurt  Dahi or even bread/Jam for instance).... Thanks to KMVN. Neat place, good food. Friendly people. Jump across the bridge to Nepal. We went up to the Nepal Darchula bus stand",Jawz1964,/Profile/Jawz1964,"Bengaluru, India",40
pithoragarh,"We stayed for a night at KMVN TRH Dharchula. The scenic beauty of the place was good but the KMVN rooms were very unclean, damp and outlandish. The view from the hotel balcony was good. The Kali river and Nepal border were at stone throw distance from the hotel. One can easily cross the Nepal border on foot and so what we did. Food was not available some how at dinner. However the stay at KMVN is not suggested at Dharchula. Better options available near the market place.",RBan26,/Profile/RBan26,"Bengaluru, India",20
