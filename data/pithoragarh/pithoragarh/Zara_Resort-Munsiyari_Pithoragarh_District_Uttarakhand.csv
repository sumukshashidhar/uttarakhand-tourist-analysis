pithoragarh,"Had stayed at this property for 3 nights during my visit to Munsiyari in May 2013. It's an old property, a little dated but the property is ok. What makes up for the dated property is the staff. They are really helpful and very courteous. Considering Munsiyari is a small place there are very few options to eat, the fare served at the hotel is simple and delicious. When you are in Munsiyari don't forget to taste the potatoes grown locally. They are truly delicious. With a little upkeep this property will do well.

pithoragarh,Nestled in this hilly region and full of snow all around this was a great place for all lovers of hills and that was a good enough reason for us to be there  Food is decent but not great but the overall experience is definitely good.,mihikaraaj,/Profile/mihikaraaj,"Mumbai, India",40
pithoragarh,Snow Capped Peaks Of Pancha Chulli looks mesmerising during Sunrise. Chilly winter morning relivs U with Golden Yellow colord snowy peaks infront of U as if U can touch then. Road to Munsiyari with snow around gives U a feel as if U r in Switzerland of India. For trekkers its a paradise. U feel like coming here time n again. Cant xpres all in words as its so pictrsque. Food may not b veey flashy but basics. U may love to hv local food too.,deep90gupta,/Profile/deep90gupta,"Kolkata, India",50
pithoragarh,"This is a small resort , well the only one other being run by the government. Firstly let's make only thing clear this is a very far away place and only for nature lovers, if u are looking for luxury ..sorry wrong place. I have been here twice .The staff was always very helpful ..I stll remember the hot maggi they made for me late at night or freshly baked bread in the morning. I had gone tracking to patni top and the staff did their best to help..hey even tracked along with me and made delicious parathas for the way. The view of the stars from the roof is just awesome at night ...wow , feels like one can touch the stars , actually I had my drinks on the roof top every night with nice hot pakoras from the kitchen. Lol .. I got a deluxe room .with a old black and white TV ..and",I_sharad,/Profile/I_sharad,"New Delhi, India",30
pithoragarh,"We reached Munsiyari after a long days drive from Pithoragarh. It was almost dusk & we missed out on checking the Kumaon Mandal run Hotel & instead drove straight to Zara Resort as the Wayfarer Resort on the way was best left by the way.  Although the Hotel was empty (at this time of the year, they usually are), the manager was adamant that he would not give us more then 40% discount on the rack rates but as we were tired, we just checked in. Only ONE room in the entire hotel has a view of the magnificent Panchchuli mountains. We occupy 3 rooms & suddenly the hotel occupancy shoots up from zero to 30%!!!  The manager instructs the skeletal staff to turn on the boiler so that we may get some hot water for a much needed shower. One hour & tons of buckets of cold water later, some",bombaytraveller,/Profile/bombaytraveller,"Mumbai, India",10
pithoragarh,"The hotel is a real dump but it was a place to sleep -- albeit in my clothes and travel sheet. For those who have been trekking for a week or more it must seem like a comfortable place to arrive at -- and you have your sleeping bag. The food was decent, the view was nice, there were photo ops from the roof. The town of Munsyari is some distance away so there are no shops nearby for purchases. The views to and from Munsyari are as spectacular as any in the Himalayan foothills.",Paul K,/Profile/go2places,California,20
