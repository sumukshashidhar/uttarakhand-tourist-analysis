pithoragarh,"Got introduced to this wonderful group through a colleague 's reference and I am so glad about it. Just back after a 6 day trek and camp , that too SOLO, and it just could not have been better. The team leader , Mr Kamal, is a thorough professional and cares for your safety and comfort beyond perfection.My other team nembers, Mr Lali, the chef, and Mr Bablu, the man behind the wheels, are real gems. Not do they just do their part with full commitment,  in the extremes of weather and circumstances,  they also do every bit to make that special by giving that extra personal touch. It felt like being with a part of your family. We covered the mesmerizing Daankudi,  the dreamy Camp Shaama , the magnificent Namik valley and the serene Ramganga, where I could meet the tech guy, Mr",Fatima,/Profile/Solodreamytraveller,,50
pithoragarh,"If you want to relax amongst the mountains but also have an adventure filled time this is the place you need to go to. The campsite is ideal for large groups, families, couples or solo travellers. It’s set in an idyllic location along the beautiful Ramganga river and comes with its own white sand beach. Getting to the campsite is a slightly long drive, about 8-9 hours from Kathgodam, but nothing comes easy in life, does it? Once you get to the campsite you will forget the journey and want to at once go take a dip in the cold refreshing waters of the river. The campsite in itself is basic but with all the required amenities of western toilets and tented baths. There’s a designated dining area and some beach loungers put out to enjoy the lovely views and weather. There’s no",Vrushali Gulwadi,/Profile/Vrush_g,,50
pithoragarh,Wildrift at Riveredge Ramganga is just the perfect getaway destination and worth the effort to reach the camp. From water adventure sports to volleyball to nature walk to doing nothing...all is in the offering. Three or four night stay is recommended for the total experience.,Tushar Parikh,/Profile/Prisha2412,,50
pithoragarh,"This camp is ideal for those who just want to enjoy good swims, canoeing and rafting etc. Experts are available.  They should improve the quality of big tents. Family accommodation becomes a task if the tent is shoddy.  Early morning tea is served quite late. The whole idea of tenting is that one gets up early, goes for a walk or a quick swim and gets his hot tea or coffee ready... Waiting for him.  So much can be done to improve the setting. But I believe after the 2013 Kedarnath tragedy, Ramganga and adjoining areas, resorts have never properly recuperated.  A 6/10 experience.",Sunanda B,/Profile/Tina_tube,"New Delhi, India",30
pithoragarh,"For all the nature lovers camping at Ramganga river with Wildrift is highly recommended. As a location it is excellent, which you can make out from the various pictures also but I would specially like to talk about the overall experience with Wildrift. We were a group of 13 people including teenagers, kids aging 7-8 years. Right from the itinerary planning to keeping the group engaged, helping us in trekking/water activities, arranging group games, playing with small kids....it was a totally personalized vacation crafted for our group. The young boys working with Wildrift are truly multi-talented and happy souls. In the day time they help the guests with adventure activities taking special care of the young trekkers, evenings they actively play with the groups and during nights",Vibhuti,/Profile/Natureloverparent,,50
pithoragarh,"It was an amazing experience...If someone wants a break from the city life and enjoy nature, this is the place to be. All the activities here are amazing and very safe as well. The food is amazing and apart from all this the people here at the camp are amazing, very friendly and helpful. OVERALL an amazing experience worth every penny and highly recommend coming to this place",DrZainab K,/Profile/DrZainabK1,,50
pithoragarh,"view: surrounded by mountains from all fours; next to river ramganga. it's a private beach. crystal clear green waters; clear weather; zillion stars at night.  stay: riverside camps with mattresses and sleeping bags; will keep you warm; comfortable; kinda rugged experience-not for luxury savvy. western toilets and bath.  activities: trekking round the clock through dense forest; you may sight leopard, bear, wild boars, wild chicks, etc; kayaking-amazing shallow waters-you can go deep if you want; the instructor is very good and friendly; bridge slithering- drift down the bridge slowly ending in short drop into water; cycling- good geared bikes through ups and downs-difficulty-moderate. bonfire round the clock with tea and snacks.   all activities aforesaid can be adjusted to",advharsh10,/Profile/advharsh10,"New Delhi, India",40
pithoragarh,"If you are in love with mountains and sea as well then this is the best place to be. The beautiful beach will hold you with mountain cold breeze and of course the river, 'Ramganga'. One can sit on the beach for hours feeling the sand and even sitting on the thatch with a warm cup of tea, it's a bliss. The camp is so beautifully designed in Harmony with nature yet keeping its rawness and wilderness alive which makes it a perfect hideout away from city and crowd. Though river is never silent, gushing sound of river in silent night, even watching pitch dark night sky which is always full of stars and waking up early morning with the chirping of birds is a different kind of experience. There is so much here to connect with, be it surrounding, nature or with own self. You get ample",komal r,/Profile/komalr150,,50
pithoragarh,Had a very nice and enjoyable stay with my wife and friends. The guys were very helpful and accommodating. The food was simple and sumptuous.  The cat was over friendly.  The activities were fun.  Tips: The night sky deserves a special mention. Do spend some time watching the stars. Go for the bike ride. the bikes are not in top notch condition but the ride is awesome. Go fishing. You may not catch anything but its fun. Slithering and kayaking is a must. If its not too cold jump in the river. Take your own toiletries. Don't expect a hotel treatment/facilities. If you need something. Ask the guys anytime. Reaching there might take some time. But its worth the effort.,mfdilawar,/Profile/mfdilawar,"New Delhi, India",50
pithoragarh,"Camping by the river and stargazing on a chilly night near a bonfire(again by the river) are just a few of the other awesome things one can do here. The river is crystal clear, and kayaking with Nanu sir would be one of the best things to do if you plan to visit. Swimming and cliff jumping is another add-on to the whole fun experience. The team on-site will treat you like family, and you will be lucky to befriend such beautifully souled people and know about their culture and practices.  Staying here makes you feel one with nature, and the dogs Sandy and Rocco will keep you occupied in case you are bored with kayaking and trekking around the area! The food and stay are of top quality. I look forward to going here again and I would recommend Wildrift to anyone who plans to visit",SanaayaKurup,/Profile/SanaayaKurup,"Pune, India",50
pithoragarh,"We were two families with 4 young children - aged 5 to 13. We stopped at Ramganga after our trek to Namik and Bajemania.   Tents are basic, sleep on the ground in sleeping bags; loos are basic and clean. The hut is the only place where there are cots. No electricity, and airtel doesn't work in most of Kumaon. So you are basically just with the nature which we enjoyed. Of course, as with any nature camp, you can expect insects, worms and spiders as part of the package. We spotted a lot of jugnu's (fireflies) in the night - something possible only without electricity.   We did the normal activities offered there - kayaking, slithering, cliff dives, swimming in the river. The river is the best part of the camp. Kids loved making mud castles out of the sand after the slithering",fun_with_kids_2,/Profile/fun_with_kids_2,Delhi,50
pithoragarh,"Amazing doesn't even begin to describe the experience I had here. If peace and tranquility, a beautiful river and greenery all around, warm and friendly people and a desire to get away from city life are what you're looking for, then this is the place to come to.  I stayed here for two days and probably lived more than I would in months!  We fished in the river and baked the fresh fish for dinner.  We went trekking over rocks and ridges, climbed a hill, and met some lovely local folks too.  Jumped off a bridge (Slithering) and swam in the river. Did kayaking, that too in the company of a gorgeous dog!  Sat around the bonfire at night, talking, listening to local songs, with the sound of the river around us.  Must mention, from the tents to the loos to the kitchen, everything",Udita P,/Profile/uditap2017,,50
pithoragarh,"One of the best set up of all camps with all basic amenities as its on river side. Be an adventurous person to experience Kayaki, bridge jumping and for swimmers its wonderful experience to swim in nature's lap surrounded by valley. Bonfire and river sound sound in late night gives you feel how close you are to nature . I will strongly recommend if you want to experience something different with safety concerns, Wildrift Adventure is the right team you should experience and more then visitor they treat you like their own family member and take cares at their best. Mr. Manoj and their entire Team ie Dinesh, Soniya, Narender are the amazing person to explore these area's .",Neeraj B,/Profile/NeerajB311,,50
pithoragarh,"Had an amazing time at this camp, stayed there twice last year. Very child friendly with lots of activities like slithering, kayaking, cycling, short treks to keep the kids well engaged. Wonderful camp coordinators, they really enhance your experience with a local touch. All the camp bhaiyas are very friendly and very helpful. Had great fun in everything, be it watching the stars and trying to identify the constellations at night or looking for different birds during the trek. The bonfire by the riverside was the icing on the cake :)....my daughter cant wait to get back again. Food is good, they try and serve some local pahadi dishes too, the tents are comfortable if you are not looking for luxury, phone connectivity is not an issue at most places in the camp, loos are clean and",Shilpi D,/Profile/ShilpiD16,,50
pithoragarh,"One of the most serene and beautiful camp sites in the region.  Amazing camp coordinators make the experience even better.  Must visit if you are in the Kumaon region.   Overall 5 stars for location, food, staff and facilities ",rutveekk,/Profile/rutveekk,,50
pithoragarh,"Pros 1. Lots of activities - slithering (almost bungee from the bridge), River crossing , Kayaking, Volleyball, Cycling (best of the lot) 2. Helpful staff - One of the most courteous and helpful staff I have come across 3. Great food - Okay it's not finger licking good but great by hill station standards. Hygienic too.  4. Camps are reasonably large and comfortable and well maintained. Loo facilities are pretty decent for a camp  Cons 1. Insects at night - Not a problem with the place but there are several insects which get attracted to the light at night as its pitch dark. I had several insect bites and despite an ointment. No help virtually from the staff - they seem unaffected| 2. No telephone signal - Which can be a boon or a bane. Additonally no place to charge the phone so",PuneetSaxena,/Profile/PuneetSaxena,mumbai,50
pithoragarh,"This is one of the best places I have lived in. Beautiful river, local food and the best people. i recommend everyone to visit this place once in life. It is for everyone. You can enjoy kayaking, bird watching, local village tour and lot more fun.",Manohar_Mehra,/Profile/Manohar_Mehra,"Rishikesh, India",50
