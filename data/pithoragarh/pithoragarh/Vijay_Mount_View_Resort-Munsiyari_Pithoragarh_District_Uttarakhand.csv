Luxurious, so a bit costly, but value for money. very good view from the rooms and balcony. we stayed there for two nights, 11th and 12th November, 2019. It was a full moon night, so even in the darkness, we can see the Panchachulli range from our room. the only problem is the staff, who are quite moody in nature and try to impose their decision on you. But you just need to make them understand who the boss is.

pithoragarh,"The location of the hotel is good, its about a couple of km before the city. If you keep apart the power house which is right in front the view is very good. We were fortunate enough to have a glimpse of the snow clad peaks as it rained just before our arrival and in the clear weather we could spot a few peaks. Rest of the time the weather was unclear so no view at all. The climate was cool and that made our visit great.  They have great rooms, I had one luxury family suite (very spacious and nice), one super deluxe room (one at GF with garden in front and it was also spacious) and one valley facing deluxe room which was also excellent in terms of space, ambiance and facilities. Highly satisfied with the rooms, neat clean and good service. Great value for money.  To speak of",OpinionsofAshish,/Profile/OpinionsofAshish,"Agra, India",40
pithoragarh,"Stayed at this hotel along with my family (3 members total) at the end of May 2014 for 3 nights.  The USP of this place are : 1) all its front facing rooms have a great view of the Panchachuli peaks (on a clear day ofcourse!);  2) just on the outskirts of Munsiyari town...so away from the hustle-bustle; 3) ample parking space and garage for your vehicle (if driving); 4) neat, clean, big rooms with all amenities in working condition....being a relatively new hotel. The back facing rooms are its drawback ofcourse (no view of anything, except the corridor) and corridor has no sound-proofing....so God help you if the other guests happen to be raucous group of travellers from a certain state from the West or East of India!!  Otherwise, no complaints about the hotel. We spent one",gups18,/Profile/gups18,"New Delhi, India",40

The Snow Clad Pancha Chuli view just opposite to the hotel can be enjoyed from the balcony or even from within the rooms as all the front view is covered up with clear glass.  Food being served in the dining hall and on request at rooms is homely and tasty.  The staff are friendly and co-operative.   One of my friends was suffering from nausea and vomitting.

pithoragarh,First of all I want to make it clear it is not a resort but a budget hotel. We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights of 23-24-25 March 2014. Had received 2-3 calls from Mr Pangtey after I booked this hotel so was expecting a good stay in this hotel. But the attitude of the Manager Mr Prakash Joshi belied my expectations. No housekeeping or room cleaning was done during our entire stay of 3 nights. The food quality and choice left much to be desired. As we had taken MAP package which also included evening tea and snacks. Evening snacks were given only on first day inspite of reminding to Mr Prakash Joshi. The Heaters and Geysers don't work in this hotel as there are frequent power cuts in Munsiyari. The last night was spent without any heater inspite of freezing cold.

pithoragarh,"We stayed in Vijay Mount View resort for 2 nights (Dec 26, 27 - 2013) during our Nainital-Munsiyari-Chaukori trip. All the rooms in this hotel offers excellent views of Panchachuli peak. The lawn in front of the hotel is a perfect spot to get breathtaking pics of Panchachuli peak and the layers of green valleys and hills underneath. The experience of sunrise from this hotel is a true bliss. We got 3 rooms on the ground floor which has easy access to the lawn in front. It is a real mesmerising experience when you open the window curtains at 6:30am and see the Panchachuli peak lit by the golden morning rays as near as if you can touch them. Hotel staff was very helpful and prompt at service. Food quality was just awesome.

pithoragarh,"What an awesome hotel!! Let me tell you my story & how I landed up there....We are a family of 5 adults and 1 child. We planned to stay in Munsiyari for 3 nights and needed two rooms. However, we got booking in KMVN only for two nights for two rooms and rest one night for one room only. Thinking, the third day will really be cramped with 5A+1C in room, I was looking for another hotel where we can move in for one night. I started looking over web and landed on this one. Their website has live videos and images of their rooms which looked breathtaking. So, I called up the contact listed in their website and Mr. Pangtey, the owner, picked up the phone. You won't believe, listening to my case, he offered me that if we move in for three nights, he will adjust the KMVN cancellation",Kanian_Chatterjee,/Profile/Kanian_Chatterjee,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",50
