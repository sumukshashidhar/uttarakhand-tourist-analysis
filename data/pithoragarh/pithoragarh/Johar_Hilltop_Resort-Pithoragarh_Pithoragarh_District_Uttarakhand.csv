pithoragarh,"Hotel had everything but lacking everything as well. Washrooms not good, delivery late, rooms were also average . Only good thing was itâ€™s location & open area they are having. Lots of space for kids to play & view of sunrise from balcony.",AshishVashist,/Profile/AshishVashist,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",30

pithoragarh,"This hotel is not suitable for families at all. Only backpackers can manage with it. Rooms are small, washrooms, kitchen, dinning places are extremely dirty. They unethically use a poor Nepali kid as hotel boy. Me and my wife booked it for 3 nights and moved to KMVN hotel just after staying one night. We booked through an online agent where pictures of other hotels are shown and he charged much more than actual tariff. Never go for online booking. Rooms in this hotel are always available  and are much cheaper than it shows online.  BEWARE OF THE FRAUD ONLINE AGENT.",das_nab,/Profile/das_nab,"Jaipur, India",10
