pithoragarh,"- Traveled with family in winter season.  - Booked a mountain facing room with balcony which had amazing views of the snow-clad Himalayas. One can enjoy sunrise & sunset from their own rooms / balconies. Just be careful of the monkeys that even come on balconies :-) so better to keep the balcony doors locked.  - Hotel provided a heater / blower in room.  - Toiletries were provided at this hotel.  - Staff was friendly & helpful.  - Dinner was included in my package - restaurant staff served hot & fresh food on our table (since the temperatures dropped between 7 - 2 degrees daily, they did not lay the buffet - instead served everyone hot food on tables). Good variety of dishes to choose from the daily menu : soup, salad, papad, rice, dal, chapati, paneer, vegetable, sweet dish -",Kaiz_sm,/Profile/Kaiz_sm,"Mumbai, India",40

pithoragarh,This hotel probably has the best views in Kausani. You can see Trishul and Nanda devi mountains right from your room. Get the upper floor rooms to see magnificent sunrise from your room itself. Rooms are large and spacious. The barhrooms were also large and clean. The furniture seems little old and could do with some upgrade.   We were total 20 people staying there and we had a great time.  I am cutting one star for the food. The breakfast and lunch dinner spread was really thin and was average tastewise. They could also do a better job in maintaining the games. Calls itself a resort but games were ill maintained and broken.,travel_heman,/Profile/travel_heman,,40

Their entire staff, right from front office to restaurant to housekeeping, all of them really won our hearts!   The location of the hotel is excellent and it offers some stunning views of the Lesser Himalayan Range. On a clear day you can see the Trishul & Nanda Devi Peaks right from your room while lazing in your bed or from your balcony in any of the well appointed rooms!   The rooms are spacious and clean.

pithoragarh,We stayed in this hotel only for 1 day i.e. 23rd June to 24th June 2018 and other than location there is nothing we liked about this property. We have booked two rooms i.e. luxury but if I have to talk about our experience across following factors was not all fulfilling and this hotel needs rethinking on how the stay and  experience can be made better. Kausani is a great place but if I have to recall over my experience this hotel has spoiled overall memories I would have liked to carry with me back home for Kausani  1) Bath room ( are very shady in appearance) 2) Hand towels ( very dirty ) 3) Cross Ventilation ( stuffy room) 4) Breakfast ( too oily food and need some good variety). 5) Warm welcome ( training is a must to the folks who are sitting in the reception area to welcome,ashujandial,/Profile/ashujandial,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",10

When visible the view of the snow clad mountains is spectacular offering a wide panaroma. The rooms have the basic amenities, but have the look of a budget accommodation. Rooms share a common balcony that overlook a garden and the hills and mountains beyond. There is a play area suitable for small children. My son had good fun playing there as also while playing frisbee in the garden. Food in the restaurant was average. Not bad but nothing special to call out either.

pithoragarh,"It is a nice property facing Himalayas with good food and supportive staff. Had an enjoyable stay at this hotel. Food is good, kids enjoyed the stay.

pithoragarh,"I stayed in this hotel with a group of around 80 people. This is one of the best places to stay in at Kausani. Located at  a very good point, it commands an amazing view of the himalayan snow peaks like Trishul, Nanda Ghunti, Nanda Devi and others.  The rooms are big and comfortable. The room service is also good. Most of the rooms commanded a very good view of the valley. It also had a large enough room for us to have a dance party. The food was good.  You can take nice walks around the hotel. The hotel people also arranged some nice rock climbing and rappeling activities. They also arranged a Pahadi dance show for us in the evening with a bonfire. They were kind enough to give us a morning wake-up call at 5 AM and we were able to witness a spectacular sunrise over the",Amol H,/Profile/herlekar,Bangalore,40

pithoragarh,"The location of the hotel is aptly called : View Point. The view of the Snow Peaks from our room verandah was SUPERB, to say the least. In fact we could watch the snow covered mountain range from our beds ! Imagine sipping a hot cup of tea/coffee and watching the Himalayas !! We had a very comfortable stay & enjoyed good food at the hotel restaurant.  The hotel & restaurant staff were very helpful & courteous.  Certainly worth a repeat visit.",Traveler-O-World,/Profile/Traveler-O-World,"Flagler Beach, Florida",50
pithoragarh,We booked rooms through MMT(Make My Trip). We (3 freinds with family) stayed for 3 nights and 4 days. The location is not far from the market and neither too near to disturb vacationers seeking quality time for relaxation. The rooms are spacious and facing the Himalayas. The Himalayan ranges and sunrise can be enjoyed from the rooms. The park offers got place for kids to play. One can enjoy a good leisure walk on either side of the hotel. The food is overall good though we had to request the staff for few items to be made better. Although the hotel website displays separate premium and luxury the management was smart to display only premium room charges in the peak season and market all rooms as premium.,Ymanoj,/Profile/Ymanoj,Vadodara,40
pithoragarh,"We were driving from Nainital to Kausani bypassing Ranikhet and as we distanced from nainital and approached Ranikhet the valley and the roads turned picturesque. By mistake we took one of the lessly used bypass to avoid the Ranikhet market road and though we were the only car in 3 hrs drive (little scary incase car develops problem as mobile signal was also not available), we enjoyed every second of the travel with the bounty of coniferous pines and violet-colored-flowering trees. The roads are no less challenging as far as the turns are concerned - a local solution helped for us. Carry sliced juicy lemon dipped in salt and suck  / lick it everytime you feel nauseating. It really works when Domstal and Avomin falied.  When we reached Kausani town, we were a little shaken as the",Antony_Firingee,/Profile/Antony_Firingee,Surat,40
