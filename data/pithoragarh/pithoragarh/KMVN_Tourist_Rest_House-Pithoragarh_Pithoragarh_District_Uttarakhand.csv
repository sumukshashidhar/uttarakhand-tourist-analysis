pithoragarh,"Hello Folks.  While returning from my Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, I got a chance to visit KMVN Tourist Rest House Pithoragarh. It is the easternmost district of Uttarakhand in north India, surrounded by Nepal to the east and Tibet to the north. This city is most popular for its exquisite natural serenity, pristine meadows and surrounded by mountains. One can spend quality time here, while experiencing the vitality of the city. The guest house is situated at a very well location around lush green pine forests, room are well modernize with modern amenities and staff was well behaved.  Also, Picturesque Pithoragarh town is a delight for mountaineers, trekkers, adventure seekers, botanists, pilgrims as well as sightseers. It is an important halt on the famous Kailash Mansarovar Yatra",Ashish Rawat,/Profile/himalayan_son,"New Delhi, India",50

pithoragarh,"It is located away from the main town. Next to Ulkadevi mandir n Chandak road. If you are using public transport, then you need walk more than one kilometer from bus station. You need to depend completely the hotel for food. Thou rooms are big enough, It shows their age. Not properly maintained. It is smelly. Bedding items are not washed. No towel and other bathroom amenities. Only good thing is Staffs are good. Location is so peaceful.",ProfWolfMan,/Profile/ProfWolfMan,"Yokohama, Japan",20
pithoragarh,Room Service was very good. Rooms are smelly and not cleaned. Nice view from room. Staff is humble. KMVN Manager is good guy. Food was very pathetic but if you want you can ask them to cook food according to you.,Ankur J,/Profile/AnkurJ259,,20
pithoragarh,My friend and I stayed at the Hotel in November 2014. The Hotel has large rooms and bathrooms. While the room and bathroom were reasonably clean the furnishings and fittings were dated and not well maintained. The staff however were very friendly and we were served excellent meals.,Anil M,/Profile/anilm2014,"Noida, India",30
pithoragarh,There was nothing much to see and do at Pithoragarh. The rooms were very big and clean but food was not available other than only chapati. We were asked to manage curry from outside as they could only provide chapati and salad in dinner. The hotel is not so close from the local market. Fortunately our driver was very keen to drive us to the local market at late evening to arrange for our dinner. Suggest not to plan a night stay at Pithoragarh.,RBan26,/Profile/RBan26,"Bengaluru, India",20
