pithoragarh,"We reached Pithoragarh in the afternoon and were hungry after a long journey.  The hotel staff took a long time to serve us.   There are no lifts and we got our room on the second floor, which was painful to go up and down for dinner or going out of the hotel.  Location is also not too good.  It is in middle of very congested street, takes quite some time to take your vehicle out.  A large mound of filth was nearby, which too appeared as an eyesore to me.",RAJENDRA884 PRASAD,/Profile/GuruGhummakad,"Faridabad, India",30
