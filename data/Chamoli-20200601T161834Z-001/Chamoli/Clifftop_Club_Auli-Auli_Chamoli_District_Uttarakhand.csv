Chamoli,So this was our family trip during december-19. We had planned visiting AULI few months before so it was pretty much planned trip. Uttarakhand: When you plan a trip to this state majority people would believe its trip to temples & nothing more.So we planned that there would be no temple visits just  family trip with full of enjoyment.Since it was December the chardham routes are closed. In uttarakhand you need to travel by road transport that is only way to reach AULI. After reaching dehradun airport it takes atleast 12-13 hours to reach AULI so we splitted in 2 days. Airport to Rudrapayag & then next day early morning Rudraprayag to Joshimath. The whole char dham yatra route is under construction & work is carried out simultaneously so there are lots of stoppages which may,Mayurb0123,/Profile/Mayurb0123,"Mumbai, India",40
Chamoli,the hotel has the best views thats the sole reason for my rating. otherwise the hotel is not that clean. the food is also average.but keeping in mind the connectivity and availability it was good. its an average hotel just bcz of the view that it has i have given an upper rating to it.yes its expensive too.,divyajatania,/Profile/divyajatania,,40
Chamoli,My husband and I booked this property thinking that we will learn skiing as it is considered as one of the best skiing resort but we were very disappointed looking at the condition of this place . Not at all RCI GOLD CROWN PROPERTY. Very shabby and very dirty . Not at all maintained and in a very sorry condition . In freezing conditions the heater in the rooms were not working at all and because of all these things we had to cancel our plans and we went back very disappointed and dissatisfied. Not at all recommended to anyone. Thumbs down 👎 for everything ,MumbaiAnju,/Profile/MumbaiAnju,"Mumbai, India",10
Chamoli,We made an unplanned trip to Auli to celebrate our anniversary in Jan. It was the most lovely decision to book us up at cliff top for a day... The resort is situated right at the top of the cliff as the name suggests. It gives a clear view of Nanda devi range ... And you should not miss the sunset for anything as that's when you see the glittering peaks.. it's a breathtaking view... The hotel itself was well equipped with power back up however the back up wasn't available for the entire day. The food and service was great as they serve all meals due to non availability of any restaurants nearby. You have to take the cable car from joshimath to reach this place (pillar #8). Unfortunately the lift to get down wasn't working when we visited and there was nobody to receive us from,Pinaki 921,/Profile/Pinaki921,"Pune, India",40

Chamoli,Positives  1. View  2. Staff 3. The ski outlet just at the entrance (nain singh bhandari)  4. Food (Indian only) - tell them how you want it and they won’t disappoint)  Negatives 1. Horrible dependency on state electricity supply - take your own risk when temperatures are negative. No heating options.  2. Fuel supply for generator depends on weather so be careful. 3. Resort is extremely dirty and there is no cleaning done at all. Blame it to the Visitors as well who throw cigarette buds in the lobby.  4. Snow / ice is not cleared or shoveled at all that makes the place look shabby. 5. The staff and locals chew tobacco and spit on snow that is horrible.  6. The building is in a shabby state and needs maintenance upgrade overhauling.   CHOOSE ANY OTHER OPTIONS Unless must.   ,Barin D,/Profile/932barind,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",10

Chamoli,"The hotel has very high amenities charges because of the altitude they are at. However, they still could not maintain the property well. basic things such as water was lacking and we had to check out after 2 nights inspite of 7 nights booking. We strongly recommend to book at the Garhwal Vikas Nigam resort (Government one), as they have transportation until this place and clifftop is another half kilometer drive up (but no road - can drive at one's own risk) or a steep hill trek up.  The staff has no sense of hospitality as none of them are trained professionals. However, if you talk to them beyond your comfort zone, they will slowly warm up and respond to you. if you go with young kids it can be quite inconvenient.

But the resort itself is in a very bad shape. All the awards they have won is way back in 2001. No maintenance at all. Most places the spiders have made their home and some spaces look like haunted! Unfortunately the only other resort is a Gharwal govt owned and no idea how good or bad that is. Hence most stay in Clifftop.

Cliff Top is the only dec e.g. resort which looks pretty has good rooms and the food is also good. But the service of is absolutely pathetic.   One has to call many times for room service or house keeping before being attended to.  That was pretty disappointing.    Rooms are good but no one comes to do them up and I ended up doing that myself.  staff is not friendly. and many times phones go unanswered so when I made the trip down to the reception, I found none around.

So if you're coming from some other location ensure you start early not to miss this chairlift which runs between from Auli GMVN and ends at 200m distance from Clifftop resort. If you miss the chairlift or the service is closed for some reason, the other option is to call resort and they'll send a 4x4 Gypsy and that journey of 4km from GMVN to resort is really really bad.

Staff is highly uneducated and ill mannered.  3. Room heater works only when you keep somethig under it. Means you can not place it easily from its original place.  4. Very Small CRT TV is kept almost 150 meter from the bed. No electric kettle provided.Used soaps and shampoos are scattered here and there inside the washroom. Bedsheet has lots of hairs on it indicating that cleaning is once in a month.  5. Food orders were served very late and was prepared in the used oil.  6.

For the good part, in the summers you can plan some amazing day treks to nearby points (about 3-4 of them) with the help of a resident guide; while in the winters you have the ski slope right next to the resort.  Other than that, it is a pretty run down place. One might wonder if it has ever been maintained since it was built over 10-12yrs ago. Rooms are dingy with old carpets that cry for replacement; kitchenette is just passable - with missing utensils and need to be asked for specifically.

The last 4 kms of the road are not good as as per the rules they cannot be made and hence it is the rough mountain drive which cannot be done at night as it is highly dangerous. There is a army cantt at the bottom of the climb so it is a little bit assuring. I would advise only Trolleys and you can leave your car at joshi mutt.

Chamoli,"The place was phenominal! the fact that each room faced the moutains and when you stepped out of your room, you would step into the world of snow was simply unforteable experience!",meeravelury,/Profile/meeravelury,Bangalore,40
Chamoli,"It is located at a beautiful hill top over looking the nanda devi , and the other snow caped mountains . Rooms are nice and clean . They have a amazing skiing slop .",Monaal,/Profile/Monaal,Mumbai,40
Chamoli,"We went thier in mid march 09 . unfortunately there was not much snow around the resort although the skiing season is supposed to last till end of march .  We however did a trek to the top of the hill where we did find snow lying on the ground .  It is ideal to go their during skiing season where the hotels central locations makes it an ideal place to ski in india, during summers you have the highest peaks like Nanda devi and Trisul for company and you can do some nice treks to the top of the mountain.  The resort has good food , larhe rooms and also provide kitchen facilites so carrying some maggi and bread butter is advisable. In summer max stay should not be more than 2-3 days .",vikramg,/Profile/vikramg,new Delhi,40
Chamoli,"The Cliff Top Club, Auli , is located at a height of 10,000 feet above sea level. It is a sking resort in winter , from January to March , every year. We were sure that Auli would be fairy land during those days of the year. When you go there on other months of the year, (like we did in May 2008) , Auli is how  fairy land must be looking in those other days of the year.  One can take a winding road through a forest from Joshimath , in a car, to reach there. Or take the cable car , a twenty minute ride from Joshimath , which we took ( Rs. 500 per person , one way).  The first thing one notices as you get off from the cable car are more-than-stunning views of the majestic Himalayas and no other buildings /hotels/shops as far as the eyes can see! Nothing at all except some",ritiroybetai,/Profile/ritiroybetai,Pune,40
Chamoli,"we stayed at the clifftop resort in feb 09. though the peak season is jan-mar, due to draught conditions in uttarakhand this yr the snowfall was very late. luckily for us, it snowed on 2 days that v were there are this made our trip worthwhile. the travellling to this place is very tiresome and u lose half yr energy there. but the views from the hotel are beautiful. i havent seen the himalayas so close from anywhere else.  we tried some skiing while v were there. it was good too. the only problem for this hotel is that it is not centrally heated. and trust me that is a big problem as the temp dip to -7C at night. it gets very very cold and all u are provided with is a small heater which is not even sufficient for one person leave alone the entire room. also the lobby/restaurant",morningdew_19,/Profile/morningdew_19,"Mumbai, India",40
Chamoli,"Place was terrible. We were lied to about the snow conditions, room, facilities and transportation. If you are going to ski then save your time and money and head to Gulmarg. The hotels there are basic but at least you won't be ripped off. The plus points were the views, the exciting journey and the staff. The management and booking agents were willing to say anything to make sure we spent our money!",NMac,/Profile/nmacca12,"Toronto, Canada",10
Chamoli,"Our stay was excellent. Room Service was great and food was awesome, but the best feature is the view... you get a panoramic view of the himalayas straight for your hotel room. Watching sunrise over the awe inspiring himalayan mountain range while lying in bed was awe inspiring.  Hotel is very close to scenic places and you could either hike or get a pony directly at the hotel. You could also arrange trips to Badrinath, Hemkund and the beautiful Valley of flowers from the hotel itself.  Auli is also one the best ski places in India and the hotel is right next to the ski ranges.  Highly recommended if you go to Auli.",sachendra,/Profile/sachendra,"Bengaluru, India",50
Chamoli,"The hotel is situated in a fine location.  Rooms are good and rustic.  The view is beautiful, but make sure that you get a valley facing room and not a window facing a wall.  the service is very slow and there seems to be some sort of politics going on between the room service team and the house keeping. . . (pass the buck seems rampant).   Food has lost its appeal and the service has lost its finer touch. The delays in F&B are very common even for mundane things.",Hrihsimodi,/Profile/Hrihsimodi,"New York City, New York",30
Chamoli,Lovely site and lovely grounds -- you can watch the staff play cricket with a panorama of mountains in the background. Access is either by a bumpy back road or a chair lift. The lift is preferable and it takes your luggage as well. The hotel is rustic but attractive. The room is an apartment but it is only heated with a space heater which is barely adequate even for the bedroom. I had to ask for a top sheet. The staff was disorganized but did a good job when they got around to it. The food was decent. They never turned on the hot water heater (I didn’t get to it until late at night when the front office was closed) so I had to go without a shower. They had internet access -- just 24k but it was complementary. Not near any town -- Joshimath is at the bottom of the chair lift.,Paul K,/Profile/go2places,California,30
