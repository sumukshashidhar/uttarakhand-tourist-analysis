Chamoli,"My husband, my brother and myself stayed at this hotel.  We found it cosy and clean and I enjoyed the views pf the mountains and river.  But what really made it was the staff who were really helpful.  Pradeep the manager was especially so.  Little touches like filling up our water bottles with filtered water so that we didn't have to buy more bottled water (we didn't want to create the plastic waste) was sweet.  Thanks for making our stay so pleasant!",Mei-Chi,/Profile/mccchan,,50

I knew it was going to be a beautiful place to stay by the opening and blessing ceremony that I got to attend before I moved in. This place has special energy. The location is literally the best in Rishikesh and I can say this with authority as I have stayed in other areas but this place was by far my favourite, close to great cafes, the Ganga and yoga classes. The view from the rooms, yoga space and restaurant are unparalleled. Vicky and his family and team are incredible hosts and I can‚Äôt wait to return.",Lou,/Profile/loukelle,,50
