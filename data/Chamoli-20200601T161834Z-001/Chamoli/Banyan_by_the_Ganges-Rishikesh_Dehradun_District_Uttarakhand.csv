I was so glad that I booked this property located in Devprayag at the confluence of Alakanda and Bhagirathi river.

We felt pampered. The food was delicious. The property however, could be a little better maintained. A small kitchen garden would increase the aesthetics of the place. While the tent has all the modern amenities, an intercom would be an additional plus. Also, sometimes, the line to the geyser in the bathroom would be disconnected and hot water would not be available.

Its an uphill climb most of the times, so keep sufficient time at hand. Coming to the property, its a unique concept very rare now a days. Its not place for the network freaks who cant live without their gadgets for a while, and a place only for such who could give up the temptation for sometime as there is no phone network around, yes not even for calls at times. This is a place to connect to nature very deeply. Its view is a work of art by god himself. Its an awesome setting by the ganges which can only be soaked by your eyes forever.

Its about 20 mins drive from the sangam of the Bhagirathi and Alaknanda rivers - a truly divine location, where the waters are pristine and the only sounds you hear are those of the mighty Ganges flowing unstoppable by night or day.   We traveled through the hills to get here towards the last leg of our journey through Uttarakhand. We chose this place as we wanted to be away from the crowds of Rishikesh & we were absolutely delighted. The journey is a bit arduous through the hilly ranges to get here - but not to be missed for the sheer beauty and landscape you see along the way.

The camp (well it’s far more glamorous than a camp) is located about 3 hours from Dehradun. It’s bang on the river and fairly secluded. The drive to the camp is absolutely stunning since you skirt the river throughout. We got there just before lunch time and were warmly greeted. Check in was quick and we were escorted to our “tents”. The tents are gorgeous! They’re actually rooms with tent canopies. The bathrooms are massive. The best thing about the room was the mattress. God so comfortable!

This is a cozy property, with just 12 swiss cottages, that lends to the charm. The rooms are spartan in keeping with the rustic feel of the place, with super comfortable beds and duvets.

Moreover we were lucky enough to meet the owners Titto and his wife Taruna who cooked mouthwatering dishes all through out our stay... In a nut shell, a splendid vacation !",Pritam B,/Profile/772pritamb,,50
Chamoli,"We stayed in the tents that were on the river side. The sheer majesty of the Ganga sweeping in two consecutive loops is in itself an incredible treat for the eyes. What is totally unexpected is the hugely comfortable beds, the beautiful bathrooms and numerous other details. Food is delicious and plentiful. The camp hosts are gracious and great for you if you are rafting or kayaking. I ran a training programme and the ingenuity of the folks in meeting my outlandish demands was praiseworthy. Am certainly going back for work and leisure.",SanjeevRoy,/Profile/SanjeevRoy,"Gurgaon, Haryana, India",50
Chamoli,Great location with views and some of the best mahsheer fishing in north India. There are two amazing stretches for rafting. Food is fantastic and the staff very friendly. Will keep going back. We had gone in a big family group and everyone loved it starting from my 4 year old daughter,dickysingh,/Profile/dickysingh,"Sawai Madhopur, India",50
Chamoli,This is by far the best luxury camp on the banks of Ganges. Location is superb and facilities and service is outstanding. Staff is so friendly and always willing to go an extra mile in making your stay a wonderful experience. AN ideal place for a few days off from hustle and bustle of city life and spend time in serenity with friends and family,sbansal74,/Profile/sbansal74,Gurgaon,50
Chamoli,"As titled the location is fabulous, right on the river and away from all the other camps and hotels of Rishikesh. You can let go and recharge your batteries and/or test your mind and body on the rafts, biking, kayaking etc etc.   Kudos to the team, a very well put together place which reflects their passion. The accommodation - Tenttages ( a mix of tent and cottages) is very comfortable and the food delicious.",ranthambore,/Profile/ranthambore,"Sawai Madhopur, India",50
Chamoli,"We are world travellers and rate our experience of Banyan by the Ganges highly. What appealed most to us was the soothing serenity of the place. The resort overlooks the river Ganges flowing through secluded hills. The changing hues of the river from deep blue to coral green to light blue grey were mesmerising. And when we wanted some excitement, we went rafting. Rapids were exciting and the body surfing heavenly. Imagine yourself floating in the river with mountain walls rising high on both sides! Must mention that the rafting outfit was professional and we never felt threatened. We enjoyed walks on the old Char Dham pilgrimage route and were rewarded with the sight of three Yellow Throated Martins coming down the hill. Good food and helpful staff enriched the experience.

Chamoli,"Beautiful boutique resort set in an excellent location. The place is not too far away from Delhi and can be reached in ~6 hrs. We visited the place along with a few friends and really loved the entire setting, from amazing views of the Ganga to the luxury tented accommodation, to the large and spacious dining area, the excellent food and warm hospitality of the entire staff. Added to this the owners personal touch just made our vacation extremely memorable. One can easily observe that they have taken a lot of interest while building this property, as they have looked into every small detail. Limited cell connectivity, evening bonfires and a heartful laughter with random strangers made us completely forget our busy and mundane city lives. The calm serene environment of the resort",Akhil P,/Profile/nomad_akhil_puri,"Noida, India",50
Chamoli,Picturesque views in the lap of nature. Had an awesome vacation in this property. Must mention the great hospitality by the hosts Mr and Mrs Khan and Mr. Manishankar Ghosh. Too supportive staff and people around. Really felt serene and divine with natural meditation music played by GANGA.  Nice tent rooms. Nice location in between of river and hills.  Tasty and homely food. No network signal except BSNL but it disconnects you to connects to yourself :) I strongly recommended for all nature lovers and people in search of real peace. Five stars.,Neha G,/Profile/NehaG1018,,50
