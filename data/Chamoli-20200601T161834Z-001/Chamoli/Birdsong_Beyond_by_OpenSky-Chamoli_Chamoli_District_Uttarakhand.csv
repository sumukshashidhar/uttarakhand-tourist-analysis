Chamoli,"It is 45 kms away from rudraprayag and situated in footsteps of durgadhar temple. Care taker is good and helpful but didnt served good dinner however, breakfast was good and tasty. Place was not well maintained bushes were not cut because of which its not possible to have walk outside. if you wanna have glimpse of life in mountains its good experience",Ridhima,/Profile/ridhima_2511,,30
Chamoli,"Cottage were good, we took 3 rooms and unfortunately before we arrived one of the beds was broken (we had to adjust there). Facility was not cleaned, looking like someone has not done the cleaning from a week or so. Only one person to take care of all the things which resulted in a bit of Delay sometimes.",hiteshbedi,/Profile/hiteshbedi,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
Chamoli,A majestic view of the Himalayas from every bedroom. However be ready to be greeted with swarms of flies. The water from the bathroom taps was full of sand/dirt and its advisable to drink mineral water during your stay,venkat_sinha,/Profile/venkat_sinha,"Lucknow, India",20
Chamoli,"Pokhari was kind of a highlight (and surprise package) of our tour. We booked 2 rooms (basically had whole of the cottage to ourselves - 3 rooms in the cottage). The views are super and its a great sight to wake up to sunrise in the Himalayas (peaks are visible if there are no clouds) and Chopta hills. Cottage has big windows ensuring great views and the sunlight to reach to the interior of the cottage rooms. The property is small and has orange trees and other farms around. Those looking for relaxed holidays, village walks, fresh mountain air would definitely love it. Karthikswamy temple is also nearby... There are no other commercial properties around and so it's kind of a home-stay with luxury. Food is prepared by the caretaker and the bathrooms have hot running water.

Chamoli,This place was real beauty .. it all seemed unreal ! We totally loved the place. All services were good including the food. The room was super clean and quite spacious and beautifully decorated. Thumbs up !,Alfredo812,/Profile/Alfredo812,"Miami, Florida",40
Chamoli,"Pros :  1. Great location , overseeing the range - french windows in each of the rooms in the main cottage opens to a mesmerizing view of the range  2. Plenty of reading materials of all genre's - someone looking for a quite stay will not get bored ( unless you are not the reading kind )   3. Decent food quality ( don't expect much at this altitude or budget )  Cons :  1. Structural issues in the bathroom - don't be surprised to wade into a puddle after a bath because the water doesn't go out or takes ages to trickle out   2. General Water supply - Water is usually not available between 10 am -5 pm , so do your cleaning ( includes the body ) prior or after the time stamp.",Soumen N Choudhury,/Profile/SoumenBLR,"Bengaluru, India",30
