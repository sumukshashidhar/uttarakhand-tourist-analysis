Chamoli,"We were recommended Blue Poppy and it was a decision that was definitely correct. The property is made up of cosy and lovely cottages and is very close to the ropeline. The highlight of our stay was the staff- they were the most friendly and helpful. From arranging tea and snacks in the evening to giving us hot water despite freezing, they did everything with a smile and made us feel welcome. The food is also homely, hygienic and tasty. Overall, super experience. Thanks Blue Poppy and the team. 5 star",Vids,/Profile/Vids2184,,50

Chamoli,"We stayed here in Feb 2020 end. There was plenty of snow around the rooms and in Auli. The resort rooms have almost everything that one would need at a cold place like this. There is a room heater, hot water kettle, ample blankets, electricity back-up etc. The staff is courteous and quite helpful. The ski point and cable chair station is barely 50m from the resort which makes the resort an location. Couple of things on which they can work on are - room water heaters are missing, path to higher located rooms which is extremely slippery owing to the snow everywhere should be maintained. The resort can consider building some hand supporters on the edge with the help of which people can support themselves while climbing back to their rooms, reaching the ski-spot , restaurants etc. ",Snehal K,/Profile/Sneh85,"Mumbai, India",40

Chamoli,"We visited Auli in Feb-20. We had a stay of 2 nights at Blue Poppy. Everything about it was so beautiful and efficient.  Their strengths are excellent location, poetic views from the windows, a huge variety of lip smacking food, cosy cottages, necessary accessories like electric room heaters and electiclly heated blankets and a prompt and helpful staff. The availability of water for non-drinking purposes was however limited, which is understandable. It was still surprising how they could manage so many resources at such an inaccessible and remote place.  I am really happy that my tour operator chose them. I will definitely recommend them to my friends.  Make sure that your driver will drop you at Auli.

Chamoli,"We stayed in Blue Poppy for a memorable three days and two nights. The log cabin was perfect for our family of three - my wife and me with our three year old daughter. Despite our initial worries about the sub-zero temperatures, the cabin's heater and electric blankets kept us and our little one comfortable throughout the night and the staff went out of their way to accomodate us all throughout. With the cabin facing the valley, the views the sorrounding peaks including the summit of the magnificent Nanda Devi were truly breathtaking. The staff are extremely helpful and prompt and made it a very homely experience. Food was excellent and served piping hot - classic comfort food given the cold weather.

They have provided a number on their website to manage bookings of some Ms Manisha, who does not even know the H of hospitality and is rudeness personified. I was to book for a stay 4 days away from the date, and I had categorically told her I was coming for my first wedding anniversary. I confirmed that I would be coming and asked her to block, after which she stopped replying. I got in touch again and she asked for a 50% advance but I said I would only be able to pay at the property and if I could speak to a giver authority regarding this.

But they lacked the minimum facilities (heater, lack of electric blankets, water - both for drinking and other purposes). We did understand that the same was due to heavy snowfall and electricity cut but the complaint was that we weren't informed in advance about this. It is when we reached an altitude of 3000 mts covered with snow all around, that we were informed that this is the situation.

In previous many reviews it was written the way to the hotel was not safe still the owner of the hotel has not paid any heed to this. They charge so much and despite the complains nothing has been done about the path. I dnt think it would cost so much to pave the path and add railings. 2: because it was so cold and snowing the water supply was not there in the rooms. They provided water in buckets.

Any homestay has a better hospitality and amenities as compared to this 'resort'.  There is nothing good about this place except for the location.  We were a group of 4 so we stayed at one of the family huts. The hut was compact and pretty to look at but lacked basic things like a rack in the bathroom to hang clothes or even keep soaps and toiletries. I'm not even complaining about the issue with hot water. It is understandable that installing solar geysers will take investment.  The carpets in our room were torn and mother eaten.

There is no room service so one has to go to the dining hut for all meals. Only vegetarian meals are served and there is no bar.  Hot water is an issue since there are no geysers installed.

Great location on a hill top next to the very popular Garhwal  Vikas Mandal Resort and Ropeway to the skiing slopes. 2.	Lovely view. 3.	Functional rooms, well equipped with kettles for hot water and to make tea (coffee sachets not provided). What can be improved: 1.	There are almost 100 steps from the car park to the property. When you reach this place after a 12 ‚Äì 14 hour road journey, you are really tired. And if it is raining, as it does frequently in the hills, one expects the property to provide you umbrellas. They do not have any. 2.	We were not getting hot water in the bathroom in the evening. It",Motumotu,/Profile/Motumotu,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
Chamoli,I had made my arrangements for the trip to valley of flowers through Bluepoppy group. They have done their job very well from Booking till we are back from the trip . Stay at Bluepoppy cottage at auli was very cozy and amazing . Valley of flowers is a beautiful and a must vist place . One thing which our tourism department should take care is about the way to valley of flowers which is now completely polluted with pony dung which will definitely affect in attracting the foreign tourists why to say even we couldn‚Äôt tolerate that . I have a request to Bluepoppy and other tourists agents to request the government to keep this area much more cleaner. And to make a separate trekking route to the tourists who wishes to go for only  trekking (not for pilgrimage ).

Except Haridwar where there was access to resources other places with limited resources they had made our stay and trip comfortable. A guide accompanied us through out our trek and was very knowledgeable.   Valley of flowers is Haven on Earth, and we enjoyed every moment. We went twice to the valley to keep our memories even more fresh.   We even visited Hemkund but it was too cloudy and visibility was very less. We could not visit Badarinath temple due landslide.

That basically is story of all services here. First the good points; Blue poppy has a good website & has done great marketing. There ends the good part.  Nothing is assured, itinerary sent to you two days before departure will be changed without even a word with you. Meals included will not be given as you have to travel early(Breakfast not given to us on 29th july morning as we needed to travel by 0630 AM). Lunch was served without vegetables as they could not bring it from market.

The wooden cottages are very charming and lovely to stay in. The staff is very helpful. Infact, Raghuveer the caretaker there went out of the way to help us get a cab back to auli when our vendor cancelled on us last minute. The food was homely and good. GMVN guesthouse close by has a chair car there to reach auli lake. It's a wonderful experience do take it. From the Auli lake, you can do two easy treks - to Gorson Valley and Chattrakund lake.

Very close to the chair car that takes you to the tower no. 8. From there, its a nice trek to tower no. 10. They serve home-like food. Some of the features are worth mentioning like the photos inside and out of the rooms are personally clicked  and place by the owner. The rooms are well maintained. Lot of thought has been given to the details. If one takes the rope way from Joshimath, one has to walk about 800 metres from the tower no. 8 to reach this resort.

Above all the rooms are quite spacious and made of wood. You can feel the aroma once you entered. The rooms are equipped with LCD, room heaters and running hot water. The staff is very helpful.

The time taken from Rishikesh to Auli is 9-10 hours. But we made a mistake and started little late from Rishikesh, thereby reaching Auli very late. I would recommend to start very early from Rishikesh.   Food was simple but tasty. Kind of a homely food. Staff is very cooperative and helpful.",Ananya k,/Profile/Ananyak88,,50

One most important tip : Start early from Haridwar / Rishikesh so as to reach Auli by before sunset. It takes almost 10 hours from Haridwar. Google maps are not to be believed here in terms of ETA. Good place for bird watchers as well. The whole resort is constructed with wood. They can help you in planning the itinerary, getting a guide for trek to Gorson top.

Outside, the mountains played hide and seek in the monsoon mist.  Now in January the resort and its environs are blanketted with snow.
