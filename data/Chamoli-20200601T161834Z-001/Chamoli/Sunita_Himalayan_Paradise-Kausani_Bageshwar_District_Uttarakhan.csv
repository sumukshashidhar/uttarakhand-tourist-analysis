Chamoli,"Me, My Son and My nephew visited this resort on 23rd and 24th Jan 2020. Our purpose was to simply spend some time in this small hamlet called Kausani. High on our priority list was astrophotography. The resort has a fabulous terrace which gives clear views of skies in North, East and South East. The staff and the manager of the front office Mr Shivam was very helpful. They offered all the help they could and even went out of the way in helping us in the cold nights. The rooms were EXCELLENT and very CLEAN. Washrooms too were hygienic and had geysers installed. The rooms has a lovely balcony. Sitting here basking in the sun was probably the most relaxing experience. The Hotel serves fabulous FOOD. We had breakfast and dinner here. Believe me, the food was EXCELLENT and the staff",Pankaj,/Profile/PANKAJ_ASTRO,,50
Chamoli,I stayed here on the 13th of December when Kausani witnessed the season's first snowfall. The room was spacious and clean. Toilets were clean too but there was not enough space on the wash basin slab for the toilet kit. A little more space for toiletries is required. Food was nice and service was good. The view from the hotel is just ultimate. One important thing about Kausani for Alcohol lovers. There is no wine shop in Kausani so do not forget to carry your quota.,The lone traveller,/Profile/TLL_201,"Faridabad, India",50

Chamoli,"The location of the hotel is very good as it is located on T.R.C view point road. We booke the executive non himalayan facing room, but after entering the room... it looked very dingy and moreover the quilt & bedspreads were not clean. The manager at the reception area was very adamant in changing our room but our concerns were genuine, so he did changed the room after lot of argument. Finally, the room we got had a beautiful view which we could enjoy from the balcony. The room size was good and it was clean as well. Rest of the staff was very friendly and helpful. They also had a huge terrace on which we went to enjoy the sunrise in the morning (which Kausani is famous for).",Crazy Spirits,/Profile/crazyspirits,"New Delhi, India",40

Chamoli,"We stayed at Sunita Himalayan Paradise in May-2019 for a family vacation. The staff at the hotel is very warm and friendly and try their best to help the guests. We stayed in one of the mountain facing rooms on the 3rd floor. The room has a balcony too. The view the valley from the balcony was amazing. However, we could not get a clear view of the 300 km long Nanda Devi Mountain range due to thick mist and smoke in the area. We came to know from the locals that the summer months are not ideal for viewing the mountain range due to mist and smoke. The smoke is caused by the local people setting fire to the grass so that new grass can grow for cattle.  Best time for viewing the mountain range is October to February.

Its around 1.5 Kms. and walking back at night can be dangerous as there’s no light. Star Gate observatory is a main attraction at night. Food is ok nothing great. Staff is decent.

Of course looking for the best place to stay was a big question since we had around 12 people in our group including couples. One of my close relative suggested me this beautiful place named Sunita Himalayan Paradise and there is no second thought that it's a beautiful place to stay in whole Kausani. The 360 degree picturesque view of mighty Himalaya and the beautiful city is just breathtakingly beautiful. The food is amazing. The staff is very friendly and prompt. The view from room itself is so beautiful that you can sit in the balcony and appreciate the nature's beauty whole day. I'm definitely planning to come back in near future with my family or friends.
