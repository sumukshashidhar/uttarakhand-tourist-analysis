Chamoli,"We stayed at Ganga resort in July on our way to Ghangharia and it was wonderful. Rooms were spacious and very clean. We got an extra mattress without any additional cost. Home cooked food from their kitchen garden was delicious. The best part was the hospitality. Mr. Arvind is a great host and is very helpful. There was no network and we could not locate our driver on our way back from Ghangharia. He let us make multiple calls from his mobile, served us tea and was willing to lend us money as we had run out of cash. It was a very kind gesture. I would recommend this place to anyone who visits Govindghat.",shreyasi c,/Profile/shreyasic2014,,50

A relatively new property, it is very close to the bridge over the river in Govindghat which is also the starting point for trek/pony ride towards Ghangaria and car ride (only up to Pulna). We stayed one night on our way to Ghangaria and one night on our way back. Shri Arvind Sharma and his wife takes very good care of the guests and we  were treated with food which included fruit and vegetables from their own garden. The rooms were spacious with geyser in bathrooms (an important need). Shri Sharma also helped with mobile phone calls if your network is not available. If you keep going straight on the road after entering Govindghat you will find signage for 'Homely Stay' by which this property",anirudas,/Profile/anirudas,"Port of Spain, Trinidad",50
