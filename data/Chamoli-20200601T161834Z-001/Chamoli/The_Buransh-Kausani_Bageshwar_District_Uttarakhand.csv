Chamoli,"I was here in the first week of March, together with my husband and fellow photographers, to attend a Himalayan Landscape Photography Workshop, mentored by eminent photographers such as H Satish, Gurdas Dua, Anil Risal Singh and Threesh Kapoor ji himself. We spent a memorable four days at this heavenly abode. The property is very well laid out. Every room has full view of the Himalayan peaks such as Mount Trishul, Nanda Devi, etc. We never got tired of looking at the varying landscape every minute of the day. The gardens attached to the property had lovely peach and buransh blooms. Food was very yummy. Afternoon tea was a ritual to look forward to, especially considering that the weather was very cold. The icing on the cake was of course our ever gracious host, Threesh Kapoor",AnithaMysore,/Profile/Achuani,,50
Chamoli,"The Buransh is most ideally located at Kausani, with a fantastic view of the Trishul in the Himalayan range.  Attended a photography workshop (4-8 Mar,2020) with 40 others. (my second one here) The resort has spacious and comfortable rooms with a view of the mountains.  Excellent food and personal touch by the hosts Mrs & Mr Threesh Kapoor.   An excellent photographer & Mountaineer himself, Mr Threesh Kapoor knows the Himalayas like the back of his hand!  He makes one feel so welcome that you would want to go there again & again!  Also a  most ideal resort to hold workshops, conferences & festivals.  Worth adding to your bucket list!",Prema Kakade,/Profile/PremaKakade,,50

Mr Kapoor, the owner, personally catered to every guest and is a wonderful and warm host. The Buransh hosts a lot of activities too - photography or art clubs. The only catch is the approach road. It's quite steep and is quite long. Climbing up this road, by walk or by car, isn't easy and it locks you in within the resort premises. ",archana_mrao,/Profile/archana_mrao,"Bengaluru, India",40

We felt as if we are visiting some of our relatives and they are eagerly waiting for their guests to arrive. The stay of 4 nights was very relaxing, homely. Mr Kapoor and his wife was always there to take care of our family. They shared many stories of their life with us. The food was lip-smacking and made with a touch of affinity.

His passion and accomplishments were evident in the beautiful slide show of his Himalayan photography that he put together for his guests one of the nights. The property and its staff gives a feeling of warmth. Except for the BSNL wifi ( LOL), everything else is perfect at The Buransh.

Everything is perfect,  be it  staff esp Ganesh,  thoughtful meals,  setting of the rooms,  warmth of Kapoor family,  slide shows on brief tour of Himalayas,  availability of books and indoor games for spending leisure time etc. My family loved every part of our stay at this resort. We enjoyed trekking starting from resort to Baijnath covering around 8 kms of forest on the first day and then 2 kms to Rudradhari waterfalls and  back on the second day. The best thing about Mr. Kapoor is that not only does he gel well with adults but equally well with children.

There weren't many (except a scary approach road and scanty room service perhaps) and even if there were, they were impossible to notice against the mesmerizing view of the Himalayas from our room window. If you visit Kausani for the view, you do not need to step out of The Buransh for a moment. You have the best view of the mountains sitting on your bed and when you need to feast something other than your eyes, the food in the restaurant is delicious.

They did not serve tandoor dishes; despite 7-8 rooms being booked; they said we are not operating tandoor. 6. I should have taken a pic of their recreation room and makeshift spa; it was dirtiest.
