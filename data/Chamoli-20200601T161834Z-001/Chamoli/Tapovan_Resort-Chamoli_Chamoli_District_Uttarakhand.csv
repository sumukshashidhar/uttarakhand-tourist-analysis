Chamoli,I had stayed at this resort about more than 20 years ago when it was just a basic motel with 2/3 rooms. We were driving from Rishikesh to Badrinath and looking for a decent place to stay for the night. Even then we were very well looked after and served hot steamy food. I remember it was a full moon night and we took a stroll on the shores of Alaknanda. The entire atmosphere was just heavenly. It's a must place for all visitors on  the way to Badrinath/Kedarnath.,ShyamShroff,/Profile/ShyamShroff,"Mumbai, India",40

Chamoli,We stayed two nights in this resort - one night on our way to Badrinath and one night on the way back.   It is a very peaceful and safe place to stay and the staff are extremely hospitable. The rooms are spacious. The food is very good and service is prompt.   Due to road expansion work going on right in front there is always a lot of dust around but the staff do their bit to try and clean up every now and then.   Overall one of the best and cosy places to stay enroute to Badrinath/Govind Ghat.,Debashis Mukherjee,/Profile/debmuk-traveller,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
Chamoli,"We stopped here for a night on our way to Govind Ghat... This place was expensive but since August is low season we could negotiate a deal for 3500 for two rooms. The rooms faced the main road & were very clean.  The water was hot & toilets clean. Since we were the only occupants, the dinner menu was limited but whatever the chef prepared was simply superb...Clean & Bold flavours. The paranthas for breakast were exceptionally good too.  The only drawback is that there is nothing around it except the mighty river that flows on the opposite side of the road & that too almost 20 feet below the road level.   Place i would definitely stay if ever go to Hemkund Sahib Again",vinaybasutkar,/Profile/vinaybasutkar,"Bengaluru, India",50

Chamoli,"On our destination to Badrinath, we decided to take a break somewhere in between to a place which is serene, peaceful and close to nature and Tapovan resort turned out to be not only a-picture-perfect place but immaculate. If you look at it from outside its a home away from home.! Starting with an instant feeling of belongingness which takes over and stays with you till the end. Rooms are cozy and tastefully decorated. Coming to food, the resort has plenty to offer. We departed next morning and still carry with us unforgettable memories.!
