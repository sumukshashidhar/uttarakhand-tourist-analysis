We were upgraded for free for the most expensive suite (ideal for four) with as good as view of the Himalayas as from the the view from the Gandhi Asram, Kausani.

Chamoli,"Kausani is the lesser popular hill station because it is still untouched by commercialisation, so all that you do is enjoy the changing colours of sun on mountains, the rain and do Himalaya Darshan as the name of our property suggests.  The road (there is no road actually) from the city to the property is in a very bad shape. A fairly new property, which I believe has a lot of scope for improvement. The rooms are not airy, i.e. no scope for cross ventilation, there is no common sitting area or lounge. They say they don‚Äôt want you to sit in the room, instead enjoy the Great Himalayas which no doubt is a majestic view. On clear days, they even call you in the morning to inform that you can see the Himalayas clearly. So basically the outdoor space is great to soak in the nature.

The hotel is tucked away in nature, completely off from the regular tourist crowd. So, it is a best choice for those who want to relax and have a leisure time. You can go for early morning or evening stroll. Only important caution is to call up the hotel after reaching kausani village, so that they will guide to take the correct route to hotel.

The service by the staff and their helpful nature is also commendable and the food prepared by them is very tasty. Directly calling them and booking may prove to be beneficial if you aren't getting a better deal online.  Another soothing part of staying at their cottages is the sounds of birds chirping and the extreme quietness.  A few points that I feel the resort can work upon are:  1. Have a couple of heaters in the dining area. It can get really cold in there. 2. Increase the size of the geyser. The hot water from the small geysers is barely enough for one person to shower and the other person would",Samir Khan,/Profile/SamirKhan85,"Hyderabad, India",50

One can sit in the resort and spend hours together gazing at the snow capped mountain. Sun rises are usually very beautiful. The early morning rays turn the snow capped mountain to golden yellow, revealing peak by peak as the rays hit them and finally turning to white. All this phenomenon can be experienced by sitting in your room and gazing at the peaks , which we did between 6 and 7 am. It was a wonderful experience.

Nestled against the alpine forests, the stay here truly gave us an experience of a lifetime.  Speaking about other things:  Location: Matchless by any other hotel in Kausani. Although it is a few kms. far from main Kausani area, but that completely cuts the hustle bustle of the town and provides nothing but tranquilizing calm and the only sound you get to hear is of running streams, breeze and birds Food: Amazing..!!

You can cover the entire market in around 4-5 hours. However, places nearby Kausani can be explored. So, if you're planning to stay only in Kausani, then 3 nights are sufficient.

The location of this resort is probably the most favourable feature which would attract anyone and maybe more than once.Cottages built on a hill with wilderness all around is what a metro-city inhabitant like me looks for. And the uncramped planning with unconventionally formal attendance of guests at this resort works just the right mix.

Chamoli,"We visited the place in winters. Weather was very pleasant. The resort is far from the town but it gives you exactly what a traveler looks for in Kausani. The view from the resort is breathtaking specially sunset if you are visiting Kausani in winters. The resort is surrounded by forest. You can go for a nature walk or for a bicycle ride. There are orange trees inside the resort.  The resort is very beautiful. Rooms are good. Rooms are not close to other rooms which gives you enough privacy. You can play games, have food, roam around or just sit outside the room and enjoy the view. ",Himanshu A,/Profile/travelographyindia,"New Delhi, India",40

It is secluded from the hustle bustle of city. Each cottage tastefully built for your comfort. Have a nice walk around the place and breath in fresh air with pine fragrance.

The same care extends to the visitors as well. Hotel staff try to make your stay as relaxed as possible. The views from hotel is outstanding, morning sun rise between the mountains is awesome and night sky is spectacular. The huts are well separated from each other so that no one disturbs your stay. there is play area for the kids plus a badminton court as well. Food served was good and included local varieties as well although more variety in breakfast is a welcome.

This is far from city, you've to travel some distance through forest to reach there and route from main road about 200 m, was not well maintained and it becomes little bad due to rains. Cottages were excellently maintained and clean. you can have a pleasant tea time and bonfire in nature (outside cottages) and enjoy the heavenly view of forest. Nanda devi peak and Trishula view are visible in evening and early morning(at sunrise). You can hear singing and chirping of birds. Great place for photography.

The resort has excellent tree plantation - which can serve one fruit in any season.   High-light : I do not know how many I am going to list down here. View --> Mind blowing is the word.

However, as we entered the road to the Resort (About 6 Kms from Kausani) the Himalayan Jungle started to engulf. And amidst a- nothing -short -of ‚Äìthe- forest-ride, we reached the resort.

The resort gives all facilities- good food, good rooms, friendly staff, bikes on rent. We were staying with our naughty 2.5 year old boy and the staff ensured that we had a great time.

It has a great Himalayan and greenish view. We really enjoyed even our early April visit at this place, so I wonder how beautiful it will look on monsoon or winter season. Overall a very good refreshing experience though I may point out few areas those can be revised for a better guest satisfaction. 1. The resort is around 6 km away from main market which is a plus point. But providing a car service on a lower rate to the guest can be great so that guest do not need to hire taxi on a higher rate. 2.

Chamoli,"We were a group of 12 when we visited Kausani. We opted for Himalaya Darshan Resort. With small kids, it was a bit tough drive from Kathgodam to Kausani. We had booked two taxis for the travel. The resort people called us regularly for guiding the routes. As the resort is 6 kms away from main Kausani town, the resort staff was waiting for us at a center point in Kausani. He escorted us to the resort which was like a dream place for me. All around you could just see trees and jungles. Soothing sound of waterfall flowing nearby. Hardly you could see people or buildings. PURE NATURE.  We were welcomed so warmly that we were overwhelmed.  The cottages in the resort were newly built, very well done, beautiful modern interiors.  Every cottage has a personal swing in the backyard.",manish_the_traveller,/Profile/manish9944,"Hisar, India",50
Chamoli,"Lovely property away from the crowds. Nestled among the pine trees with a wonderful view all around, it offers breathtaking views of surrounding hills and valleys. A room facing the hills is worth the money. For us India truly turned incredible following our 3 night stay at the Himalaya darshan resort,it was a awesome stay their with luxury we will be back again‚Ä¶",taniya800,/Profile/taniya800,"Ahmedabad, India",50
