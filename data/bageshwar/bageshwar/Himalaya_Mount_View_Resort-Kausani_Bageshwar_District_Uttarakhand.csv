bageshwar,"Location of this hotel is great, we got to see clear view of Himalaya ranges from our balcony, they also have terrace from where Himalaya ranges are clearly visible.  Rooms look old and have stinky bathrooms. Food is ok ok.   Overall my 3 stars are only for the great Himalayan views",Roopesh_M,/Profile/Roopesh_M,"Mumbai, India",30

The agent told this is the best hotel but i trusted him but the rooms are pathetic it’s like a lodge no one from the hotel is bothered I had checked in and checked out with in half an hour and booked another hotel paying extra money.

bageshwar,"go straight to the pros and cons of Himalaya Mount View Resort  1) this property is a little old and shabby. For those looking for grand hotel rooms with super-equipped facilities , this is Not for them 2) there is no attached handshowers in the washrooms and the washbasin doesnot have provisions for hot water directly from the geyser 3) Rooms are very large ( semideluxe ) but again as said earlier , a little shabby and unimpressive in appearance 4) we had some smell issues in the washroom , and had to call the hotel staff for room fresheners and changing of pillow covers immediately after checkin 5) Food is awesome and one can order multicuisine delicacies.  6) Room service is good but can be improved  7) This property has great parking space. Also it requires a lot of stair",Compass33603256556,/Profile/Compass33603256556,,40
bageshwar,Very poorly managed property. Rooms were very old and not cleaned properly. Bathrooms were very poor and water connections are also not in proper condition. Only plus point was its location and somewhat bearable food,Nandan G,/Profile/NandanG29,,10
bageshwar,"Good rooms, services & familiar staff. Worth to stay again. Super Deluxe Room are lovely. The beautiful view from the rooms & resort is breath taking. Mr. Bhanu ( MD ) is very co-operative person. Food is tasty.",Ravi L,/Profile/RaviL193,,50
bageshwar,"We stayed at this hotel for 3.5 days in mid-June of 2017, reached late due to traffic jam. On arrival though I had a booking for a Deluxe room, i guess they were trying to put me thru a semi-deluxe one on backside of the lowest floor. But when we resisted so easily gave us the Deluxe room on the first floor. So Moral of the story is opt for the room on the first floor or top floors if you want to enjoy the Himalayan View (pic attached-we were lucky to get this view on first day).  The Deluxe room was big enough to accommodate 3 people on one bed which was King Size. The room also had two single sofa chairs, one big centre table, one cupboard, LCD along with other things like electric kettle, coffee and tea saches.   The breakfast was complimentary and taste was good. Similar to",Rachittrips,/Profile/Rachittrips,"New Delhi, India",40
bageshwar,The location of the hotel is very good as it provides a great view of the peaks on a clear day. I was not lucky to have a clear view of the peaks as it was very hazy. In the night one can have beautiful view of Baijnath.  The upper rooms are good. Wifi does not work inside the rooms. One has to go to reception to use the Wifi.  Staff is good. Room service is also fine.,ShaileshSoni,/Profile/ShaileshSoni,"Mumbai, India",50
bageshwar,"Recently I visited with my wife and 08 years old son from nainital to kausani and stayed at this hotel. The hotel is on excellent location as per his name to view ranges of Mount Himalaya. Most of the rooms are mountain facing. Staff are very good and always smiling, room service is prompt but food quality is not up to the mark. we reached to hotel at evening and ordered ""Onion Pakora"" for snacks but  ""Onion Pakora"" are made with unused Onions from salad used in hotels lunch",Ghanshyamdasagarwal,/Profile/Ghanshyamdasagarwal,"Allahabad, India",40
bageshwar,"- Excellent Location : On a clear day you can see most of the peaks from the Hotel itself. We were able to clearly see Mt. Trishul, Nandaghunti etc. Sunrise also is a treat to watch. Very nice and pleasant weather, even though we visited in mid May - Very good and clean rooms and bathrooms. Electricity is off and on, typically gets cut off based on weather. No wi-fi is a blessing in disguise :-) ...enjoy the natural beauty - Very friendly staff and prompt service - Do try the fried rice - it's awesome and spicy !! - Tip -- keep the gallery of the room locked, the local monkeys could be too friendly and may pay you a visit",Vipul K,/Profile/VipulK222,,50

bageshwar,"If you are going to Kausani, you should give first preference to Himalaya Mount View Resort without second thought. They made our holidays splendid! One of the best hospitality I have ever experienced so far. Resort is at the top notch location where you can see the full Himalayan range right from your room/balcony. Its just 1/2 km away from main Kausani, so you can enjoy the beauty peacefully. Also Rooms are excellent, neat & clean. It has lots of open space born fire, sitting here & there, roaming around & enjoying the landscape. Hotel staff are very cooperative & helpful. Also the overall Room cleanliness, Hospitality, Food, Service was very good. We tried various Indian, Chinese & local dishes and they were so yummy.

bageshwar,"A place with a beautiful view of the snow clad Himalayas. All rooms are beautifully furnished with private balconies facing the Himalayan ranges. Since the hotel is on the slope of the valley, every room gets a view of the Himalayas. The hotel is close to the tea gardens and the hand loom factory. The staff are very cooperative, happy to receive us, the quality of food is good and a good roof top experience of camp fire. Very happy that we selected this property from all the options available.",OsdenF77,/Profile/OsdenF77,"Vasai, India",40

bageshwar,"According the various reviews we read,  before choosing this hotel, this hotel is one of the better hotels in Kausani.   No doubt the location is nothing short of fantastic, the service and the people are good. Infact we had one evening a chatting session on the terrace with the Hotel manager and a couple of locals, it was very enjoyable. Our entire stay was very good.  We wanted to walk to Rudhradhari falls and temple, the hotel provided with a young man to be our guide. On the way back he plucked up some local vegetable which looked interesting. On our request the cook prepared this dish for our dinner which was quite tasty.  More about the rooms, they are simple and large with with a private balcony which overlook the valley and could see the himalaya in the background.

bageshwar,"We went to Kasauni on December 2015 and stayed a night at this hotel. This hotel is located a bit far from the market place so its very quiet over there. You can see the entire Kumaon Mountain range like Trishul, Panchachulli, Nanda Devi from the balcony itself. The rooms are good and also staffs are quite good. The lawn is a good place to go for a camp fire. But most importantly the sight of sunrise from the balcony is a treat to watch. So overall if you want to stay closer proximity with nature this is the place.",Amrita2983,/Profile/Amrita2983,"Kolkata, India",50

We were alloted high end room and was informed that it has private balcony, well, this balcony was anything but private.  This balcony has excess from outside the room. Balcony was excesd by all other guest. We have to complaint to the manager on an average of 3 times a day.  From Balcony could see your room only window curtain inbetween which will make you feel that your privacy has been invaded.  About the room-Room had no lights only light available was bed side light.

bageshwar,"I have stayed at this hotel not once but every time we have crossed Kausani since 2006 which is at least 8 times. This resort is about a km away from the noise and crowd of the main market. It is on the main road with ample parking space (for cars) on the terrace and outside (for bigger vehicles). You can see the glorious Himalayas from all rooms irrespective of the tariff. Food is fresh and delicious but should be ordered in advance. This worked well for us considering we traveled with kids. We have always taken the deluxe rooms facing the reception for the proximity to the kitchen and space inside and outside the room. In all the visits there was one thing which has been consistent that is the cleanliness and the well maintained orchard, gardens and even potted plants.
