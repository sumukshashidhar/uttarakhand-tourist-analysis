bageshwar,"1. Not worth. The amount they are charging and the place they are giving it is worthless. 2. It is a Logde. Please donâ€™t call it a Resort. Shady rooms, towels not clean, pathetic rooms, no amenities. I was there with my Family and Friends, we paid a good amount to stay in a duplex, but it is all worthless. 3. I donâ€™t know itâ€™s been ages when they got renovated. Voice making stairs, floors, doors, windows, bed. Open wires, food was pathetic. We ordered 2 plate Veg Manchurian and they served only 1 plate after some time we ask them about another plate, so waiter replied us they served 2 plate quantity in one plate and charged two plate Manchurian, Also Food Menu is very costly like 5 star resorts,  No staff was in uniforms.

bageshwar,"Kausani is no doubt a wonderfully picturesque place. The view of the Himalayan ranges is truly awesome. However, do be careful to not go there when there are forest fires in the area. It happened to us unfortunately from the 2nd day onwards, the forest fires close by generated so much smoke that the view was completely obscured.  Coming to the Hotel itself. I believe it is one of the better places to stay in Kausani. The class of the Hotel is higher than the ones in the same area offering the same view. The Eco Lodge is made completely of WOOD except the washrooms. So, you end up getting a feel of a Log Cabin in the mountains.   We (three of us) stayed in the Dupleix apartment instead of a room.

Since we were there in the monsoon, we only got a rare glimpse through the flitting clouds of the snow-covered Himalayan peaks--I think we got a glimpse of the Trishul, Mrigthuni, and a teeny-weeny glimpse of Nanda Devi. But it was enough to give us the idea that from October onwards, when the sky's clear, the 350-km sweeping view of the peaks must be breathtaking.

bageshwar,"First, the only plus - The breathtaking view of the snow capped peaks visible from almost anywhere in the property - the rooms, the verandahs or the gardens.   Now for the rest -  I have stayed in a lot of eco - lodges/resorts where the 'less is more' mantra has been applied as a green initiative by the hotel management. However, there is big difference between eco friendly practices & cutting corners in the name of the environment.   At Rs. 8500 per room per night, I do not see any excuses for ratty, ragged towels, sub standard toiletries or hard uncomfortable mattresses. The bed linen bordered on the unacceptable & was worn & tired.   The rooms had no fans or AC's.

Located at close distance uphill from the Anasakti Ashram, it is enveloped in the pristine beauty of the mountains.The open expanse, lush lawns and cooing of the birds around you will soothe your senses like nothing else can. The best part- People staying elsewhere get up early and go to places like 'Sunrise point' and 'Sunset point'. There is absolutely no need to do this here.

The resort located at the end of a cliff with only a few more houses below it is on a leased property and is built out of wood and clay.
