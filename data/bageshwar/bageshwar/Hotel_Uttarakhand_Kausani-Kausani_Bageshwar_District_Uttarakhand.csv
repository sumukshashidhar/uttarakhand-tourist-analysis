Tea, coffee, hot water, food anything. 3) Although they do not have their own restaurant, they will get you the food from a restaurant across the street. The food is good ( Do not expect 5 star quality or variety, but they do the best they can with Indian veg food).

One can either see a part of the sun rise from the comfort of your bed, or can see the entire range from chairs and sofas on the verandah, The rooms are comfortable and well furnished, but a bit cramped. Maybe that's because the bathrooms are huge, as long as the bedrooms, and almost as wide! I wonder what the architect was thinking of? Lack of maintenance creates problems like wardrobes that don't open or TV sets which don't work because the remote is lost. The other issue is that the food comes from a linked Garden Restaurant across the road, which is irritating if its very cold or raining.

Very friendly and helpful staff and a good restaurant. It's a budget place so be warned - there's no heating in the rooms but it is was surprisingly warm in bed. And it was clean. The 'luxury' rooms have unlimited hot water in an enormous bathroom. The location and helpfulness of the manager and staff make up for its shortcomings. We were given a great itinerary with a walk to a waterfall and a visit to an ancient Hindu temple. It's worth staying here for the tranquility and beauty.,phyllsak,/Profile/phyllsak,"Sydney, Australia",40
bageshwar,Hotel Uttarakhand offers fantastic view of Kausani but it lacks comfort that needed to enjoy this view. Property/Rooms are old fashioned &  needs urgent renovation. Further it's at one end where u cannot freak out coz there's nothing to see nearby except Kausani Post Office or 3-4 small shops. Better be avoided. Main market area is near Hotel Heritage &  nearby.

Although the weather during my stay did not offer great mountain views, the hotel sits atop the ridge-line and offers a clear view over the valleys below towards the Himalayas. In clear weather the view from the hotel would be fantastic. The rooms are of decent size, but are getting a little run-down and in need of some attention. Take note that there is no heat in the hotel and nights can get pretty chilly as you are up in the mountains. The bed was comfortable enough though, and despite some power-outages, the bathrooms do have hot water.",Pjsalt,/Profile/Pjsalt,"Monroe, Connecticut",30
bageshwar,Hotel Uttarakhand in Kausani is a nice place to stay while travelling in the area. There are nice and clean rooms there. The room rate was at a good price and all the rooms there including my own face towards the Himalayas. There is free Wi-Fi available and also a tv inside the room along with a clean bathroom. The staff is relaxed and also friendly. Kausani is a very small village and the hotel is a five minute walk from the centre where there are restaurants. The hotel does offer room service from the restaurant located across the street but it is very overpriced. All things considered I would say this is a decent budget hotel.,Pankaj_Purohit683,/Profile/TheTravelersCup,"Jaisalmer, India",40

Hotel is a great base from which you have opportunity to explore this beautiful and quiet city. Restaurant of the hotel provided delicious North Indian food for all three time.

The hotel is located in  a quiet & scenic place within walk able distance from the market(five to seven minutes).The main attraction of this hotel is an excellent roadside  garden restaurant.Perhaps this is the best place for tourists  looking for good food(Indian & Chinese cuisine) in Kasusani.,saikatashraf,/Profile/saikatashraf,"Kolkata, India",30

You can have a very beautiful view of Himalayan ranges during sunrise from your room itself. It has a good restaurant just adjacent to gate. Rooms are of medium size but good enough for small family. Hot water was available throughout the day. Cleanliness was good. Best Value for Money,SDK11,/Profile/SDK11,Pune,40

Located close to Kausani Market but still secluded from traffic. Great location , you can sit in Gallery and watch entire Himalayan range without any disturbance, Garden Restaurant serves excellent food round the clock and great place to dine espcially on relaxed evenings. Also has small library with good collection ,which you can select . Staff is helpful , suggest that thery should upgrade  TV to LCD 's for better experiencce.   Additionally , they are now managing another property ""Milam Inn"" at Munsiyari which another great place with better viewing rooms , as journey from Kausani to Munsiyari is quite long suggest that they should work our package",ufo007,/Profile/ufo007,mumbai,40

We will find side view of mountain & valley from the common front balcony. For full view of valley + himalaya, we have to go to the watch tower - 200 meters away with 50+ stairs.

Its location, just walking distance from the small local market also adds to its overall attractiveness.   The service experience at the hotel was a mixed bag. The blankets and the bedsheets in the room were not clean and the staff was not exactly professional. One call to the manager though changed all of that promptly. The staff changed all the linen, towels, bed sheets and blankets in the room and even swept and dusted the entire room again.

We planned on staying for only one or two nights and ended up staying an entire week because of Vipin's excellent nature hikes and his personal knowledge of the beautiful surrounding landscape.

They have their own bakery which is very good. Very well located for senic beauty. Specially the sunrise, sunset and the mighty Himalayan glaciers. Namely Trishul and Nanda Devi.

Certainly calls for a morning &evening sitting with the family. Food available in the nearby resturant is also good. The best part is they have every dish available written their menu card which is rare in hills. Due to limited availability of rooms, one need to book a room in advance. The only thing I did not like about the rooms is ( Stayed in room No. 109), ventilation is not good. one can not keep the windows open at night as their is no jali (wire mesh) on the windows.

Also the position of the hotel is such that you can see the sun rise and sunset and also the Himalayas from your room, no need to come to the verandah.  The only problem is that the verandah is common, so lacks privacy, you have big windows in the room but can't keep the curtains open as people move back and forth the verandah.
