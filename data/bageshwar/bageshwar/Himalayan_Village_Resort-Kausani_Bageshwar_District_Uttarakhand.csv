bageshwar,"Good resort but need lot of improvement, still under improvement phase. Owner & staff was good , food was also good. Facilities like washrooms & delivery time was not good.

bageshwar,I visited Kausani with a with a group of friends to celebrate a friend's birthday! We wanted to have an offbeat birthday celebration and zeroed in on Kausani after going through some other options.I am glad that we picked kausani.This place is amidst tea gardens and has beautiful tiny cottages and the best part about this place is that its got a beautiful himalayan view! one can just sit and gaze at the majestic himalayas for hours and still not get bored.The resort was quite clean and the service was good too but the food wasnt that great! But overall a good place and i would definitely suggest people to visit!,Biman21,/Profile/Biman21,"New Delhi, India",40
bageshwar,"The hotel is well away from markets and civilization, very peaceful band serene place. It has all the basic facilities, phone and your 3g works perfectly so you don't get turned off from the world. The staff is courteous and all requests are attended to immediately. The hotel has TV's with DTH so you receive tv most of the time.  The view is absolutely amazing and an overall peaceful environment to relax and enjoy. We did also get a glimpse of snow covered himalayas even though it was early october.  The owner is present at the resort for all your concerns and all staff employed are polite and rush to serve you.  If you want to relax and have a peaceful couple of days, this is the place for you.",209karan,/Profile/209karan,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
bageshwar,The hotel is amazing and the service is very good too. The view of the tea estates is awesome and the owner of the place is a very helpful person. The food is also very good. All in all a great experience.,Abhinav S,/Profile/AbhinavS712,,50
bageshwar,"Went there in Dec'12 with family ( 2 adults and 2 children ). The room we got had a standard double bed and then a bunker bed that easily accommodated the children. We found the whole setup rather cute, but cramped. Overall, the resort itself is set in a limited space and the configuration does not have the feel of a hotel or resort; it feels more like a transit home.  All the rooms in the property have direct view of the Himalayas. If you get up well before sunrise and draw aside the curtains,you will find the peaks assuming different hues every 5 minutes till the sun is fully up. This is an experience not to be missed, and there is absolutely no need to go to the overcrowded 'sunrise point' to enjoy this.  Room service is excellent, courtesy a one-man army called Darshan.

bageshwar,"Idyllic settings with idiotic services - is how this place can be best described . Beautiful view of the Nanda Devi but marred by unhygienic food, mattresses , towels . Electricity is literally a shot in the dark . Not a family or couple destination but if you are a Hell's angel or backpacker on a shoe string and have no qualms on food, bedding and power - you can give it a try .",Trippinginluxury,/Profile/Trippinginluxury,"Sydney, Australia",30
bageshwar,"Please do not go to this place in Summer. We went there in June and it was roasting. The day time temp touched almost 45C. On top, the hotel is designed for winter stay. The cottages were very hot during day time. There is no proper power back up. Every 1 hour the generator was switched off for 30mins, making it really uncomfortable.   The view from the room and the hotel is really nice. The location is also good. But this hotel is not suited for a summer stay.",bongs,/Profile/Bong_Traveller2012,"New Delhi, India",20
bageshwar,"With the change of owner this hotel is renamed as HIMALAYAN Village Resort from the earlier “Kausani Village Resort”. We took the family cottage (which is the first structure when you enter the property). It is big and spacious. Two floors, on the ground it has a large sofa, a small table and LCD TV, climb up the wooden stairs (about 12 of them), you have the bed. Our two small kids between 4-6 were traveling with us, so we asked for an extra bed, but they put two mattresses on the top floor which was extremely comfortable for us. The balcony overlooks the tea garden with amazing views and the bird life which could be seen from the balcony is overwhelming. Very good service, reasonable priced home style food. We found it very helpful food being served to us in our cottage in the",AbhishekNDelhi,/Profile/AbhishekNDelhi,"New Delhi, India",50
bageshwar,"We booked a cottage in this resort over phone from Delhi for 2 days.13th and 14th Feb. They arranged a taxi for us for delhi-kausani-delhi. We started early in the morning and were supposed to reach the resort within 10-12 hrs. They ensured us that the driver knows the roads of Uttarakhand,knows the road to resort and is a very nice person. But unfortunately he was a very grumpy amateur. And I doubt if he ever left Delhi!! He cant even read the road signs. I had to guide him the whole way!! He took sooo many wrong turns and made our milage higher and higher(we pay per mile) !! and he knows nothing about hill driving!!After so much time and difficulty and bad driving, he managed to reach Ranikhet just before midnight!We had to halt there for the night.Next afternoon,after again",TasiraS,/Profile/TasiraS,"Oslo, Norway",30
