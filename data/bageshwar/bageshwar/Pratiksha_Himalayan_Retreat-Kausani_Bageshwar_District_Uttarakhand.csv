The rooms provide excellent views provided the skies are clear in the April month where there are few showers. However I am told that after monsoon, between the months of September onwards the views are supposed to get even better as the skies are clearer.  The staff is extremely responsive, and the food served is very tasty. The Wi-Fi connection was a really spotty and the only downer in our very enjoyable two day stay here.

bageshwar,I booked a room for two nights in May at Pratiksha based on Trip Advisor reviews. It was rated well thereon. When we reached the general upkeep was little shaby but they upgraded our room. And what a bonanza that was we realised once we reached the room. Not knowing we had booked a deluxe room which was on the back side but they upgraded us to super deluxe which had a direct view of the snow peaks from the big window. So this was a big plus as Kausani is known for snow views and we would have been miserable staying in a room with no view. The story of this hotel is like this. Super in parts then let down on few things. Super deluxe room was great but house keeping average. Service was good but food was very average. Our foray into chinese food was a disaster here.

bageshwar,"I have visited Kausani in October 2012 with my family and stayed in Pratiksha. Thanks to all the travelers for their reviews as we have found the retreat exactly what we have wanted. A really calm place with all modern amenities. The rooms are very clean and spacious and the best part of the rooms are the majestic 180 degree views of Himalayas. The Trishul, Nanadadevi and many other peaks you can see from your bed only. We have seen magnificent sunrises from our room only and fortunate enough to view all the peaks with clear skies. Foods are good and they have varieties enough. Kausani is a place for nothing to do and if you love nature and want to spend a day or two to rejuvenate your mind you can stay here.",Ayanbhattacharya,/Profile/Ayanbhattacharya,"Chandannagar, India",40
bageshwar,I visited Kausani with family and stayed in Pratiksha.  I have selected this place to stay based on reviews in in TRIP ADVISOR.  THank you for all the fellow travellers who have written candid reviews. Thanks Pratiksha to make my stay memorable. Its like dream come true... as one of the fantasy that I was having in my mind to have a morning tea in the balcony having view of Snow peaks and that come true in Kausani. Hotel is so well located that you will feel to touch the snow peaks from the room itself. All the rooms were very well located to get the snow peak views. Food was excellent. Roof top restaurant was memorable. Thanks to manager MR. GAJENDRA MEHRA and his team for making our stay memorable.,unmesh_kulkarni59,/Profile/unmesh_kulkarni59,"Mumbai, India",50

I specially visited it's room to and decided that I will stay there next time. The special benefit, you need not to go out side to see the sunrise, you can see it from your room itself. Let me share some useful info as well - >Once you reach Kausani, on the 1st crossing, take the way to Chaukori, within 3-4 min you will see a nice Resort at your left side that is Pratiksha. >After discount, they were offering room around 2500 to 3000/-",BKS70,/Profile/BKS70,Noida,40

The rooms are spacious and had big balconies from were you can enjoy the beauty of the snow clad peaks which looks so near. The hotel staff is very friendly. The rooms are well maintained. The food is good. The dinning hall is beautiful.  This hotel is an ideal place to spend a few days without even venturing outside, because of the spectacular view from the room.

As a hotel there are a lot of things that can be bettered but from the perspective of a visitor who just wants to ""do nothing"" this is the perfect place.   No shopping, no where to go except for an idyllic walk on the winding mountain roads. Baijnath temple (12 km) and Tea estate (2 km) are the only places to visit.  Must try the Kumaoni food.

bageshwar,"A disclaimer to start with. We could not see the famous snow peaks from our mountain view hotel rooms at Kausani. That would have added the extra magic. After the three hour tedious drive from Nainital, the first impression of the hotel is not too encouraging. But later you will realize, you have parked the car on the rooftop and the hotel is actually down below. Manager Mr. Gajendra Mehra will welcome you at the reception desk and will politely tell you summer may not be the best time to view the snow peaks. Rooms are ok, clean. But the service is less than sufficient. When we checked in there were no towels in the washrooms of either of 201 and 202.  The food is tasty but lacks variation.

We had requested for morning call which was missed. Our request to have breakfast on terrace was turn down politely. ÔÅä  Food: Food was good. It was simple and rightly priced.
