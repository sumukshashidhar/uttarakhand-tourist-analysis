bageshwar,Our stay in Himavadi resort was for 3 nights and I definitely must say it has been one of the best resorts I've stayed so far. The behaviour of the staff and the owner himself is excellent. Food served there is pretty good and hygienic. Staff behaviour is also good. The view from the rooms are excellent. We stayed at the cottages and they gave us the best view of the mountain ranges.Room is very clean . After one night of stay in the cottage we had shifted to the suite room cause it was a large one and my full family could fit into it. The rooms behind might not provide you with the view but they have a balcony which also gives a good view of the various ranges. The owner of the hotel is really helpful and is always ready to cater to the needs of the travellers. The sunrise and,Mobile821590,/Profile/Mobile821590,,40

bageshwar,"Nice hotel,great position, to be specific ,the Best position to see the himalayas from the room  & veranda with no obstuction in front.The position is so unique that the view of himalayas can't be obstructed by any means in near future. The hotel authorities are very cooperative ,they 'll knock u at 5:00 am to get a glipse of sunrise & himalayas only if the sky is clear,else they will not disturb u.The Garden Restaurant(separate restaurant in front of the hotel)situated in front of the hotel 'll give u foods whose taste will linger in ur tongue for years to come.",ARITRARAY,/Profile/ARITRARAY,"Kolkata, India",40
