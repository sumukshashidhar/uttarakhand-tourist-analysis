bageshwar,It was a wonderful experience with Sterling... Great hospitality.. Yummy food... Cleaniness... The ambience was very good.. Room location facing the mountains was good. We were treated like a family  Everything was up to the mark.. 10/10..,Ankurjain,/Profile/Ankurjain356,,50
bageshwar,"We stayed here for two nights in studio rooms. Rooms are well equipped with oven, room heaters, and electric heaters. Bathrooms are spacious but they need to creat a dry space in the washroom.  You get a nice view of lush green valley from the room window and one can spend hours in the balcony enjoying the view. Hotel staff are humble well behaved and they provide a good quality and quick room service. There is 24 hours hot water supply. Food is good but it is quite pricier. Lots of parking space available.  Cons: They have just one elevator which is just available in main building. Everyone including the staff use this elevator for moving the luggage to other floors.   As the property is spread across a wide area it becomes a problem when you have aged people with you. They do",Nitish Kanetkar,/Profile/kanetkarji,"New Delhi, India",40

Pros: 1. Rooms are clean & spacious 2. Location is in outskirts Nainital 3. View from the room is good but depending upon the season you visit 4. Food is good  Cons: 1. Very small property to call it a resort 2. Staff is good but should have been more engaging because this property is 7 km from Nainital Mall road and there are very limited activities to do within the so-called resort. 3. TT, Ludo, Caroom is free but rest Billiard, PS4 is chargeable even for the sterling members. 4.

I travelled with my family (total 4PAX) and I was given a premier room, supposedly superior room than classic one. When we reached there, they had allotted the property very far from the main building, and it was very secluded.

The only issue was the food they served, as my wife and kid fell sick and puked atleast 3 to 4 times during that night. While checking out, I witnessed a couple narrating the same issue to the manager and the chef. They were also mentioning about hair and plastic in the food.

Since i started checking-in my bad experience has started.  1. The restaurant folks are so lazy except one guy names Mahender who finally arranged food for us in 1 hr from the time we ordered.  2. We were shifted to our premium studio rooms where in the doors/sink were needing maintenance.  3. It is 7 KM away from Nainital hence if u want to get into Mall road or lakeside then they offer a pickup/drop facility in 1100/- which is too costly.  4. To do born fire one needs to pay 5000/- rupees +tax. This made me feel worse.

Rooms are large and spacious, hot water available throughout, efficient heating (luckily not charged separately).  Check in and check out-a breeze Food quality-reasonable though can be improved. Large, well laid out dining area. The one deficiency is that it is quite a distance from the mall etc and nothing available nearby. Perhaps the hotel can think of some pick-up/drop facility between the hotel and mall. That will greatly improve its acceptability. Also, the hotel name is not clearly visible from the main road. We almost missed it! The name board should be prominent. One big irritant is the so-called games room (billiards/table",Ramani-Coimbatore,/Profile/Ramani-Coimbatore,"Coimbatore, India",40

First of all, this hotel is not situated in Nainital although they intentionally mislead tourist by their name i.e. Nainital Sterling Holiday Resort to fall in their trap. For every small thing you will have to travel at least 7-8 km each side. Anything you want to do it inside the hotel you will have to pay out exorbitant charges extra, nothing mentioned about such on their website. Room heaters are so small that you would never feel their existence and hotel won't provide one more even if you are dying of cold.

bageshwar,"I would say this place is better than to stay at Mall Road, unless you are staying in Manu Maharani. USP of this place is that it's away from crowd and all rooms have Valley view. So following are my ratings :  Food : Excellent but expensive.  Hospitality : Excellent and do not forget to meet F&B Manager ""Pradeep"" He is a nice person and will always be available to hear your feedback.   Staff : Good.  Only thing I can point out to Management would be regarding the walls which are not as thick as it should be. LOL.. you might hear all kind of notices from other rooms crystal clear.

Two of the great employees who continue to work there for their care are Chef Shukla and Jitender who work in the restaurant and provided us with amazing service. They both continued to make sure we were satisfied with our food as well as gave us tips on touring the city.They would often come to check on our food/comfort in the restaurant and served us portions of their specialty. In-fact they packed food for us when we used to step out for sight seeing. This kind of hospitality is surely unmatched with other of hotels.

Being on main road  and away from city you need cab every time you go out. Nothing is nearby. No shops but a few residences are there. For cab you have to depend upon hotel people with the obvious pitfalls associated. Bhowali a small town is almost 4 kms. It could have been a much better location though further away.  Nearest Raiwayl Station is KathGodam about 35 kms and  LalKuan 60 kms.Roads to the hotel are good. Main building is just on road has Reception at Road level Floor 3rd. Then you go down.

Well one has to cross the traffic snarl of mall road on to bhowali road to reach to this resort which is approx 5-6 Km towards bhowali.  The property is on the road side where the rooms are facing a valley providing a good view from your room. It's a newly constructed hotel with neat and clean rooms, though the toiletries are very average. The disappointment was not so humble staff and a very unprofessional guest service. The food is over priced for the guests as well as for the members. Though the buffet is served with variety of dishes but the taste is again not so good. Evening snacks and servings are again disappointing. It's more of a commercialized resort with less focus on guests hospitality.",VINAY B,/Profile/vinaybhalla17,Kaithal,30

Hygiene is a big issue with the property with dust on the floor, tables and chairs, stained and old towels and hair on the sheets. Hygience sense of the staff is completely missing.

It has amenities like pool table, spa, carom board, etc. This place is around 6 kms from mall road at a very quite place. Only annoying thing is that hotel charges you a bomb for a drop or a pick to /from mall road. Rs. 500 + taxes just for a 6km drop.  So it will cost u around Rs. 1100 just for one trip to mall road.

Besides taxis, there are buses and share taxis to travel from Nainital to this resort. The buses and share taxis stop right outside the resort gate at Jhokia. The resort has its own good parking lot, which is good for those driving up in their own cars, especially in the peak season, when parking in the hotels in Naintal town, becomes an acute problem.  As the resort is on a road that goes through a thick forest, we were warned not to walk out on the road by ourselves after dark, for fear of leopards.

Be it quiet walks in the pine covered hills or a barbecue on a spectacular terrace.  The minor distance from the main nainital town allows ease of access and parking. The staff lead by Mr Sougato is very helpful, friendly and enthusiastic. The food is excellent, we tried both Indian and continental. The place is like a home-away-from home. The service is prompt but non-intrusive. The décor and colour theme is different for each room, so its often better to choose a room that suits your mood.
