The restaurant was quite spacious and the dinner being a la carte was served witin reasonable time. tasty food. the buffet breakfast was nicely laid and was sumptous.  pick and drop facility to mall road was available free of cost. overall a nice experience.,Suhail Rafat,/Profile/suhailrafat,"New Delhi, India",50
bageshwar,While planning my second visit to Nainital I was sure to book my stay in Manu Maharani after hearing lot about it. The wait staff room service etc are unmatchable. During our stay there were guests from a wedding staying back hence the hotel seemed full and thus the reception seemed quite busy. We weren’t offered any welcome drink. The property seemed well maintained except the garden. They provide shuttle service to and from the mall road which is good but surely has specific operating hours. I was expecting better views of the lake.  In all it was a comfortable stay.,Abhi5684,/Profile/Abhi5684,"Jaipur, India",40

Room Service is Decent.   Location:: 1. Manu Maharani is a bit uphill from Walking Street (Mall Road).

bageshwar,all the hillstations apart from nainital now have 5 star hotels for one the big hotel chains.this is the best one in nainital. this hotel has nice location with good view of the lake and the whole city. it still has the old charm of hill stations. the rooms are average with very basic bathrooms(can be done much better with better showers and faucets). the service from the local staff is outstanding but with some very senseless rules by the management.(being a hill station they should at least have sigdi's in the evening whereas it is chargeable) the food is nice here but with very limited menu but u don't really feel it as the mall road has ample amount of restaurants and is super close to the hotel. ,sahejdeep singh,/Profile/sahejdeepsingh,,40
bageshwar,"I fell in love with a city last month, and that city is Nainital. I knew it was love at first sight when I stepped out onto my large terrace at the Manu Maharani Hotel and gazed down through the trees to the lake. My five nights at the Manu Maharani could not have been better, but the great service started many weeks before my arrival. Manager Rahul Pande and Travel Desk Coordinator Sayema Khan answered my many emails promptly and efficiently as I required a few changes to my reservation and also needed a car and driver for longer distances on several occasions. Do yourself a favor and book a terrace room- there are only four and they are very popular, so book early. In these you have a gorgeous view and a lovely covered swinging picnic table that is perfect for that afternoon",ShahrukhKhanFan,/Profile/ShahrukhKhanFan,"Miami Beach, Florida",50

The price that we paid 17,000 a night was for a duplex - two beds, TINY bathroom (barely space to stand) + breakfast and dinner. The sheets were pristine clean, all amenities that are associated with a five star were available. 36 hours worth of wifi was included in our pkg but it barely worked.

The toilet were like public toilets in Nainital and support and helpful staff at front desk and outside were so good that I wanted my refund of 50% amount paid at the time of booking.  Actually the policy of 50% advance is for this that people won't run away after seeing the standard of the rooms. As per front desk manager this hotel is due for renovation which was last done in year 2000. Just one good thing is the helpful staff at the restaurants.  And mind it the kid size bed is not bigger then queen size of other hotels and if you have kids just make sure to ask for complimentary bed at the time of booking else be ready to pay Rs 2200,Sumitsal,/Profile/Sumitsal,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",10

My parents along with 3 other couples were suppose to stay in this hotel for 4 nights but had such a BAD experience that they had to cut short the stay after 2 nights.  1. First of all, the air conditioners weren't working in the rooms, even after repeated requests they didn't do anything about it. Only ones in public areas were working. 2.The bed in the room were in a really bad condition, one of the couples had to get the mattress changed!!!  3.

bageshwar,"1. As told by Mr. Singh on behalf of the hotel, this property was previously a Maharani's(Queen) estate and to commemorate her, the hotel has been named after her. The hotel is run by a hospitlaity group based in Delhi. 2. Considering the fact that it is a hill station, the property is worth a five-star rating. 3. It is slightly away from the hustle bustle of the main town which is probably what you need in a vacation. 4. Entrance and lobby both are impressive and dining areas are good. 5. Rooms excel in all the expected criterias but toiletries should have been more luxurious. 6. Attentiveness and courtesy of the staff is excellent as noted by everyone else. 7. Free wifi is available only in lobby which was not ideal though we specifically did not have a problem with that. 8.",SjAwadh,/Profile/SjAwadh,"New Delhi, India",50

A more polite way would have been to tell us that they have made arrangements in the other restaurant. And in the package restaurant we were surprised to see a Long quee of guests for buffet.

bageshwar,This review is based on our tip to the property in OCT 2012.  I was looking for the best property in Nainital to celebrate our 10th Wedding Anniversary and our Son’s (6 year) first visit to any Hill station.  And I must say I spent days in searching for hotel and reading the reviews of Guests before I finalised this hotel . Once we reached there – I realised it was worth taking the pain. Hotel Property is good. We booked room with private Terrace and view was amazing.  Hotel staff was good . Great food .  Their General Manager took personal interest in each guest and kept track of how we are every day .  What else can I say – till today my Son remembers that trip and says whenever we plan next trip to another city – it should be exactly same as Manu Maharani.

Its location in the midst of market is an added advantage although the traffic congestion on the way gets on your nerves.

bageshwar,We stayed at this hotel during our trip to Corbett and Nainital. We wanted best hotel in Nainital and our travel agent Classic Taj Tours suggested this hotel. It turned out to be the best in town. This hotel has very good room having direct view of Naini Lake. If you have small kid then you will find its bed a bit smaller. Its garden and lawn is beautifully laid out. Hotels staff were good and prompt. Their food was good with lots of varities and specially buffet dinner with DJ is not to miss.  Over all this is the best option in Nainital but value to cost is in negative side.,FreakyTraveller16,/Profile/FreakyTraveller16,Delhi,40

I booked a 3 days/2 nights package, buffet breakfast and dinner was included, the taste, varity and quantity of food was good. they also had their own vehicle to have a sight seeing trip. had a decent stay there but its little overpriced and may be the most expensive hotel in nainital.",Inspire.vs,/Profile/Virat1988,"Stuttgart, Germany",40

bageshwar,Why did we pay top buck and booked in advance only to find ourselves in a overrated and overpriced hotel in Nainital? I fail to find an answer! I guess it could be for lack of better options in Nainital.  We anticipated a star category experience when we paid top bucks to stay at ‘The Manu Maharai’ at Nainital. Checking in on Sunday for two nights stay we were told that we could get our promised lake-facing room in the evening (when the sun is down and very little chance to see the lake). It took almost a fight with the Manager to get us a lake facing room after two hours of checking in. Had to argue that we wernt on any ‘wait-list’ and loosing one day our of two means rather too much asking in guise of our ‘co-operation’.  Room we did get – only to find ourseleves on a ‘stiff’,Bombayite,/Profile/Bombayite,"Mumbai, India",20

The rooms are spacious and well maintained. All rooms have an exceptional view of the Nainital lake.   It is located not to far off from the mall road, and you wouldn't miss any action. The disco is one of its 'hot-spots', which would very often attract young boys and girls from numerous boarding schools that Nainital has.

The food is great but would suggest to eat at their restaurant as the room service is extremely slow, the food becomes cold by the time it reaches the room.  The hotel offers a great view of the lake and is located at a very serene location.  They arrange for boat rides as well as horses but the charges on the higher side. Would suggest to book them directly and not through the hotel.  Overall a nice place to stay. Can stay again.",tanumanu,/Profile/tanumanu,"Ghaziabad, India",40

We decided to stay at Manumaharani since it was recommended by my mother who had stayed there earlier.  Rooms : We stayed at a club room since we were very particular about a balcony. Even though it was more expensive , it was worth it. The experience of sipping hot tea in the balcony with the lights of Nainital around us and the stars above was unforgettable. The rooms were contemporary with part wood and part marble flooring. It was equipped with a large sized LCD TV , coffee maker and refrigerator. The bathroom was a little small but was fitted with modern fittings.
