Starting with an adventurous walk and 2 river crossings (easy) we arrived at the property which is small but artistically designed. Nestled between mountains on 3 sides and flanked by a river its the most idealistic place to unwind and be yourself while the river sings the song that soothes your senses that have been distorted by the mad city life. It's all about the details... the way the rooms are interestingly designed by leading architects from Delhi with rural accents, large sizes, large windows, bukhari, the list is endless.

But, considering each room costed us Rs. 17000 per night, including breakfast and dinner, the quality of the rooms and upkeep of the property should have been better.

The only drawback is that the property is not directly accessible by road and therefore not meant for the faint-hearted. You have to hike upto the property for almost 30-45 mins.

bageshwar,"If there is one place I am going back to......it is this!   The half an hour trek to get to the ""hansel and gretel"" like cottage is what fairytales are made of! going over the rocks....wading through knee deep water......and being assisted by the excellent staff is an awesome experience.  The rooms are nothing to write home about but the personal assistance of the hotel manager and the courtesy of the staff makes all the difference!  And the star gazing in the night is another  high altogether!  For all the nature lovers out there....this place is a must must visit.   The small children have to be given some  special attention, not much to do for them unless they have great company. But the sights all around more than make up for any other shortcomings........",indianholiday3,/Profile/indianholiday3,india,50
bageshwar,"If you are looking for some time away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, Chanfi is the place to go to. It's a short drive from the Kathgodam station and about a 15-30 minute trek from the road, depending on your state of fitness. Fortunately the property has staff who transport your baggage.   You walk through a valley as you get off the road and suddenly you find you have arrived at Soulitude. The accommodations are cottage style, with typically two rooms in each cottage - upstairs and downstairs. I was pleased to find myself in a downstairs suite as it had an outdoor open-to-sky bathing area as well as being a little cooler than the upstairs room.   The staff are amazing and really looked after us. The meals were excellent as were the chai and the chaas. this is a",Sudeep B,/Profile/SudeepB980,Chandigarh,50

It is right at the banks of a River so you hear the sound of water rushing by all day. If the current is not too strong you can take a dip in the river too, as we did much to the delight of the kids.

A very exciting yet an easily manageable walk indeed!  On our arrival at the resort we were greeted by the staff and a very interesting welcome drink called ""chaas"" a tantalising version of buttermilk with a mint flavour.  We were then taken on a mini tour of the resort which is splendidly landscaped yet has a rustic look to it. The property is endowed with captivating natural beauty. It is surrounded by hillocks on three sides and a small stream flowing through the it with natural waterfalls very imaginatively conceived.

One could never imagibe that in the middle of nowhere, down in the valley such a beautiful property can exist, that also right next to a river. We trekked down the hill to reach this property which was an amazing experience and once you reach you are truly speechless. The first thing you want to do is go and take a quik dip in the river - it is so inviting. The rooms are so nicely done up with so much attention to detail.

We went there for a day trip as we were already staying at soulitude in the Himalayas. After reaching there we were so mesmerized that we insisted on staying there for the night even though they had not opened up for lodging yet. The river touches the property with its own private waterfall. So tempting that even though it was ice cold we actually got into the water. Had lunch served next to it and very delicious food and great service. The place lives upto it's name. Solitude, serenity and calm. The location is unbeatable.

Whenever I have been to a hill station I enjoyed, but, Souitudeprovides you the real experience of staying in the hills. View and feel of the place is very close to a dream.   Here, you actually stay in the hills. While lying on your bed all you can hear to is the voice of birds chirping, river flowing and when you step in the balcony its different world altogether. There is a small trek which leads to Soulitude by the riverside. Food is lip-smacking. Staff is very nice and polite. Rooms offer a spectacular view and are nicely done with an ethnic touch.

However, a trip to Soulitude by the Riverside changed my perception, and how! Perched on the banks of a river (Kalsa) and guarded on 3 sides by mountain cliffs, this extensively-thought-through and lovingly created property which appears mirage-like after a fun trek, exists harmoniously with its beautiful natural surroundings and boasts of a private waterfall (no less!), spectacular views, offering a rustic yet extremely comfortable stay and makes for the perfect getaway from the maddening crowd.
