bageshwar,Good location. Good design but the management is bad and the staff terrible. We had bad stay. The rooms are not clean and the staff untrained and rude and also they let in some bad people into the hotel late in the night when we stayed,Uttamghosh,/Profile/Uttamghosh,"Mumbai, India",10
bageshwar,"We stayed in the hotel for four nights. Though the staff was friendly and helpful, there was no senior supervisor available and the hotel was being run at the level of room boys and the cook. Four rooms, which have been constructed recently, did not have an exhaust fan or proper drainage for rain water.",Pradeep K,/Profile/678pradeepk,"Noida, India",30
bageshwar,On our way back from Munsiyari we took a night halt at Kausani and stayed at this hotel. It is still adding more rooms and facilities and currently in expansion stage. Good location a bit away from the main town and close to Tea Gardens and open fields. One does not get the views of snow peaked Mountains from this side of Kausani but at the same time it is more serene and peaceful.,Sudhir Kalra,/Profile/SudhirK260,"New Delhi, India",40
bageshwar,"The rooms were very huge. In fact, I was quite surprised to see the size of the rooms for the price we were paying. The washrooms were also big and clean. The view from the terrace is amazing. The staff arranged for a bonfire for us at night at a minimal extra cost(Rs.400). The food they cooked for dinner tasted very homely. The exteriors of the hotel are not very appealing, but otherwise it's a great place. The only problem we faced was that the washrooms don't have geysers, and it can sometimes get quite cold up here. The staff does provide heated water on request, but it can be a bit of a hassle. However, since we were in Kausani only for a day, this didn't bother us much.",Divya T,/Profile/divyat123,"Lohardaga District, India",40

bageshwar,"This is one of the best hotel in Kausani. We had called earlier for the bookings of Rudraksh Palace and the guy assured us of the best service to us and we were not disappointed. When we entered the room, we were offered the fruits and tea-coffee. The guy were with us all during our stay. We were a group of 13 people including senior citizens. There were few steps we had to climb down to reach our room. One of my uncle was having difficulty in climbing down the steps. The staff carried him to his room. This was the kind of service. The food was also excellent. In the morning, in the breakfast, we were offered all kinds of foods and variety of service. The best part of the hotel is its view. The location was excellent. In the morning at 5:30, when we woke up, there were clouds",purvi s,/Profile/Purvi-1,"Ahmedabad, India",50
bageshwar,"We reached Kausani on 21st Dec 2013 at 5 PM. Checked Hotel Pratiksha. Unfriendly staff. Negative vibes. Off season but still the room rates were high. We drove few metres ahead to find this hotel, Rudraksh Palace. There were two guys looking after the place. Good location. Decent food. Excellent service. Very cordial guys. Spoke very politely. Cottage had wooden flooring. Washrooms were clean. Newly built place. I would recommend this to anyone. Rest depends on your taste.
