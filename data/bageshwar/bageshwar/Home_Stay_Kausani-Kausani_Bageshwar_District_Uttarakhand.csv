bageshwar,"After a hectic journey from Olso to New Delhi than drive to Nianital  & Kausani, when we arrived there, we were mesmerized. It's such a beautiful home, so comfortable, so cozy. Full of lovely and helpful people, especially Dinesh. We did a 5 night village walking tour in around Kausani, explore real India, we really enjoy the village waking and home stay. Dinesh is such a nice host, just like a friend. Throughout our stay, we slept well, got home-made food, and got pampered well. From the terrace only you can see Trishuli and another high peaks. It's little far from Kausani, but quite and tranquil place. Dinesh arranged all our village waking tour & temple sightseeing trips. It was a lovely trip because we stayed at Kausani. Thank you Dinesh and team. We will definitely stay",David Wendy,/Profile/Anniemerline,,50
bageshwar,"We had a fantastic experience with the Home stay Kausani. Bhawna she was incredibly responsive via our email exchanges during our planning process and was able to quickly tailor an itinerary for us based on our interests, needs, and travel dates. When we arrived, Bhawna, was there ready at the airport to greet and pick us up, despite our late arrival. Bhawna reviewed our itinerary to make sure everything was accurate, gave us additional contact information should we need it, and checked in with us a few times during our stay to make sure everything was going smoothly. We had very nice driver Mr Singh. He was always safe on the roads and we were never uncomfortable, even though driving in India is little crazy. He went the extra step to walk with us to some of the more confusing",mre61,/Profile/mre61,"Perth, Australia",50
bageshwar,We decided to make a trip to Kumaon Himalaya at the very last minute. We contacted to Kausani Home stay Ms. Bhawna and within minutes (not days!) they were able to put together. This is the excellent.,skhulbey,/Profile/skhulbey,"Bengaluru, India",50
bageshwar,"I stayed at the home stay of Indianhomestays at the end of Nov-early Dec 2015. I chose to go there only because so many reviews described the place as Switzerland of India. I thoroughly disagree with such lofty adjective used for the place. Although, Indianhomestays calls it a home stay, it is really not a home stay, but a 8-10 room hotel, with a balcony offering an excellent view of the Himalayas. The view is so great that it is rather infectious and one does not feel satisfied even after staring at it for hours. It is so relaxing and inspiring to sit and watch the Himalayas.  The hotel room is quite good and self contained with power and all amenities. So in that respect it is not inspiring but a regular hotel room. The tariff includes B/L/D. Service was excellent, may be",453jagdish,/Profile/453jagdish,"Mumbai, India",40
