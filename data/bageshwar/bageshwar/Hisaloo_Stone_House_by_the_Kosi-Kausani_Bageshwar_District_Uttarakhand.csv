bageshwar,"Very helpfull and serviceminded staff. Excellent food which is included. The staff can arrange guided walkings and mountainbiking tours in the sorroundings. A very quiet place also for relaxing. There is a lot of birds around and if you are lucky, you will get a glimpse of a leopard. The rooms are very modern and comfortable with shower and toilet.",Lena R,/Profile/642lenar,"Ringsted, Denmark",40
