bageshwar,"Myself is Surya Tygai, MD of Riva Travel. I stayed at this hotel from 08th June to 10th June. Hotel services are pathetic. Rather there was no water in the washrooms and we had to waited till they resolved the issue.  But the worst was when a local person shouted on me due to some parking issues and when I objected, he started to abuse me and even to my wife. Everything was happening in front of the Kausani Retreat Hotel Management. When he threatened us, we had to call even police and then rectified and checked out in an emergency.   If hotel Management should have intervene, we need not to call police. But there was no support and security from hotel side.  I am since last 21 years in this industry. But never faces this kind of humiliation. I have blacklisted this property and",Surya Tyagi,/Profile/Rivatravel,"Noida, India",10
bageshwar,The normal rooms are very small. What we see in website is very different We have to upgrade the rooms. Upgraded room was ok. But food quality & test are bad. The view from hotel is good.Room service takes much time.,Jayesh Shah,/Profile/Jayeshshah67,,30
bageshwar,"We stayed at this particular hotel for 2 nights. Hotel is at good  with good view but the staffs are not able to maintain it. May be they are overloaded with work. However they were polite and well mannered. The deluxe room was equal to a standard room. The quilt provided did not have covers on it. TV did not work for 2 days, neither they fixed it after complaining nor they had the decency to change the room. Dinner buffet was laid one hour later on the first day. Second day thought of trying room service and ordered for coffee which never came and finally we had to move to the restaurant to have coffee. They have a scope of improvement and a lot to work on internal communications.",Yogesh Bhojwani,/Profile/Byogesh1981,,30

We paid total 100% advance and we had a Horrible food rather. We can have outside. Every curry is full of water. Tasteless, Half boiled rice, Soup rajma everything is full of water. Toilet don;t have geyser. We cooked well than them in our home. They spoiled our kausani stay. Jug was not clean seems they didn't clean it for a year. if anyone use it surely will die. Has algae inside the jug. Net day morning we shifted to another hotel and till today they have not refunded our money. Complained to Ministry of Tourism as well as uttarakhand Tourism also.

bageshwar,Wonderful stay and the staff was really supportive. View from the balcony is extremely beautiful. This hotel is just 50 m from main market. All the places which are worth to explore near the kausani are nearer to this place. Hotel staff Mr. Neeraj was too much supportive and cooperated in all aspects of stay.
