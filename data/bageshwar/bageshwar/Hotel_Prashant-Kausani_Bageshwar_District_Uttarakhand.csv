bageshwar,Urine was spread on the bathroom floor near the washbasins and below the flush. We complain about them but they didn't resolve our problem. Staff Behaviour was so pathetic. Foul odour inside the room and dirty pillow covers and bedsheets. I would prefer never ever to go to this hotel if you don't want to spoil your trip.,pratsarin,/Profile/pratsarin,"Varanasi, India",10
bageshwar,"Service folks are not customer centric, they delay in providing services most of the time, poor room quality, not so great place to stay. Owner is very obsessive.

bageshwar,"Budget hotel..decent stay..great view of the Himalayas. Food can be avoided, hot water by the bucket. It's a no frill hotel worth the cost. The terrace view is something to eye for, avoid terrace room because of disturbance by over excited tourists. People are friendly and helpful nevertheless. ",Vasudev N,/Profile/vasudevn2016,,30
bageshwar,We took two rooms one with the full views of the mountain and the other room was normal. The rooms were average nothing to boast about. The furniture was worn out bathroom had some issues. The view of the mountains from the hotels were excellent. The staff was very helpful especially the manger.,srinjoy2016,/Profile/srinjoy2016,"Kolkata, India",40

Very Friendly room service staff It was the best of our tour.The view of sunrise from the room was ultimate.The hotel is beautifully located on a hill-side and you would get a complete view of the mighty Himalayas from your room.,dip_blk,/Profile/dip_blk,"Jalpaiguri, India",40
bageshwar,"The rooms are very huge and clean. You'll feel very comfortable inside, even if it is freezing outside. The views of the mountain ranges from room windows and from the roof-top are the surprises! Very good location. But the food quality is poor.

bageshwar,"Stayed there on 25-26th September 2015. Rooms were booked online. Somehow , it gave me 45% discount.But when I visited the hotel, the actual tariff was itself low. Tariff online : Rs 1360, So two days = Rs 2720 - 45% Discount = Around rs 1640 Actual Tariff: Rs 950, so two days = Rs 1900  About the hotel, room and the Stay 1: Hotel : Situated at highest point of Kausani hence good Himalayan View. Easily accessible. 2: Room: The highest quality room , what they call Deluxe was not good, not clean or not maintained.  3: Food: Awesome, Delicious. 4: Service: Excellent  Best thing about the hotel: The staff is really courteous. The workers are very hard-working and at the end you feel like tipping them by heart.",Arpit J,/Profile/250arpitj,Noida,30
bageshwar,"Great place to be in.With so many open terrace for full front on view of Mt.TRISHUL, this is an awesome property.The 2 rooms on the smaller terrace are the best in class though the rooms can be much better and decorative. The other deluxe view rooms are ""D-class"" rooms which are also very good and mountain facing. The service is excellent with the ""always ready to help"" Tiwary-ji and the resident bengali cooks prepares awesome food with great taste and pretty good quantity. The price is also quite affordable. Stone throwing distance from Gandhi Ashram. Visited this place during May 17-19 and stayed on 1 of the 2 rooms of the terrace as seen in the picture.",Sabyasachi,/Profile/Sabyasachi1103,"Kolkata, India",40

bageshwar,"We a family of four decided to have a stopover in kausani on the way to delhi while coming from munsiyari. We wanted a decent, budget hotel just from a night halt. The location of the hotel is one of its plus point as, its in walking distance from the ""Anasakti/Gandhi ashram"" in kausani. The views from the rooms ( D3,4) were amazing. It also have some playing area for the kids. Good and courteous staff with excellent room service. Quality of sleep was sound and food was also good but somewhat less in quantity. It seems to be little congested with lots of room built in. But anyhow, I would surely recommend it.",drdb03,/Profile/drdb03,"New Delhi, India",40
bageshwar,We had booked a Deluxe Room for one night stay in Kausani. It is located near to the Gandhi Ashram. The view of Himalayan range from the hotel is spectacular.

bageshwar,"In the month of October 2014 I have visited Kausani with my family and stayed in Hotel Prashant. Location wise it is very good. No regular supply of water in the Bathroom. Only mooring you will find water is coming in the bathrooms. But if you demand then service people can serve you a little. The food quality was good.  Rooms and bathrooms are not just perfect, still oK.",apramanik76,/Profile/apramanik76,"Kolkata, India",20

bageshwar,"Indeed you can expect to get a spectacular view of the Himalayas range from the roof top of the hotel. (provided if you're lucky to get a sunny day in Kausani). Very near to the Gandhi Ashram - the only place to visit in kausani. You would definitely enjoy the peace and scenic beauty of the place.  We visited there in Dec 2012, and it was really chilling in the evening and night and the only discomfort in the hotel was no room heaters were available and the blankets weren't sufficient enough to beat the cold.",Arnab,/Profile/itz_Arnab,"Kolkata, India",40
bageshwar,"I will be short & try to be sweet as well :-)  If you are looking for splendid Himalayan views and if your pocket is not as deep as mine was during the extended Uttaranchal tour- this is your Best Bet at Kausani. Run by a retired army officer, this is more of home stay and less of hotel.   Hotel Prashant is located at the highest point of the hill and it offers the most panoramic view of Himalayas. The room's are are not as clean, the food service is slow, the TV's are old and you wont get any internet or phone facility. Nor does it offer any kind of luxury. But these are certainly not the things we look for when we visit and small hill like this. Especially when you want to pay anything between 500-1000 INR.
