bageshwar,"I visited Hotel sagar on 24th  May 19. tarrif was 2000 for one night with no food included.  hotel room was spacious n clean. towels were washed. but no tooth paste, shampo, lotion, cream was given, In this price range i expect at least basic things. View from hotel was great, nearby star-gate observatory is wonderful, For a early morning show in star-gate at 3:30 am hotel Sagar is best location. Although we did not get a clear sky to see the himalaya  early morning.. but it was fun to rise so early n feel the cool breeze of surroundings.",deepika dangwal,/Profile/deepikadangwal,"Greater Noida, India",30
bageshwar,"Great views of Himalayan ranges. Average hotel otherwise. But, worth the stay just for such an awesome view. We visited it long back, 1996 I think. But, it has been renovated since.  It's a sheer pleasure to just sit on the terrace, sipping tea and enjoying the sunrise and the sunset. ",Upendra Joshi,/Profile/ujoshi67,,40
bageshwar,It is well located and one can see nice view of Himalayan mountains.The employees are nice and courteous.However the cleanliness of the hotel needs a lot of improvement.

bageshwar,"Its a budget hotel, and has one of the best locations for getting good view of the Himalayas. The staff is very cooperative and responsive for providing room service, but that's about it.  The rooms, toilets and linen are not very clean.  One of the room did not have any ventilation in toilet, and smell was coming in the room. Overall, you feel that you are staying in a dingy hotel. Stayed there for a day only. Did not try the food there.   Had dinner and breakfast at Yogi restaurant in Kausani, which is one of the best restaurant in town providing Indian as well as continental meals - freshly made on order - and very economical.",Rahul T,/Profile/rahult661,"New Delhi, India",30

bageshwar,Blankets was very dirty. The manager was very careless. Food quality was not good. Improvement needed.Prices of the rooms were way overpriced. They charged us 4000 for a very small room.And yes I am sure you'll be awake in night because of the azaan which is right near the hotel.,Stay735526,/Profile/Stay735526,,10

bageshwar,"We had chosen this hotel through one of the portals and after looking at the tripadvisor reviews. Seemed like quite an aged property, but the basics were in place. The rooms were neat, clean, toilet had a geyser for 24x7 hot water. Didn't like the towels that seemed a bit dazed.. could have had better. Not all light fixtures were working.  But all the -ve aspects got blown away with the beautiful view from our mountain facing room. Gandhiji's Anashakti Ashram is a 5 min walk across the street. There are a couple of planetorium business nearby that you can explore (we avoided).  Food available in the hotel seemed extremely pricey, as per the menu card and we decided to look out for local food. There's a very hard working husband-wife jodi just outside the entrance who serves",yajnasb,/Profile/yajnasb,"Kolkata, India",30

bageshwar,I was in 126. a corner room on 2nd story. A beautifully located old property. Bathroom not so clean. Reception staff doesn't care to behave properly. On learning that we were coming from Kosi reacted callously-Kosi is a useless place( Kosi bekar hain). In evening at 1915 there were no snacks available but all were busy in a big party dinner arrangements. Luckily some guy came and after tipping took order by almost sitting on my bed and finally brought dinner at 2200 hrs after repeated chasing. I will not recommend this place for single families but only big group travellers as they the infrustructure but lacks eagerness for service.,DevD2020,/Profile/DevD2020,"Durgapur, India",30
bageshwar,Awesome view of Himalayan range from top floor. Food is good. Bed spacious enough for 2 adults and 1 kid. When you enter the room you feel immediately how old the property is. The marbel floor in bathroom has fungus/algae marks. The fittings are also pretty old. Has ample parking and lots of rooms. Food is expensive.,hitesh k,/Profile/hkakarai,"Mumbai, India",40

bageshwar,Have visited kausani in the very first week of January 2017 (3 & 4 Jan). Stayed in Room No 203. Awesome room and view point directly from Room. Each toilet has geyser. Good ambiance. Would suggest to go for this hotel while visiting kausani.,SUMITCEN,/Profile/SUMITCEN,"Kolkata, India",50
bageshwar,"The hotel is located in Kausani town, and is probably one of the biggest with 40 rooms.  I stayed on second floor room (235) which is located at the corner. Room was small but comfortable, geyser is available in every room.  If you want big rooms, rooms facing the parking lot seemed to be the biggest, rooms on second and 3rd floor with balconies have the best view.  Furniture in rooms was outdated and old, TV was not working properly.  Monkeys keep on visiting often is search of food so one needs to keep windows and doors closed.  During night as the hotel was fully occupied, it was extremely noisy and we could hear children running on roof and floors above clearly.  Food at the restaurant takes time to prepare and you have to order 30 mins in advance, it is good and decently",Saurabh S,/Profile/821saurabhs,"New Delhi, India",30
bageshwar,"We throughly enjoyed our stay @ Sagar during Oct'15.  The Rooms were quite comfy providing exciting views of the Himalayan mountain range, especially the Sun-rise & Sun-set was superb.  Service staff were cordial & swift, Food was good.  The Place is in close proximity to SN Pant's cottage and the Gandhij's place, where most the tourists gather for catching the gold-coloured mountains bathed in the light of Sun-rise & Sunset.  Overall, I'd recommend this.",alok K,/Profile/akr0072016,"Noida, India",40

bageshwar,We stayed for a night driving from Nainital via Ranikeet. Good free parking facility. Checking was smooth and ordered tea and promptly served. The hotel is just 5 minutes walk to Gandhi Ashram. The hotel is nicely located to see the sun rise and Himalayan peak view. The dinner and breakfast was freshly prepared and served and tasty also. Morning they gave a call to inform that the sun rise is about to happen and we had a very good view from their terrace. The room view was also good. The room  finishing is ok. The geyser was working. Overall a nice stay.,Baburajapuram,/Profile/Baburajapuram,"Chennai, India",40
bageshwar,This Hotel was like a pit stop just for the watching the Sunrise event which creates Fiery Clouds and Illuminates the Himalayan Peaks. The entire village of Kausani can be seen from Atop this Hotel. No fancy things to do here. Unfortunately the forest fire in Uttarakhand did not give us the Himalayan Glimpse but the Fiery Clouds were worth watching. We were offered a welcome drink which is a local delicacy called Buransh. The staff was also very accommodating. Over all a budget friendly hotel.,Tushar Joshi,/Profile/teejay9009,"Pune, Maharashtra, India",40
bageshwar,"Location of hotel is excellent. You can view sunrise/snowy mountain peaks from most of the rooms as well as from the terrace. We stayed for two nights. On first night of check-in, we were late to reach hotel (11pm). Even though the hotel restaurant was closed, the manager was courteous enough to ask his cooking staff to prepare parathas for us by the time we reach the hotel.

I had a good experience with the hospitality.  One issue, I faced was the staff have some tie up with one f&b outlet just beside the hotel. It has the worst food to serve. We should avoid and the management must have control over their staff to avoid inconvenience to the guest.
