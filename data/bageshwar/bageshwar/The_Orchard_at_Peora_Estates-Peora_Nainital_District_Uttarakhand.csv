The owner (Mr. Bansal) had already connected me to a taxi guy at Kathgodam who was waiting for us when we reached. After a 2 hour journey, we were at The Orchard by breakfast time.   The place is absolutely stunning. Food, staff and property - are all perfect. Perched on a hill, the view of Panchuli range is  breathtaking. In the middle of a village, we found ourselves in the lap of luxury! The staff was extremely polite and catered to every demand of ours.

bageshwar,"Visited The Orchard at Peora estate with close friends, for new years. Top of the world and personalised hospitality and one of the most perfectly architected properties. With a view of the grand Himalayan range from our rooms was absolutely breathtaking, i am a big fan of the food at the orchard. The pahari thali, mexican brunch, Mediterranean dinner with each meal planned in sumptuous courses was just amazing. Their focus on the minutest details just win you over. The badams on your bedside every morning, the haldi shot and fresh juice for the ones who've had a rough night, board games and musical instruments, barsets and glassware, the party speaker at the library bar or the gifts for the girls every morning.

I stayed in the 'Royal Suite' for 2 nights - the whole decor was modern, classy and crisp to a tee. It gives you the true sense of luxury in the middle of Himalayas. The staff was well-trained and I was extremely impressed with their hospitality. It is amazing how they cared about every nitty-gritty requests of their guests. It's the small things that matter. For example - every time we returned to our rooms at night, we would find soaked almonds by our bedside and a hot water bottle in the bed.

From the time I started speaking with Mr Rahul Bansal (the owner of this wonderful villa) over the phone for my booking inquiries, till the time we stayed at the villa, everything was simply perfect. We were looking for a holiday break from our regular life and hence relaxation, quiet setting, no rush and so on were our key agenda points. What we got there was way beyond our expectation. The most pleasant surprise was the kind of good food which was served to us relentlessly during our four days stay by Chef Vinod and his team.

And some of their family values and attention to detail definitely came through for us as well as all guests who are lucky enough to have stayed there. A steady emphasis is kept on guests' privacy, minimal disturbance, and cultivating an ambience that encourages everyone to look out of the windows to the magnificent views of the Himalayas rather than look at our screens.

bageshwar,"The perfect getaway just hours from Delhi! This Tuscan estate situated in the hills facing Almora is like nothing you've ever seen in India! Every room and common area has a breathtaking view of the valley and on clear days, snow caps are visible just past the foot of your bed.   I've been an expat in India for 19 years and frequently travel to the hills to unwind and clear out my lungs after exhausting stretches in Delhi. In all those trips, The Orchard has stood high above the rest for its outstanding service, gorgeous vistas and luxurious food.  Everything from the architecture to furniture to dining is designed for discerning luxury travelers.

As the day transcends from morning to night, the landscape magically transforms... By dawn, clouds descend down into the valley, holding The Orchard mystically afloat each magical morning. By dusk, satellite towns beyond light up like galaxies.. Through the day, the clearer it is the more likely one is to catch a glimpse of the snow capped Himalayas.. Given The Orchard's incredible vantage point, there is a telescope no less in the library room, where many an evening we spent over drinks, Board games and our iPods plugged in, prior to a scrumptuous meal.

From our arrival to departure, we were made feel special. From the tiniest details of providing refreshing drinks every time you'll come from outside to the architecture and the art in the property, everything is truly amazing. The bath products, linens, food are spectacular. We have relished all the romantic dinner setups provided by the staff. Food is amazing, so are the views from the room.

To give you some information about myself, I am not a fan of road travel or being in a car for 7 hours (from Delhi). However, the ride to the orchard was fabulous. Clear, clean roads, with barely any potholes or traffic; lush, green and beautiful landscapes, and fresh air are your companions after you hit the Corbett belt (~4 hours from Delhi). Thereafter the hills begin, and the roads continue to be great and the hillscapes beautiful. The Kumaon region is different from Himachal in that your hill drive is far lesser (very relevant for those who don't enjoy hill driving).

The cook was amazing and cater to any dietary needs you had. Basically all farm to table food which I loved. The whole vibe of the estate was so serene and calm. The staff was so kind and set up each meal in a different location with a beautiful view. We took a couple trips to go hike nearby.

The combination of a world class chef and freshly picked ingredients from their own organic farm is literally too good to be true.
