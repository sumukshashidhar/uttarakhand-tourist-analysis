bageshwar,"Excellent location surrounded by forests and apple orchards, overlooking the Koshi river deep down in the valley; great property and very good vegetarian and non-veg food. Nice cottages but not well maintained. I bit low in altitude so can get warm. So ideal for the months of Sept/Oct or March.",Jaideep R,/Profile/jaideepr2018,"Guildford, United Kingdom",30
bageshwar,lovely hotel with a quiet ambience... Lovely atmosphere.. Good service..good food..   The only feedback I would have is the reception should b upstairs at the beginning and not at the last..  Coz every guest comes and asks for the reception from the guests living there.. It interrupts the privacy that way.   Rooms r very spacious.. Neat and clean.. With all basic stuffs!   Overall a very good stay!  ,chatterjeevis,/Profile/chatterjeevis,"London, gurgaon",50

bageshwar,"Mr Pandey, the manager and the Owners are all very nice people. From the day I inquired, they accommodated my demands and change in plans with courtesy and patience. Mr Pandey even changed my 2-day booking into a 1-day booking at the last moment which was extremely delightful and relieving to me. With our 2+2 family, they had booked the Cottage#2 for us which had swings and slides right at the back which seemed quite a good deal.  However, despite having the biggest green area in Kausani, we did not have a comfortable stay there. Due to the uncut grass, the access to the play area was not suitable for children and was infested with mosquitoes. These mosquitoes or other bugs did not help in keeping the outdoor dining area peaceful. The slides, swings and other playable rides",Ankit G,/Profile/GAnkit,"New Delhi, India",30

bageshwar,"Was in Kaushani for three nights during March end 2016. Reached there on the day before Holi, the hotel was empty. I had booked for Eco Cottage, since they were on maintenance, got free upgradation of room, and allotted a Super Deluxe Room. View from the room was nice.  The best thing in this hotel was service, and they served with smile. Even when the hotel was empty, food was prepared afresh, and really tasty. The location of the hotel is particularly to be mentioned, connected by a road road which seems private, away from the main road, and no outside noise... sleep quality was superb. Only thing to worry (may be for some) is the insects, but it seemed very natural, as we are invading their place. Morning is very beautiful, with chirping of birds all around. Really loved the",satyakib,/Profile/satyakib,"New Delhi, India",40
bageshwar,"*Location is good; on the main road, way up to the resort is scenic and winding.  *3 kinds of rooms: Deluxe/Super Deluxe/Regular. All 3 are good, hot running water available. Deluxe ones are bigger and have wooden flooring. *Staff is polite and helpful.  *Sometimes there were strange insects in the rooms but seems to be natural in a hilly area. Suggest you keep the doors/windows closed after sunset.  *Food options are many, no specialty though. Dont order exotic sounding dishes instead go with the conservative choices. *Housekeeping services like cleaning and supplies are satisfactory.  The owner stays there with his family and always greets you with a smile. Overall, a nice and peaceful place to stay in!",Lalsaheb,/Profile/Lalsaheb,"Lucknow, India",40
bageshwar,"Enjoyed a lot at this hotel, felt so relaxed after checking in to it. good environment , good view, good food, good service and very good staff. Car parking, almost top of the town.

bageshwar,"First of all I would like to thank our friend (Aditi) for suggesting this place. This is one hell of a place on earth, no wonder why this place is called as mini Switzerland, and the view of Himalayas from Blossom is spectacular. We stayed in the wooden rooms, however this place have huts as well as concrete rooms (choose any 1, you would love all). Clean as crystal everywhere, surrounding and the rooms. Food is delicious, room service is excellent. Owner has also provided place for born fire. You can also play badminton & carom everything is provided. But the best thing is the morning view of scenic splendor and its spectacular 300 km-wide panoramic view of Himalayan, clouds beneath. As soon as you see this you will forget to blink for a while. All in all a best place to stay",divyanshu2015,/Profile/divyanshu2015,"Noida, India",50

bageshwar,This month I took my family for another Visit to Kausani and booked this hotel in advance. I was happy that all room booked by me were all cleaned and ready to occupy when I reached there.

bageshwar,Stay :From my experience i would not like to recommend this hotel's eco hut for anyone staying this resort. The eco hut is terrible place to stay as it has lot of spiders and cockroaches. The spiders roam freely on roof and cockroaches roam freely on your bed and below your mattress on bed. There are other insects also roaming like centipede etc under your mattress which may come anytime on bed.   Do go this hotel if you like cockroaches and spiders and other insects on your bed at night sleeping with you....  Hotel owner did try to clean it but still there were lot of spiders roaming on bed...  Food : The food was good. Hospitality was also good,Ashish Tanwar,/Profile/639ashisht,Faridabad,30
bageshwar,Stayed here for couple of days in August with family. Location is decent with great views of Himalayas.We were fortunate to witness some clear weather which is rarity at this time iof the year  Also the service was good. Hotel staff was very accommodating and helpful. Food was also great. Rooms were  just about average but in this price range I suppose they will do.  Only flipside was that that the grass wasnt well maintained  probably due to the rainy season.  Overall I will  recommend this resort if you are on budget .,ankitjain1985,/Profile/ankitjain1985,"New Delhi, India",40
bageshwar,"Before visiting like every other netizen,  I tried to read reviews about the place and this hotel. While everyone rated the location as the best I found some not happy with the hotel. I must admit that this hotel is the best when it comes to hospitality. I stayed here in a group of 20 and found its food to be the best. The hotel staff were on their toes to give you every delight which you would like to have at a hill station. Kausani is a peaceful location where you can rejuvenate yourself and blossom will ensure that you have a delightful stay. Be it morning tea at 5 am or even a late night dinner. A very rare service found in the hills. Their food is excellent. We returned happily after a 4 night stay. A place worth visiting and a hotel worth staying.

bageshwar,I visited this resort in the summer of 2012. I loved the scenic beauty. It is the most peaceful property in Kausani. The staff is very polite and courteous. The rooms are good and I totally loved he experience of living in a hatke resort for a while. It was all very natural and the hotel guided us for different trekking locations which are otherwise not in the reach of the common tourists.!,Tanushree3191,/Profile/Tanushree3191,new delhi,40
bageshwar,"The word ""Resort"" in the name is very misleading. It isn't much of a resort at all. Just a hotel with a decent view.  Accomodation: The rooms are dirty, untidy and very poorly maintained. The carpets are worn out, and unclean. There are no showers, only buckets. The staff are very reluctant to switch on the geyers (which are located outside the rooms) and therefore the promise of hot water is not quite fulfilled. If the electricity fails, they do not switch on the generator - night or day -- unless you walk down to the reception and ask - forcefully. This has to be done EVERY time the electricity goes off.  Facilities: There are none. Apart from a shabby badminton net, a filthy playground and a really battered carrom board. Even the grass isn't cut, which made me really worried",travellordhigh,/Profile/travellordhigh,delhi,10

No service, rooms are untidy not maintained at all. small insects keep on roaming in your room.You will be committed by lot many things but none of them will be provided. No power supply, no diesel in generators, water problem. In short not worth for staying in this hotel at all.These are my recent observation.

It was raining but kasauni is best and this resort is located at a peaceful location. We were dropped by bus and a car charged 70 rs to its location as resort is on top even while checking out they provided us a car to drop us at bus stand.

bageshwar,Blossom resort is located at a peaceful location in Kasauni amist the Himalayan mountain range. We had booked the family cottage but they were not renovated for a long time. Asked the manager to shift us to the newly built super deluxe cottages which he promptly did. The super deluxe cottages are the best in this resort and offer spectacular view and comfort. Basic amenties like hot water needs improvement. Food served is excellent and very reasonable too. Room service is excellent and you can be assured of the best staff for any of your needs.
