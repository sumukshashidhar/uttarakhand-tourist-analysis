bageshwar,"Beautiful property in a super location. Ideal place to stay if you don't want to miss the majestic Himalayan range right from your bed without even having to get up. The food and the service is great, specially since all of the staff is from nearby villages and towns of Uttarakhand, hence simple people unspoilt by urban habits. Rooms are comfortable and many many options are there depending on your budget and the preferred view. Most hotels in this region don't serve alcohol but don't mind if you carry your own and don't get loud and misbehave after drinking. They are pretty strict re rude behaviour and rightly so. They even have a spa which operates during the summer. Food and service was outstanding.",nkm111,/Profile/nkm111,"Bangkok, Thailand",50
bageshwar,"My overall experience at the hotel was amazing.There are just so many stuff to do.The hotel has a carom board, air hockey in the kids play area as well as a bouncy castle to keep the little ones entertained and a table tennis room in the basement as well as a well stocked library.The staff are extremely friendly and the room service was very prompt. Rooms are clean. This is a great place to go with family and friends.In my opinion, the jungle room 212 has the best sunset view!! The hotel manager. Mr. Pandey personally made sure our family had a comfortable stay. The hotel is in Shitla and you had to cross a well preserved and scenic jungle area to reach Mukteshwar, which takes roughly 20 minutes.

Situated at a beautiful location with a serene backdrop - a very well maintained resort with great amenities - even for Kids . The cottages were super and the cottage which I got was one of the best - We really enjoyed every minute of my stay . The staffs were very friendly and the manager- Mr. Ravi - took real care of us and all the guests. The food was homely - not tough on the tummy . all in al it was super.   I really liked the Kids area and the recreational amenities there and al were in good conditions . The lawns and the garden were really well maintained and it gives you a great feel .

One drives through the thick forest area which is duly manned by the forest department with entry & exit of each vehicle recorded at respective checkpoints. If villagers are to be believed and I have no reason not to, leopards can be spotted in the evenings and early mornings in this area. Spectacular views of Kumaon Himalayas is another highlight of this area.

Hotel provides driver room, parking facility, recreational options for kids in the kids section and adults as well like Snooker, Billiards, Table tennis etc.   Since the hotel is new, some of the services were not available like Spa & Laundry.

In the mid night he attended the call and guided us well till we reached the resort. Truly a warm person. As we reached the resort we were mesmerized by the Himalayan view this property. The staff is very cooperative and service is superb. As it is new property we hardly get anything to point out. beside the fact they had only three people in the kitchen they served really well while the resort was completely booked.

bageshwar,We happen to stop by chance at this resort while traveling to the hills from Delhi. This is a new resort which was just launched a couple of weeks back but the service was so smooth and the food was so impeccable that it didn't seem to be a new property. The staff was more than eager to be helpful and served us hot and delicious dinner. We were upgraded to Himalayan hut which was very spacious and had total wooden interiors. The best thing is that all the rooms are Himalayan facing and the management is very guest oriented.
