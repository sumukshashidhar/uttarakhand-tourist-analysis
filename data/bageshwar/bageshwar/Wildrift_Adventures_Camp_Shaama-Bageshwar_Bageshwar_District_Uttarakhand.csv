bageshwar,"The six of us were there in May 2019. One has to leave the comforts of vehicle travel and march into the woods for a good 3.5 kilometers to reach the huts. All the effort is worth it. Travel light so that you can carry your stuff. On route you meet walnut trees, cheerful kids and amazing flora. The huts are comfortable, provided you can live with bugs... Night time attracts them. There is no supplied water or electricity, so you would get solar lights and stored water. They harvest rain water too. The washrooms are ok, as one would expect in hut living. 6/10  The kitchen and eating area is the highest point, one would be amazed to find so much plane area at that height. The view is good, breathtaking if the weather is good. We enjoyed a good amount of rain and hailstorm.",Sunanda B,/Profile/Tina_tube,"New Delhi, India",50
bageshwar,2 things to remember first: a) Its a far place with limited options to reach there. Preferably call the camp guys they can arrange/help in getting proper transport arrangement. Or drive yourself. I found the roads moderately good enough.  b) There is a hike to reach the camp. Assume 45 mins moderate hike if you are not in top shape. Otherwise this can stretch upto 1hr. But the views are amazing.  This camp is a quite one. Perfect if you just want quite for a few days. The guys running the camp are great. They talk to you if you want. Leave you in peace if you want. Rooms are spacious but limited. Toilets are a minute walk away. So will be an issue if you need to go in the middle of night during winters. But it has running water. Food is just great. Can't explain any more. Dont,mfdilawar,/Profile/mfdilawar,"New Delhi, India",50
bageshwar,"To reach there be patience as you have to walk to reach as it's on mountain's peak. Greenery all around, snow mountains and valley view, sunrise/sunset with different birds chirping sounds gives you fantastic feeling and last but not the least you can spend long hours just watching nature with different creatures. Also Wildrift Team involved nearby villagers who gives you warm welcome which you will not get in 5* hotels. Fresh and pure food they serve is completely different. All meals served by Wildrift cook's team is too tasty that you will start licking your fingers. For all city people it's must vist only work i can suggest .",Neeraj B,/Profile/NeerajB311,,50
bageshwar,Its an awesome feeling being on the top of the world. Very peaceful. You have an option of a Hut or a tent.... we tried both. The view from the stone hut was that of snow clad peaks.... while the tent zipper opened to the first ray of sun falling on the river in the valley down below with changing hues every minute.  Great local food... some of the flavours I had tasted for the first time in my life.  Must add its not for everyone.... there are only a chosen few who get to experience such wonders.,Harmeet B,/Profile/505harmeetb,,50
