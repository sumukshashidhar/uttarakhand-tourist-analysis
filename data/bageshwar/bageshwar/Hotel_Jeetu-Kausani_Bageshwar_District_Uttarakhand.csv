bageshwar,This is hands down the best place to stay in Kausani. It is at the top end of a winding road that leads to a lovely forest. The rooms offer uninterrupted views of amazing Himalayan range from Badrinath area peaks to Nepal. The rooms are amazing with attached balconys that have the view of snow covered Himalayas. You can just go there and spend all day in your balcony and watch the mountains. The owner is an amazingly friendly gentleman who stays at the property and is super helpful with everything. The place can host large travel groups or families. DONT MISS THIS!,Nikhil J,/Profile/478nikhilj,,50
