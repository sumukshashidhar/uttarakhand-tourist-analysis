bageshwar,"Suddenly planned a short trip to Bageshwar on 26th Jan 2019 , after finishing work started search for Hotel , reached this hotel and checked rooms and rates , person on the reception looked new and like deaf and dumb , finally got a room facing Saryu river front ,Good scenic view , ordered hot snacks , served cold , dirty linen , no water , shared geyser , somehow dinner served was okay. Overall a very poor experience.",SUNIL WAKHLOO,/Profile/09042014,"Noida, India",10
bageshwar,"After spending 15 days in mountains we headed back via Bageshwar. We'd heard of a hotel overlooking the Surrya river. Narendra palace was a delight, large clean room with verandah overlooking the river, great views. Hotel manager Mayank Khetwal gave us a brief history of the friendly town and it's connection to the God Shiva. They can organize a trek to Pindari glacier from here also. Food and service was good. We'll be back.",dlcs50,/Profile/dlcs50,"Rishikesh, India",50
bageshwar,I stayed for one night with my family when we were going to Munsyari. Hotel Narendra palace is the best you can get in Bageshwar. All the major points of interest are nearby. Situated at the banks of river Saryu. Rooms were big enough to accommodate a family of 4 with grown up children. Two double beds with well furnished bathrooms. Food was great though choice was limited.,Anurag73,/Profile/Anurag73,"Bareilly, India",40
bageshwar,We opted for the best room of the Hotel and stay was really very comfortable. In the peak summer season Bageshwar can be hot and AC may be required. View of Saryu river from our balcony was scenic. The Staff tried its best to help in any manner possible. I found the rates to be very reasonable. Food served was fresh and delicious.,Adv.SiddharthVerma,/Profile/AdvSiddharthVerma,"New Delhi, India",40
bageshwar,"Worst hotel I have ever seen in uttrakhand.  Room service was worst.. Tv was not working. Staff was very lazy and rude, taking hours to serve a cup of tea. Over hyped and over priced hotel in Bageshwar.",Gaurav P,/Profile/GauravP1067,,10
bageshwar,"Both facilities available here Stay and food , and i realized it one of the good place for peace just beside the saryu river Offer Veg and Non veg foods  Budget and Luxuries accommodation   The Hotel location at bageshwar kapkote road",DanuAdventure,/Profile/DanuAdventure,"Bageshwar, India",50
bageshwar,"The hotel is clean and comfortable, rooms range based on economical, better and better with ac. There was construction going on so we couldn't use the balconies and there was a lot of dust. Manager was helpful and courteous, other staff members were indifferent. I suddenly fell ill and had to abandon the trek for which we arrived at Bageswhar, stayed here to recuperate for a day. There aren't many choices in this small town, this seems to top the list.

bageshwar,We have visited this place in October 2016.It is on the bank of Saraju River. A beautiful place to stay. Rooms are big and well ventilated .The Restaurant is particularly very good with variety of food to eat. River Saraju is very pleasant surprise from the window. Recommend for families for a short stay.  .,Dr Prabhat Ranjan Ghosh,/Profile/drprghosh50,India,50
bageshwar,"The Hotel is situated on the River Bank, back of the hotel is just on the River. Not a luxury hotel but ok place to stay with nice friendly staff. You dont have much choice for staying in Bageshwar so ok.",Sandeep S,/Profile/DeanAAIRIITR,Roorkee,50
bageshwar,"This hotel is situated on the banks of River Saryu, though river is further deep behind Hotel, nevertheless, the sound and aroma of it scares and amuses you at the same time. Evenings are little more imaginative when you can hear the roar of river clearly. It has a beautiful balcony restaurant overlooking river, where you can enjoy breakfast basking in morning sun.",Muchhadd,/Profile/Muchhadd,"Mumbai, India",40
