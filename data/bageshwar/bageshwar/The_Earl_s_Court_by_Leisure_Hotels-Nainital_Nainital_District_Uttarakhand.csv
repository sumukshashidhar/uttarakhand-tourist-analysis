bageshwar,I happened to choose this hotel on the basis of reviews that I checked before going for Earl's court and so I wanted to share mine and my family's experience at this place. Thank you for making the stay memorable  Earl's court. Staffs were welcoming although on the very first day I felt a lil weird with the way one of the reception staff's behavior. Food tasted really well and were served hot. Hygiene of the place were maintained and housekeeping service was very well. Looking forward to come again during winters when it snows.   Just a suggestion to make some service available for drivers as well so that they are not suffered in cold for not getting atleast a dormitory facility. Food they will be able to manage but then stay in such cold climate in a car is very inhuman. ,soumyasanj,/Profile/soumyasanj,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",40

bageshwar,"We stayed in Nainital for 4 nights: 2,3, 4 and 7 Nov 2013. After some research on internet from TripAdvisor etc, we booked this one hoping it to probably be the perfect hotel. Fortunately it really turned out to be the perfect one. Big, clean and very well furnished and maintained rooms. I wont say the hotel property is as grand as a 5-star but when you step into your room, you would hardly see any difference from an equivalent level room in a 5-star (i.e. compare Deluxe to Deluxe) in terms of room/bathroom size, quality of furnishings, cleanliness, courtesy and promptness of staff etc.  All said, its a bit off the mall road: 200m further from Manu Maharani, so in order to come to back to the hotel after dinner in mall road, you will really need a car not because of the distance",jatingrover,/Profile/jatingrover,"Singapore, Singapore",50
bageshwar,"We were a group of friends visiting Nainital in July 2013. The hotel itself is quite old with a distinct charm of the old days of the Raj. However, the older parts of the hotel were under renovation around the time we went. We were put up in the new wing of the hotel which is distinctly average and lacks the class of the older rooms, which we saw as well. The food was very average. We tried the buffet dinner and it was similar to your average restaurant meal. The hotel staff also seemed to be preoccupied with keeping the police officers/bureaucrats who had been visiting the place for a drinks party. In sum, if i am going back to Nainital, I would be looking for better places unless they have fixed the old wings.",Sudhanshu R,/Profile/500sudhanshur,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",30

The staff then arranged for warm water. location was beautiful as it was snowing around. access could be tricky in snow for inexperienced drivers  due to skidding as the hotel is on hilltop. beddings were comfortable but extra quilt would be welcome in cold weather. be careful when walking around in snow , you can slip.  hope that the management could sort out voltage problems and warm water supply issues for more comfort in cold weather",Vikas Sharma,/Profile/VikasS718,,40

I visited this hotel 2 months ago.Let me tell you that you will not be able to find a better hotel than this in Nainital.I even stayed in Manu Maharani for 2 nights which was my biggest mistake as the rooms were stinky because of the carpet. The rooms here are neat and clean as the hotel is newly renovated. The food is very good(especially the chefs who are very cooperative and have a friendly nature.)
