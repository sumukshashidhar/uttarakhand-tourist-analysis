A few commute tips: Driving to this location is a bit tricky mainly the last 1KM If you are driving on your own and not very comfortable in steep climb then I would advise using their shuttle to go to mall road.

Staff at the hotel makes every effort possible to make your stay comfortable.  We stayed in one of the suite rooms which are quite spacious with 2 rooms with 2 TVs, so if you have kids, consider taking this room.

We requested the Hotel to provide us with the Transport service as we had kids with us  for less than 2-3 Kms but they refused. The same thing happened while departure also. The hotel was reluctant to provide us with the transport service when they clearly knew we were with small kids. They had 2 shuttles which were free at that time.

Escaping the city life, the plan for day at the hill station is simple – eat, drink, dance and repeat doing all of that while admiring the gorgeous surroundings. And that is exactly what I did with my family when we stayed at the Shervani Hilltop in Nainital recently. Nestled amidst the hills, Shervani Hilltop is a 4 star boutique hotel. Tucked away from the bustling crowds of Nainital and within a few kilometers from the mall road lies the beautiful Shervani Hilltop Hotel.

It has a steep climb up so bear that in mind while driving up.  You may also want to request a room adjacent to the small lawns in case you are travelling as a group.

The hotel is fair distance from the lake where you can find peace anf nature and yet not soo far that you can't reach the lake without a car.   Service was good and staff was friendly in the off season.  Food was also amongst the better ones in nainital.

On seeing me so unwell, the front desk expedited my check in, had a glass of nimbo pani brought at the reception, and not only that, had me taken by their vehicle to the doctor, where the driver accompanied me to the clinic, got my medicines from the chemist and did all the registering and making of papers at the clinic. The chef specially prepared a light moong dal khichdi for me, and called to check how I was feeling.

bageshwar,"We stayed in Sherwani in Oct'15 and liked every bit of it. I don't think there is any negative that I can write here, however the positives are as below:  1) Food:  Amazing, we had breakfast as well as dinner and found it to be good. 2) Location: It is not too far from the Mall road and hence commuting doesn't take too much time. Also they provide free shuttle service to and fro from the mall road which is a great help especially considering the steep height at which the hotel is situated. 3) Rooms: are well done and offers a good view. We stayed in the garden facing room on the first floor. 4) Staff: Very courteous and helpful and go the extra mile to help and serve their customers. 5) Others: They organise magic shows, DJ in the night to engage with their guest.

There are some awesome trees though, suitably labelled, and both the weeping willows and the deodhar are magnificent. The garden is a good place to take in some sun as you sip a cuppa tea or enjoy breakfast. And yes they do have a good breakfast spread. The rooms are good, large, but offer no view. Considering one climbs a steep slope to reach the top of the hill, the lack of view is disconcerting. Otherwise, a good place to stay, retaining its old world manners and charm.

This 2km uphill stretch is steep, esp the last 100 meters which has a very high gradient (~approx 60 degrees) and is narrow too, so you need some good driving skills to reach the hotel.

In fact you feel isolated from rest of Nainital, and even you cant walk to eat elsewhere. So If you just want to relax in greenry, away from the crowd of Mall road or Naini Lake, this property may be very good. Further, property /rooms are cottage type, so if you are travelling in a group, quite possibly you are staying far. ..   For me this property is ok for a dry day, however a big no in rains, as if you even go for breakfast/dinner from room, you may have to face rains, on slippery slopes or stairs.

Since the room was extremely small in size we requested for the room change. The other room was larger with absolutely zero view.  Hotel provides free pick up and drop to/from the mall road which is quite necessary as it is extremely difficult to manage with your own vehicle.   Food is excellent. In house Tambola and live music keeps the evenings alive.  Staff is helpful and courteous. Gaming area for the kids is an added fun. Overall it was a decent experience.

Negatives: 1) Our check in experience was unpleasant and we were initially moved into a small room with no view.

To me the best parts of the hotel are (1) modern rooms and bathrooms which make sure you do not miss creature comforts (2) great outdoors for you to take in the hill breeze (3) very homely staff and kitchen who are always ready to help and even customize menus for the small ones (4) quiet location away from the bustle of the Mall Road, yet still accessible with hotel cars within 10 minutes.

M r Bhupinder of reservations resort manager Mr Bisht were warm and helpful, too. The live music in the evening was surprisingly good.  However, water has a taste. Probably the RO filter is due for a change, if they have one. Some of the new premium rooms are really small. Pl see the room and then accept.

The dining hall and hotel was much smaller than we expected. The day was sunny and so we sat outside on the lawn and order for very light lunch of sandwich and french fries etc. The waiters were very helpful with our selection. the food took some time coming but when it did it was quite tasty and filling. The prices were reasonable.    The only tip I would like to give to potential guests is that the hotel is situated at a very high point and the climb can be very steep. If you have your own vehicle make sure you have a good driver to take you there. The hotel does provide a shuttle service but I am not sure it does for diners.,tjjohn,/Profile/tjjohn,"Meerut, India",40

Thus we selected Shervani Hilltop that offers a relaxing and rejuvenating trip for families/groups looking for a refreshing getaway from city's hustle-bustle.  Here is my view of this property  Location: The Hotel is on top of a hill starting from the upper edge of the lake called malli-tal.

Minus: 1) Had issues with hot water and heater. We had to wait for hot water for long after opening the tap. We did not get the enough hot (temperature) water for bath.
