Once there, I liked the location as it was quite a good drive from main road and quite closer to hill top giving good view of bhimtal town, also its easier to book a cab and take a day trip to nainital to visit main places there as its too much crowded there.

Upside of the hotel is tasty food they serve in elegantly decorated dining hall. Food prices are also reasonable and worth it. Staff is so helpful and supporting. They arranged contacts for doing paragliding in Bhimtal.  Only issue is hotel approach way is under construction and need good driver to reach hotel on single sloppy path.,296lavk,/Profile/296lavk,,50

My special thanks to Mr. Vidyasagar Pandey - Manager a very humble and cooperative person. He made our stay very remarkable with full support.

And we reached out to this resort at short notice. Being a relatively new resort, the kind of professionalism and expertise shown by management was awesome. We got a good bargain due to size of the group, even though it was long weekend. The resort was at a location where bus could not go, they made sure to send enough vehicles to take us all. We had 4 meals during our stay- 2 breakfast and 2 dinners. Each one of them was delicious. The staff readily agreed to our request for anything we want to eat.

bageshwar,One of the finest Hotel in Bhimtal with Excellent Hospitality and each staff is so well trained and meet you with so much of warmth every time you meet them.  The property is well maintained and the food was excellent.  For Nature lovers and staying in crowded metropolitan cities it is an ideal place to stay and relax and rejuvenate yourself.  This property is in June estate in Bhimtal and approach road towards the Hotel is in a very bad condition and around 2.5 KM on heights from Bhimtal lake.  The Hotel should speak to authorities and construct the roads ASAP.The Hotel should start free shuttle services to his guest till Bhimtal Lake.,Pradeep N,/Profile/PradeepN313,,50

They even provided us with a driver to take our car down to the main road. Staff was very good and kept asking us for feedback.  +'s (great things): Food, Service and Staff Behavior, Rooms, Cleanliness, View, Activities (carom, TT, Pool table, badminton)  ^'s (areas of improvement): approach road is a very rough 2 km stretch, they are ensuring it gets repaired by next season, it is slightly costly for a Bhimtal deal, corridor music was loud and was on till around 11pm.

bageshwar,I went on a trip to bhimtal with cousins for 2 days and stayed at The Ferm Hilsside Resort. Our first impression was very good as the hotel has an amazing location and view of the valley from room balcony was awesome.  Let me list down 2 problems that we faced:  1. Approach road of aound 2.5 kms is in very bad condition. Our Toyota Fortuner's tyre bursted on the stretch due to the rough road condition. And you can very well analyse that if a fortuner's tyre can burst on that road then its almost impossible for a hatchback or cedan to reach there. On the very next day in morning we saw that another tyre also got punctured in parking which was in perfect condition a night before.  2. At the time of checkout we were told that we have done something to a table in room and we will,Ankitgupta24,/Profile/ankitgupta24,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",20
bageshwar,"First let me start with the star rating, it shows that it is a 3 star property but it is much higher in actual (It deserves to be at least a 4 Star). Newly constructed building with lots of open space as garden and dining area. Spacious rooms with all the standard 4Star amenities (I stayed in Wintergreen). Almost all the rooms are Valley facing. Cleanness is what you can see in each of the corner of this property. Staffs are professionally behaved and well trained to take care of guests. Food is nice, particularly the breakfast.  One thing is that you have to drive a bit steep on rough road to reach the property but once you reach the Hotel, you will find its really worth.The Fern Hillside is a destination in itself.",Ashish S,/Profile/ashisri,"Noida, India",50

The rooms are very nicely done with modern fittings and interiors. Food is excellent as is the hospitality.

I was committed a 2 fern club  rooms but was given 1 as  a so called ‚Äúupgraded room‚Äù which was smaller in size than the club room (basic)?  Hospitality wise this hotel is lesser rather no where than what my chosen one was  - this was a complete waste of time and energy.   Food was expensive but not worth.

bageshwar,I normally don't review places but I am so disappointed with the place and management that I feel people should know what they are getting into before booking this resort. I booked this place through booking.com ( hidden taxes were charged once i reached the property) .  The road that leads up to the hotel is very narrow and steep and in a poor condition and is super dangerous for monsoons.  The management knew in advance that i was travelling with my parents for my birthday and yet there was no arrangement made at the hotel.  Air con in the middle of the night conked off and the staff came to my room with an old rusted table fan :/  I understand that the property is new and has teething troubles but then they shouldn't be  selling rooms at the prices that they do.
