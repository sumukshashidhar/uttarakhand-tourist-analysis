bageshwar,"Location of the hotel is excellent with a balcony outside every room. All the rooms have good view and u can experience sun rise from the room itself. Owner, Mr. Joshi and support staff are quite helpful to advice on things to do in Kausani. Meals were also tasty with reasonably large quantities.  Rooms were also quite clean and of reasonable sizs.",Manish S,/Profile/ManishS2143,,50
bageshwar,"I have recently (last week of Dec2016) stayed in this hotel with my family. The property is closely located to Gandhi Ashram. As we have visited during off season time, manager upgraded our room from deluxe to super deluxe. Rooms are neat and clean and with geyser in the toilet. From room balcony you can view the entire range on a clear day. Food quality is very good. Staffs are also very helpful. They can arrange campfire also. You need to pay extra for that.",avra a,/Profile/avraadhya,Kolkata,50
bageshwar,"It is one of good hotel in Kausani for staying. Very near to Anashakti Ashram where Gandhiji stayed for some time. Since, this Ashram is one of the main attraction of this town, location of this hotel is good for reaching at this ashram in the evening hours when mountain ranges can be seen and Prarthana and interaction with different people of different states is held. Sunrise can be viewed from the hotel terrace itself. Near to hotel is nature park where one can stroll in morning hours. Good for average middle class family.",pns472,/Profile/pns472,"Jaipur, India",40
bageshwar,"The view from the hotel was awesome. with every room, they have the balcony which directly give you the view of the himalayas. You can see very nice sun rice.  But the hotel facilities are poor. NO WIFI. Poor TV signal, very low light in hotel.",Rohit G,/Profile/RohitG1592,,30
bageshwar,The location is very nice and has complete Himalayan view. The rooms were below average although the staff was supportive. The phones were not working and the pillow covers were torn. It seems the hotel was well planned but not maintained at all.  You can view sunrise from your room and has private cosy balcony. Need to find a waiter for almost 20 min to order morning tea as phones were not working.,richagoel15,/Profile/richagoel15,"New Delhi, India",30
bageshwar,"We visited to Kausani between 9th/May to 11th/May and stayed at Jeetu Inn, its location is superb and experience we had from  the Hotel (Reception mgmt. as well room services) was at level of decent hospitality and Friendly. Accommodation type here is 2-star and rooms are maintained at fair hygiene with its kind of property. Avoid the rooms with carpet (that's the only observation). Staff from reception and room services are very collaborative and supporting in nature.",a9158882415,/Profile/a9158882415,"Pune, India",50
bageshwar,"Stay was average, staff was good but unhelpful as they have excuses for everything, menu prices was too high but the quality was poor, do visit to dhabas near to gandhi ashraam for good quality of food.",Sanjay M,/Profile/944sanjaym,,50
bageshwar,A good value for money place. A great location on the hill slope gives you a very good panoramic view of the himalayas and of the sunrise. The rooms are nice and clean but donot expect too much as this is a budget place. Serves good local food also,Jim,/Profile/jimvarghese,"Kozhikode, India",40
bageshwar,"I visited this hotel in dec.2015 in delux suite and it was so good, acomodation is very good,view is priceless and the staff is so friendly, they provided everything you wanted so kind,and rooms were giving the feeling of 1800s,thats why it was so fun",Smile00777,/Profile/Smile00777,,40
bageshwar,"Excellent view from the hotel. service is good, food was good, Room was maintained but old furniture. Major attraction is mind blowing view of Himalayas from hotel itself, Beware of monkeys. Recepcenist helped me & alotted room even my booking was for next day which was my mistake. Thanks for the same.",rajanshah88,/Profile/rajanshah88,"Mumbai, India",30
bageshwar,We had been to Jeetu Inn during Diwali Time. Nice hotel with fantastic Sun Rise View. One can see Sun Rise from Balcony of their room. Food was also good and staff was very co operative.

bageshwar,"“Fantastic Hotel, Ambience, Service, Food, etc.” I am writing this review with great pleasure and memories which I have filled in my life. Earlier I was afraid of my visit due to several negative reviews about fort but all vanished out with their nice hospitality.It all starts with smooth Checkin and checkout . I have to say that each staff member was very humble. There are so many things to do and 2 days you will require for that.I suggest everyone atleast  to visit once in life and to observe their hospitality themselves by avoiding negative reviews. I will surely comeback.",jainpankaj123,/Profile/jainpankaj123,"Alwar, India",50

bageshwar,"Visited with friends in May, 2015. Decent hotel with best view of Himalayas in Kausani. Food is expensive. If you walk a little down the hill (next to Hotel Krishna), you will find some really good (and economical food) at Zila Panchayat Tourist Hotel (Government run).

bageshwar,this hotel run on fake facilities and real conditon of rooms are worse than it seems in pics. there are lots of insects  in the rooms and was having suffocating odour.servtce was also not good. but if u want to spend more money on hotel on your trip then there are many other options to take...........................so think before booking,Aakansha S,/Profile/aakanshas2014,"Ghaziabad, India",30
bageshwar,Worst services .... decent location and rooms ..but badly managed... completely unguided staff... worst food I have ever had...... no availability of items mentioned in menu.... whatever you ask first they say ok sir we will prepare it and after half an hour they will call you to tell .. sorry its not available.... They surprising part was that they told us to go to any restaurant to have dinner .... instead of getting it available at hotel ..... where anybody will go late in night to have dinner even after booking a hotel after paying handsome amount.... not at all worth .... will never stay in this property again ...,Amitjoshiadi,/Profile/Amitjoshiadi,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",10
bageshwar,"I stayed there during my trip to Lucknow-Nainital-Kausani with a travel agent from Calcutta as a part of my Botany excursion from College, loved every bit of their hospitality, the staff were extremely cordial and friendly, the view is stupendous from this Hotel, watching the sunrise and sunset is like a dream! The winding path outside the Hotel leads to Anashakti Ashram, a must see for the tourists, we collected many samples while walking down the path for our survey, there is beautiful plantation by the sides of this winding path. Kausani is truly a magnificent location which is not so well known. This Hotel is good enough to travel for couples, they have special honeymoon rooms, the view is best from these rooms. This will easily fall in your budget as well.",Ananya B,/Profile/Ananya1984,"Bengaluru, India",50
bageshwar,"Jeetu Inn is a property recently acquired by Hotel Pratiksha. The location is at the highest point of Kausani. Rooms are big, Price is reasonable and the view is the most mind blowing you can find in Kausani. You can see the famous Kausani sunrise right from your bed...and there is also a sitout in the balcony from where you can enjoy the sunrise... Staff is really helpful and they will not say no to anything you request. Special mention: Managers: Mr.Gajendra Mehra and Mr.Pratap Mehra Room Service: Mr.Kuldeep. These 3 guys made our stay really comfortable and smooth. Thanks a lot. Like all other places, this place does have some cons but they are minor compared to the overall package. There is a big problem of insects in the whole of kausani because its totally surrounded by",ankit893,/Profile/ankit893,"Mumbai, India",40
