bageshwar,"As its name suggests , Its a homestay with warm hospitality at your disposal . Its been taken care by a sweet lady and her 25 year old son . This place offers the best view that Kausani can offer . See my photos for yourself.  Lunch and dinner options are limited and the lady owner makes all the food for the guests herself . Rooms are basic but clean . Himalayan view with Nanda devi peak right in front of your windows is mind boggling..",Tejas Joshi,/Profile/tejasj03,"Pune, India",40
bageshwar,Nice and clean rooms with big size of bed (easily accommodate 3 people). Best part of this guest house is View of Himalaya its marvelous. They have only one bellboy for service so cant expect like hotel but its manageable.,Dipen Poriya,/Profile/Dipen_Poriya,"Rajkot, India",40
bageshwar,"I was unsure about my stay over here after reading the reviews. But my stay changed my perception.  Room location is too good, food prepared by the family is pure homely. Rooms are clean. But don't expect a hotel like service. Things may take a bit of time but please have patience. The property is run by a widow and her son. So, be kind to them.  Sorry, couldn't take pictures.  I assure you that you won't repent if you book your stay here.",manchuray,/Profile/manchuray,"Bengaluru, India",50
bageshwar,The view of the snow and peak from this property is very good. You can wake up in morning and can enjoy the good scenaric view. Apart from this hotel staff was very less and room was not very well maintained. Room service was also very slow.,garhwaliya,/Profile/garhwaliya,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
bageshwar,It's a very bad option. They have no staff. The location is horrible. Place is badly maintained. It's not worth staying in. Will spoil your trip. The rooms are small and stuff and not clean at all. The entrance to the place is behind some other buildings. Very dark and dingy. Overall completely avoidable. ,Shubhangi P,/Profile/932shubhangip,,10
