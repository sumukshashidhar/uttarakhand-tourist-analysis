bageshwar,"This is a good resort. However for winters, it needs some more facilities. Here is the breakdown : Pros:  1. Great View,  2. located on a quiet road, so you can enjoy walks 3. Staff is quite helpful  Cons:  This is specifically for winters: it gets too cold at night. Lack of blowers in the room is quite a pain. The halogen heaters just don't work. Additionally, the geyser switch is outside the room. So, to turn it on, you havr to leave the room, go to the back and then switch it on, which is just bizarre!  I would really recommend this place for Spring - Autumn but it needs to do a lot more to be good for winters. ",apoorv vij,/Profile/apoorvv964,,30

bageshwar,"We visited Kausani in the 1st week of October and it was made all the more memorable by our stay at Mountain Villa. Our room was in the 1st floor and with the skies being clear, we could enjoy awesome views of the Himalayas - complete with Trishul, Nandadevi and Panchachuli range in all their grandeur from the balcony itself. The hotel itself is very beautiful and the garden at the front complements it. The rooms were pretty spacious with glass windows opening to the balcony.   Well, now here comes what's best here - Hospitality. The staff were very courteous and helpful always.

bageshwar,"We decided enough of Himachal this year - let us explore the other areas where the mountains are clearly the main attraction. With the soaring heat, Himachal has become completely inaccessible and boring for the ""in plains"" dwellers.  Finally, after a lot of research and phone calls - we narrowed down to small town Kausani, in Uttaranchal, above Ranikhet.   The drive thru the Ghaziabad is horrendous, but don't make the mistake of following Goggle maps, which takes you thru fields and unpaved road as alternative in the Ghaziabad area. We fell for that trap and the car got a loose tire as a result.  Any how, we halted at Jim Corbett and the hotel there was not that great, ready my earlier feedback about that place.

We were there from 24-26 December 2018 as a family of five and were blessed with 3 outstandingly crystal clear days which gave us a view of the Himalayas which took our breath away.  Mr. Harish is the heart and soul of the hotel and he personally looks after the needs of all the guests. The food is excellent and the rest of the staff is really friendly and helpful. One must keep in mind that this is a fairly remote location and getting supplies is challenging.

With a clear view of the valley below and snow capped mountains above you fell like being in heaven already. the staff is very amiable and the amenities at the property are very decent.   The only downside is the food being served. The taste and the portions are both not upto the mark. Myself being a foodie, this matters a lot to me. There were not too many options either. They would keep insisting on having the local flavours inspite of the long menu they have printed. And its best to go by their recommendations, as if you try to experiment they are not able to do a good job of it  But again the rates are so economical that you might ignore all of this once you see the bill.

Rooms were absolutely spacious with all types of basic necessities..... Lovely garden is maintained inorder to enhance the beauty of the resorts....... Lovely place for the honeymooners..... One can see the whole range of himalayas from the hotel, rather from the rooms",Bongatheartprajna,/Profile/prajnapguharakshit,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",50
bageshwar,"We went for a weekend gateway in August2011. Kausani is very beautiful during rains. The location of the hotel is amazing, with excellent service & food.The location is lovely during springs as is lush green everywhere. Thogh there are no tourist location around except a Tea garden. But an ideal place for couples & family to spend time together. We stayed there for 2 nights, spent the evening having fun in the balcony. Mornings were spent playing badminton & trekking. I really enjoyed & would lov to go again.",Gurpreet_Nikhil,/Profile/Gurpreet_Nikhil,"New Delhi, India",50
bageshwar,Though it is a average hotel but its location makes it very attractive.From the hotel room one can view very long Himalayan range. We were lucky the during our stay we could see snow covered nanda devi and trishul parvat very clearly. The view is so beautiful that one can sit and go on watching for several hours. Hotel is very old.Room which was provided to me was very good .Bathroom was very big and clean. The small hut type restaurant should be renovated and enclosed to get rid of mosquitoes.Staff was very good and helpful.Food was nice. The reception should be improved. It is not at all impressive.There is no computer and it is in open.,vivek p,/Profile/VivekP170,"Jamnagar,Gujarat,India",40
bageshwar,kausani was the place where we enjoyed the most in this trip of kumaon.  chevron mountain villa made our stay confortable there.   Gandhiji was not at all wrong in saying that this is the switzerland of india. it really is.  the location of this mountain villa is also so beautiful and quiet. you will love to enjoy the nature here.   take the feel of a typical indian hill station village. walk as much as you can to enjoy the nature.   rooms are confortable. food was good. instead of spa and other activities its better to devote time more in lap of nature.   you can ejoy bonfire and barbeque at night. its a wonderful think in pink winter.,Dr MADHUL S,/Profile/madhulsinghal,jaipur,40
bageshwar,"May not be the best hotel in Kasauni but it has best view to himalayan ranges. Staff is very cooperative, food is good. Even you can view Himalayas from inside the room. Located in very peaceful area , you can enjoy your walks any time of the day. But June is not good time visit as view to Himalayas is not clear , recommended time is August or December to January. Plan in it around full moon so you can view Himalayas in nights also.",CASSIODelhi,/Profile/CASSIODelhi,DELHI,50
bageshwar,"Mountain Villa is a cozy property in picture perfect Kausani.  With so many stay options in the little town overlooking the Himalays, it is difficult to make a choice.  But Chevron manages to maintain its charm: repeat visitors like us can vouch for the fact. EACH room is mountain-facing, with a nice sit-out space. The staff is friendly & hard-working, the rooms are spacious, & the food is good: PERFECT for a lazy holiday in the hills :)",nrupal,/Profile/nrupal,Mumbai,50
bageshwar,"We stayed at the Chevron Mountain Villa , Kausani for 2 nights and 3 days. It is a charming little Villa facing the Himalayas. It could have been a great place for a honeymoon ,if  we could omit a few important details .  For starters , the room was pretty badly maintained. It is not as big as it looks in the photographs on their website , neither that nicely done-up . Ditto for the bathroom. For the kind of money one pays to stays there, it is very mediocre. Ideally a room maintained like that should not cost more than a Rs. 750 (great views included) during peak season. The floor does not have any carpets, so even if one walks lightly on the first floor, the people staying below can hear everything . Not only that , the bell boy will come and tell you in the middle of the",ritiroybetai,/Profile/ritiroybetai,Pune,20
bageshwar,"Chevron Mountain Villa is a nice, homely large house turned into a hotel. Extremely peaceful and quiet (even more than Kausani itself, which is not busy unlike more popular hill-stations).... since it is about 10 min uphill from the town centre, where most of the other hotels are. We stayed in Jan (off-season) there for 2 nights and really liked the place. Our room was on the top floor, and the view from the window as well as the lawns was magnificent. The best view of Nanda Devi and Trishul.  Best things here: 1. Lovely breakfast at the lawn... watching the snow covered Himalayas 2. Bonfire every evening.... you get a breathtaking view of the stars. It is quite cold outside, at least in Jan. No snow here this year.  Breakfast and dinner both days was very good.... both Indian ",cruiser_ind,/Profile/cruiser_ind,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
