bageshwar,"I booked Hotel Shivay while visiting Kausani last October. Initially, after reading reviews from TripAdvisor, I was a little confused as there were both positive and negative feedbacks; still, as the hotel fit in my budget and the location was good, I wanted to give it a try. The best part of this hotel is its excellent location. The photograph you are seeing is from the lower road and you have ample parking spaces in front of the hotel. This road, towards the right side of the photograph, is going up and taking a bend, and you can access a higher stretch of the same road from the 3rd floor (as common with hill houses). The upper entrance at 3rd floor is located right in the middle of the marketplace, just where buses stop and shared jeeps line up. True, you cannot get a glance",Kumaraditya S,/Profile/KumaradityaS1,"Diamond Harbour, India",50
bageshwar,Very bad rooms which stinked and had pests. The hotel is an old one and on the road with good traffic an dhence quite noisy too. Add to it the pathetic condition of the rooms and it kinda spoils the whole travel experience. Better avoid it.,dhinchak14,/Profile/dhinchak14,Milan,10
bageshwar,"As a part of our family tour in uttarakhand we enjoyed one day stay in hotel shivay in kausani, Hotel shivay is in front of bus stand and this is the 1st hotel once you reach kausani, so it is very easy to locate, it was booked on line through hotelshivay.in. we book a non ac room, rate 1000 Rs/ day, We reach the place at 11am, as soon as we reach the place we got a very warm welcome, our luggage immediately shifted to the room allocated for us, it is quite spacious and clean having a sofa, tea table, cupboard, TV, telephone, bathroom was nicely cleaned and also too large, 24 hrs geyser hot water supply, only negative point was the bath soap was not of good quality, hotel check in and check out time is 10am.

bageshwar,The room was small and the floor was dirty. There was sand all over the carpeted floor. Bed linen was dusty and bathroom was dimly lit with cracked walls.  Only positive would be the food which took some time to prepare as they cooked to order. It was quite nice.  Ther was no wifi either. Not recommended unless you have very small budget and don't mind adjusting for a night.,J P,/Profile/jpB6241HF,"Singapore, Singapore",10
bageshwar,Hotel Shivay is the cheapest and best hotel.Its simply A Lodge with a very nice rooms at low price.Parking space is small so its very difficult to park at peak time.only thing is Himalaya view in kausani and gandhi ashram. Again at cloudy weather cloud covers the himalaya and nothing can be seen.,Shubham Agrawal,/Profile/ShubhamTheBreak,"Indore, India",40
bageshwar,Nice and quite place with economical stays and food.  If you are looking for something like Shimla then don't go but if you are looking for a quite place with so many nice people and places to visit. Kausani is the place to go.,Devendra Pratap S,/Profile/DevendraPratapS6,,40

bageshwar,"This hotel is at the entrance of the city, a huge four story building. To enter the hotel from the first entry point you need to have strong knees as there are about 30 steep steps to climb which is a situation for old peoples.  To bypass this, take as round and instead of going from the first entrance; proceed further and from the only square of the city, onto the left hand is the reception of the hotel and from here you don't have to climb but to get down. As its well said that ""Difficult to climb but simple to get down"".  All the rooms are facing the main road and those on the top floor are better to view the divine nature. From the gallery of the hotel one can view the sunset in clear weather.  In the vicinity of the hotel is a temple were the tourist worship and expect",Kaudesh,/Profile/Kaudesh,"Aurangabad, India",40
