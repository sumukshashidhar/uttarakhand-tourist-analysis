bageshwar,We stayed at the deluxe cottage and they were very spacious. Had a separate changing room and the balcony having sitting/sleeping option. No cleaning issues.  The view from the cottage was simply outstanding. On a clear day the entire range can be seen from the balcony or just infront of the cottage.  Tasty foods at very reasonable rate with non veg option available. We took half chili chicken which had a massive portion size. You can also opt room service for snacks.  ,Manik Roy,/Profile/Manik_loves_mountain,"Kolkata, India",50

We experienced the beautiful view of the peaks of Majestic Himalayas and found ourselves fortunate enough to be present at Kausani the day on which peak view was clear and what a beauty it was - sitting idle and capturing the hide and seek between the glorious peaks and the wandering clouds through our seeking eyes !   Now the 180 degree pure reverse experience we witnessed on other day - its snow fall and intensity became heavier along with the progress of day !

bageshwar,If you want to see the best sunrise and best sunset from the same place it has to be Kausani in Uttrakhand and from the Property of KMVN known as Trishul. Ideal time to visit is between October to March when you normally dont get the noises of tourist all around you and the Himalayan range  gives out it best show.  The property is very well located with unobstructed views from the room specially from cottage no 8. It is not lavish but very airy and clean. The service is prompt without being obtrusive. The food is wholesome and tasty as long as you stick to North Indian cuisine. Your own private campfire with smell of fresh pine everywhere on a chilly night is an experience you will never forget.
