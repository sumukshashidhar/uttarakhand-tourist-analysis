The resort is nicely and artistically done, quiet place, plenty of area to walk around. Approach to the resort is cramped up through narrow lanes. Complementary drop and pick to/from the Mall Road.

Food Rate is so high that one have to pay hefty amount for any meal if it is not in your Plan. Price should be reasonable enough to justify the Hotel and Location.

They offer live music with complimentary hi tea, spending the evening in their beautiful terrace with a hot cup of tea and amazing music was a star experience. They also have live music during dinners with bonfire. So yes you wont get bored during the evening once you are back from sight seeing.

A delay (even if you are hospitalised - as in my case) in informing by 5 days for cancellation ends up in a loss of your hard earned money. Even the food plan for the third guest are refunded with 50% reductions which is just shameful as the third guest does not call for any special Room - forget about the food which is surely not prepared months in advance.

The place has a walking short cut which takes you to Mall Road in 10 min but it‚Äôs a steep climb while coming back.  When we went for a night stroll watchmen asked us to be back by 11 in night and told us that the path is safe and in case of any problem call the hotel will help you 24*7.

We also treated ourselves to a spa and deep tissue massage, which was well above average. Take note: although the rooms and the hotel are cosy enough, it was insanely cold outside so you will need to walk (or jog) down to the 'mall' and purchase a beenie and some extra layers before you die of cold.

Quickly points out the goods and bads:  BAD: 1. the road to the resort is risky (as one would expect in a hilly area), narrow and with lots of pot holes. 2. for reaching the reception area you will have to endure a long walk DOWN (yes, that's right) from the parking area (which basically covers the entire face of the resort) 3. a not so welcoming reception area and the walk to the rooms feels like you have entered a small Inn.  Now starts the fun. The moment you enter the room, you are hit by a blissful feeling.  GOOD: 1.

We had booked 2 superior rooms and the view from both the rooms was simply awesome. The hotel had also arranged transport for us from Kathgodam station at some cost.

Amazing view, beautifully maintained property and decent rooms. Sumptuous buffet breakfast is a must have. Otherwise, we tried Pizza which was good too. The location is far off from Mall Road but they provide free cab service to Mall Road. An improvement area would be Hospitality.

You'll be relying on luck if you want a good view in a superior room. Personally, I would spend some more $$ if i could and get a better hotel!  The evening ambiance is lively. They have a complementary transport service to downtown Nainital, which ends at 8pm (which is not sufficient. It should be till 10 pm. If you want to soak up the city, you want to stay out late and - you don't want to walk back uphill to the hotel - which gets very tiring).

The staff gave us an overwhelming response. Very courteous and quick too.  A small incidence - Kids were eating ice cream in the restaurant. The spoon was too big for their small mouth. The staff person (in his old age) went fast and brought small spoons for them. And kids had a big smile on their face. What else do you want :)  The hotel is a bit far away from mall road.

The only flip side is for elderly as they have to climb stairs everytime they want to go out of the hotel. However, the willing staff can take care of that as they provide chair lift to elderly. They even have a shuttle to and fro mall road in case you don't have your own vehicle. They provide free parking for your vehicle as well. Overall, I would rate the experience as very good.",NeerajTravels,/Profile/neerajtravels2019,"Ghaziabad, India",40

A side note, don't go after the lake facing or any expensive category rooms. They have ample sit outs and you can get wonderful views from everywhere. Garden facing rooms on the ground floor right next to the fountain are the best.  One feedback, that the rooms weren't so ventilated even after the AC was on.

This place is best for people looking for complete silence far from the crowd of Nainital itself as this Hotel is little away from the Mall road. Nice property indeed. Pick and drop service given by Hotel.   But i was not expecting a Tea/ cold drink in the welcome drink. There are various better options. The snacks that we ordered in the evening in our room were full of oil and were not up to mark. The dinner was also not of the level we have anticipated.   But to our utter surprise, we have absolutely fantastic breakfast in the morning. Everything from Dosa, ommlettes, etc was superb! May be the chef in morning was different.

bageshwar,"Going to Naintal in the Summers is never a good idea. And you could do much worse than Naini retreat. Good points- it has a beautiful courtyard, clean rooms, spacious enough for small children. Cons: Some staff in the leisure hotels chain believe in making the guest feel like an erring student boarder rather than welcome guest. The F&B manager actually told me that I should not have mixed cold milk in my coffee instead of hot, it made me feel awful enough to leave it it on the counter, and he seemed pleased with himself. And then there is the case of loud, synthesiser music along with screechy singing in the evenings that pervades every inch of the place.

Tasteful bedrooms, an intimate dining room overlooking the valley, a well-equipped fitness center, a huge conference hall and the view of the Himalayas go towards the makings of a complete experience. it has a lot of sight seeing options in and around this place. the food is very good with a huge breakfast spread. a lot of day trips and over night trips can be made keeping this as base also. the living is comfortable and high;y recomended if you'r organising a family reunion.",Rishabh Sanghvi,/Profile/renovatio,Kolkata,50

bageshwar,"I stayed at The Naini Retreat with my son last week as part of a two week visit to India. We were there for two days - I really wish that it could have been longer. We had a 'Standard' room which was of a good size. The bathroom was large and there was always hot water. Our room opened out onto a central courtyard. we had our own small patio where we could sit and relax, surrounded by roses and listening to the fountain playing. In the evening the hotels' terraces were beautifully lit and the view over the lake was magical. The food was excellent. On our last morning we had to leave very early. This was no problem for the staff who prepared and served us all that we required - and made my son a very large sandwich for the journey!

bageshwar,"Hi,  I visited Naini Retreat in Dec during X-Mas time. We had our highs and lows at this hotel.   Food was great here. The rooms were small. The linen wasnt that clean. The hot water doesnt run for 24 hours. Its more of a 3 star property than a 5 star or 4 star.   The staff was very cooperative though. The beds were small. Had a problem sleeping with my 5 month old daughter on the bed.   Wasnt too comfortable and not too great for the value of money as I thought it was overpriced for such quality. Not such a great property if you are looking for lavishness.  Anyways, have fun and live with Passion !",Prashant,/Profile/prashantgarg78,"Kolkata, India",30

The hotel Naini is also having great hospitality and the service  was really good, we had booked standard room , but after reaching there , we got information that Hamara Holiday had already upgraded our rooms to Deluxe room without any extra charges, we never knew this also happens these days ,Our trip was so lovely and memorable , we will go again & again to naini retreat.",MsAsin,/Profile/MsAsin,New Delhi,50

bageshwar,"Naini Retreat is an excellent hotel in Nainital. It is very well done up, and the rooms are excellent, especially the duplex. The food is nice and well priced. A package with dinner included, is not a bad option. An outdoor meal  by the bonfire, on a cold winter evening is something you could expect there.  The Hotel is not the closest to the main town i.e. mall road, but then it is worth going there for the lovely view it offers. The beauty of a hillstation is in its geenery and natural environment, which is a minus for hotels on the mall road. So being a little far off is not a bad option. You can use the hotel's shuttle service but you rather take a walk through the short cut. Sure its a little tiring, but is worth it .

Luckily room had side sitting area near window where I had to sleep in night. Room size also doesnot permit extra bed. Food served in buffet, quality was average and waiters in the restaurant were ill trained except Mr Harish. We also had difficulty in getting things done from kitchen for our kid like washing of bottles, boiling of outside packet milk etc as our kid was not taking hotel milk.

The hotel is located amidst the beautiful hill slopes and the view of Nainital from there is wonderful. We had a one night stay in Naini Retreat as we had to head for Almora the next day,however the night we spend there was really good and fun filled. There were games like Housie and lottery conducted by the hotel staff and I should say that it was the best experience we had in the hotel.There was a barbecue and the games were held openly with kebabs and other delights being served  frequently.It only added to the great experience we had.The children were  really enjoying their maximum and the bar was also good.

The interiors are warm and cozy with ample of light. The cottages open on one side to the hotel lobby and on the opposite side to a small enclosed square which has a very impressive flowering plants and a small sitout. From this enclosed square, there are winding steps (bordered by flowering daisies)leading to the resturant on the first floor. The resturant had a lot of paintings depicting some historic events and people; so its a pleasure to browse through the paintings on the wall when you wait for your food to arrive. Food is above average.  One evening there was an open air barbeque with a live band",samirwaghu,/Profile/samirwaghu,Mumbai,50

Hotel is slightly far away from the Mall Road but they do provide regular drop and pickup service, though you may have to wait for 15-20 minutes to get it.  Appearance of the hotel is soothing and it is old world charm. Foyer and the restaurant is elegant but we found rooms, bathroom and size of the bed too small. Garden area, bar and the square next to it are neatly done up and are an attraction of this property.  Staff was helpful and food was also good. Only thing missing is any activity for children (we went with our 3 year old daughter). Sound insulation in the rooms leaves a lot to be desired and hence if you have noisy children next door, you may miss sound sleep.

bageshwar,"Stayed in this hotel for 2 days and I have to say that it is an excellent place to relax and the place is very cozy.  Hotel: located on the hill so gets chilly at night, I visited during summer time so imagine on winter time.    There is a fire place at night outside and we can eat and drink outside, so very nice.  The city of Nainital is very small though, not much else to see, unless you are into handicraft which they are good at, the rest are cheap Chinese goods which we can get plenty back home.  Food are priced reasonably since most of the tourists are local Indians so they have to priced accordingly.  2 nights of stay here is enough because more than that, then we could be bored since besides horse riding, enjoying the quiet time, there's not much else thing to do.
