bageshwar,"We were to travel by road from Kathgudam to Munsiyari. The drive being over 10 hrs, we had decided to take a break on the way and we chose to stay at Bageshwar KMVN TRH. Prior booking has to be made - we did it on line.   We reached there in the evening after a train journey from Delhi to Kathgudam and then by car to Bageshwar.   Rooms are nice - spacious with good beds.  We were provided with a room on the first floor. It was cold that evening - there were enough blankets to ensure our comfort. We forwent our dinner as we were very tired.  On the following morning we had a good warm bath - a large geyser is provided in the toilet.  We had our breakfast the next morning in the dining hall and left for the local temples en-route to Munsiyari.  Proper attention would have made",samirganguli,/Profile/samirganguli,"Kolkata District, India",30
