bageshwar,"Stayed for two nights with family. This hotel has all the amenities you would expect from any luxury hotel but what sets it apart is its staff and the food. Never before have I ever seen such helpful and friendly staff. Right from the person who carries the luggage upto your room to the amazing chef. The food served to us couldnt be any tastier. The winter snow, clear view of snow covered peaks like Nanda Devi and absolute calm environment were just some of the add-ons which made the stay an absolute delight.",KAS,/Profile/kaifahmed85,,50
bageshwar,The Kumaon range has a strange hypnotic effect on you and when you return back to the plains you will never be the same.when I first set foot on Te Aroha in a distant and lesser known Dhanachuli I had no idea that would put a spell on me .Coming back to the  property it is everything a mountain lover can wish for.i went in December for added measure because I truly feel the snow capped peaks are at their( to me they have a living entity) elemental best during winter and the small mountain village of Dhanachuli come alive with the sound and activities  of  everyday chores of mountain people and the different flora and fauna that the place has to order.

Upon arrival, after a long 8 hour drive, we were told that, since a deluxe room would require an extra bed, we were being upgraded, for free to a 'family suite', aka, The Guest House. It was a two bedroom suite, with one small dingy room and a large spacious, well-lit room, with a floor-to-ceiling window. It was very close to the cafe, which was both good and bad as everything we said and did in the balcony was easily seen from almost any part of the hotel.

We had earlier booked the attic but the staff upon our arrival was kind enough to show guest room also which was available..after checking both the rooms we chose the guest room as it was more comfortable for us.

I had heard of the breath-taking beauty and exotic cuisines of the mountains of Kumaon and of the valleys at the base of the Himalayan range close to Nainital, and I couldn’t wait for the moment when I would feast my eyes (and palate) on them. Dhanachuli lies ensconced at the very top of those hills… a tiny little place with hamlets all around, the stone houses reminiscent of a different era.  The winding hills of Kumaon and the Hills that hold the myriad towns (some still not featured on the map of India), are magical.

There is nothing special about the location, as it literally sits on the corner of the highway. The views of course are beautiful from the hotel rooms. But to call this a hotel would be a mistake. Te Aroha is an experience. It takes you into an era of colonial bungalows. Painstakingly designed with attention to minute details it stays true to its theme of “down the memory lane”.

We knew that around dhanachuli, there is not much to see, but since we were coming from nainital, we wanted a bit of peace and 'nothing to do time'. As we checked in, we were greeted by a wonderful set of courteous staff and without any hassle was guided to our room (master bedroom). The room was unbelievable and having a private courtyard/garden and a sitting area and a view to die for! soon as we settled, the owner, Mr. Sumant came and gave us a tour of the entire property including the suites! I have no words to describe the amazing suites this place has. One should definitely stay here.  The staff knew that we were cold",Abhishek B,/Profile/abhi122,"Kolkata, India",40
bageshwar,It had snowed in Dhanachuli on the day we arrived. While driving up from Gurgaon we were debating whether we should continue with our trip because the snow would have made the roads around Dhanachuli slippery and not easy to drive. With some encouragement from the Te Aroha staff and guts we went ahead and were glad we did. The powdery snow covered the greenery all around and the roads too were covered in white. It was white as far as our eyes could see and it was beautiful. travails. We had caught the first. Combine this with the bright yellow tinned roofs of Te Aroha. I couldn't have imagined a merrier December! One look at the property and we forgot our travel  Add to the prettiness the exemplary service.

After 6h by train from Delhi and 2h tiring drive from Kathgodam station we arrived to Te Aroha and were welcomed by the whole team:) It happend that we were the only guests staying in Te Aroha so we really got a royal treatment. We were shown few rooms and we could choose one which was lovely Attic room.  Everything in the room and the hotel was perfect: decor, views, cleanliness. Although nights were cold we didn't feel it because of bottles with hot water which were placed in our bed every evening. During the day it was really sunny and warm so we would enjoy strolls in the village and then lunch served outdoors. Since we purchased a package both breakfast and dinner were included in the price.

bageshwar,"Dhanachuli: Where Address becomes Rendezvous         Taking a break from unequivocally detestable cacophony and katzenjammer, I along with my spouse set forward for Dhanachuli en route to Kathgodam. As the train chugged into Kathgodam, the weather still seemed warm for the foothills of the Shivalik range. The hundred-minute car ride from the station for Dhanachuli wasn’t any cooler than the searing northern plains but exhilarating none the less as the giant and gorgeous hills were beckoning. Soon after Bhimtal and just as I was about to resign to the loss of paradise, the setting started to transform. And then came a moment of instant gratification, the plains metamorphosed and we were engrossed by the awe-inspiring scenic pulchritude. The fresh hill breeze seemed like heaven’s",Dipmart,/Profile/Dipmart,Delhi,50

No TV in the clean comfortable rooms, so all your time is yours, but if you can't live without your daily dose of soaps there is one in a common area.

The bathrooms are also very clean. The view is breathtaking. The best thing is the staff and service.they made us feel very comfortable.the word no and impossible is not their in dictionary.whatever we asked for was possible for them.we had really started wondering is it that they cant say no or that they can do evrything you ask them.

It's a nice romantic getaway. but it's not just romantic. This boutique hotel is done up really well...lot of magazines, books, artefacts to keep one engaged. There are no TVs in the rooms, but there is a TV lounge and a well stocked library. This is one holiday where a good nights sleep is guaranteed. The hotel provides pick and drop to the nearest railway station. Availing the cab service, from the railway station, is a good idea, as it is a bit difficult to locate the place if you are going there for the first time.

We came to know about Te Aroha from some common links. At first honestly we were skeptical about visiting this place. No mall roads, no shops, no TV in the rooms....phew.....it was tough decision specially when you have a family who loves crowded places to shop, eat and roam around :-). We took the decision to give it a shot and booked 2 rooms w/o telling much about the place to our families but keeping our fingers Xed !!

As I sit in Delhi a few days later, I can't help but feel glad that we decided to stay at Te Aroha. The resort is nestled in Dhanachuli, a place so far unspoilt by too many tourists. The only thing around the resort is the tiny local market, with a sprawl of a couple of shops. However, it's proximity to Mukteshwar means that you can drive down there in about half an hour, and do some trekking, temple visiting, bakery hopping etc etc.  Now for the place itself. it is unlikely that you'll find Te Aroha's name splashed across advertisements.

bageshwar,"Te Aroha is a place which you perhaps will not find amidst the usual clutter of advertisements by various resorts and hotels. I guess it wasnt meant to because it just wanted to stand out and did not need to be advertised at all.   THe house of love (as it means in the maori language) far exceeds what one expects and grows on you as you start to unwind in its luxury and get pampered. In a nut shell the place is just perfect if you want to disconnect, enjoy the natural beauty of the mountains, the chilly weather, cozy interiors and ofcourse if lucky the company of its very dedicated owner.   The food surprisingly was a very good variety of north indian and continental cuisine and the icing on the cake was the kumaoni dinner especially cooked for us to give a flavour of the kumaon",seemant,/Profile/seemant,"Singapore, Singapore",50

Having visited right after our wedding, we were looked after but never disturbed. The service is top-quality, the views and the rooms reminded us of resorts in the Swiss/French Alps or the Canadian Rockies, but the real clincher was the quality of the food. The Chef- Chatur Singh, could hold his own at any of the top stand-alone continental restaurants in Delhi or Mumbai, and the quality/presentation of the food was fantastic.

The weather too cooperated with us. In the afternoon we played chess and watched some movies in the Inn's DVD entertainment room. They have a nice DVD collection.

The property is mesmerizing; if you can afford a suite (preferably Master's Bedroom) then nothing like it. It's a perfect place to relax for a few days, unwind yourself, do nothing, eat well, flow with the ubiquitous silence, and lose yourself in the hills. The staff ensures you get all of this and more.   Te Aroha is clearly a work of passion by Sumant Batra, and it reflects in everything, right from welcome drink to the bathroom door handles to dining area!
