The location - in the middle of hills and forests - utter quiet 2. The cottage - warm and cosy . There was a cupboard for storage, the beds were clean and comfortable, and the bathrooms were both pretty and environment friendly. My husband and I had many cups of tea sitting in the verandah, and listening to the forest sounds.  3. Service was warm and efficient. Balu especially was very kind. 4.

Ashish and Deepa hats off to your service, smile, staff and the positive attitude. there are no timings here for anything. the place is beautiful and a labor of love for this lovely couple. the fruit trees are everywhere and are inviting. both Ashish and Deepa are doing a lot to maintain the natural surroundings and keep the place as Eco friendly as possible. no TV here(sorry) and would have been amazing if mobile signal was also not there. we were there for 3 nights in August and have already booked for November.",harbatra,/Profile/harbatra,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
bageshwar,"Frankly when I was told about this place I was not at all excited at all. Travel for hrs and stay in a very simple cottage.   But trust me I was wrong. It was worth every hr I traveled. What a breathtaking view. WOOOOOOOW  Simple place with home made food ... yummy. Staff is really warm.   Night they used to fix bonfire for us and we used to sit there for hrs looking at the stars. I heard if u go during summers u can pluck fruits from the trees directly and eat. Apple, peach , pear, plump...  Best part is the host couple they've damn sweet and friendly and make u feel like home.   I m going back again...  Muahhhh love the place",Traveling-elephants,/Profile/Traveling-elephants,"Mumbai, India",40
bageshwar,"I visited Sonapani 2 summers back. I can still close my eyes and go back to the place. I hope the Govt. is never able to complete the road leading to the resort and the last kilometre or so remains a walking track. The lack of road, sound of motors and horns and smoke was a high point of my visit. The owner family is passionate about their property. It is a happy place with tasty fresh food, attentive and smiling staff, clean rooms and great views.  They do NOT have any 'regular' hotel amenities like TV (great), Telephone in rooms (wow), SPA and Massage, evening disco, housie, in house entertainments, bar and such like. The mobile phones work but only so-so. AND this seeming lack of anything to do, is what goes to make for an ideal holiday.

bageshwar,"After a gap of four years we went back to Sonapani. We'd gone there for a nephew's wedding in 2008 and it was a revelation then. We'd wanted to go back all this time - so we finally tied up a visit to Sonapani on our way to Binsar. It was a relief to find that the quality of stay as well as the incredible hospitality that Ashish and Deepa extend was as high today as it was four years ago.   Sonapani is not at a great height - but is a secluded orchard with 12-13 cottages. You pay all inclusive - and get three massive meals a day - breakfast, lunch and dinner - but are constantly plied with food, snacks, fruit, exquisite breads and homemade jams all day. Has anyone eaten Ashish's palak (spinach) bread ? I'd never eaten it before and having done so now, can only rue the fact that",Pankaj B,/Profile/PankajButalia,"New Delhi, India",50
bageshwar,A wonderful place close to nature away from the hustle of city. We went there in June end for 3 days along with a trip to Nainital. I loved the way we could just pluck the fruits and eat them. Owners Ashish and Deepa put in a lot of efforts to maintain the natural surrounding and treat all people as family. Location: It is around 70 kms from Kathgodam railway station. It took us around 2.5hrs to reach the place. We had requested Ashish to arrange for the transport which was quite convenient. Recently they have constructed a small road/way to the place where the car (not bigger than Tavera/Innova) can be taken to the property and you don't need to walk from the parking place. It is around 6k ft above sea level similar to Nainital. Google maps marks the exact location of the,ujjwalkundra,/Profile/ujjwalkundra,"New Delhi, India",50

This place is excellent if you want to relax, spend time with yourself or your family. 12 cottages in total , all well maintained and far away so that privacy is maintained. It is a perfect place to rejuvinate yourself. The owner Ashish & Deepa treated everyone so well, we never were felt they are owners, they were like friends. The food was excellent, children were given special non spicy food. Our stomach never got upset eating the food. The package was breakfast, lunch and dinner, but they treated us like family people, after for the regular 3 meals, there was bedtea with snacks, evening tea with snack, evening soup with snacks, cold drinks on demands, and never were we charged extra for it.

One can do trekking as per choice from some gud options available. Or better Jus relax in sunlight savoring d natural delights and d fantastic view of d trishul peak. Early morning n during evenings the place becomes a mini bird sanctuary. At night one can have the bonefire group activities. Overall a great experience. However people looking for 5 star facilities shall avoid it. Staff is ultra cooperative and very courteous.food is great . The rents are pretty reasonable.

bageshwar,"We wanted to be out of the city madness for the New year eve,so were looking for some quiet place. Heard about Himalayan Village through friends decided to give it a try. After almost 9 hours drive from Delhi, we reached Sonapani around 8am. What a view it was? Sunrise.. awesome. One amazing thing about this place is its not crowded like most hill stations actually you can't call it a hill station.. its like home away from home. Himalayan village property is in the lap of the nature. Air is so fresh views awesome.. can go on and on.. Ashish (Owner) hospitality was amazing. We were lucky to be there on 31st as there were some very amazingly talented bunch of singers, actors present. had a wonderful time. We went to Mukteshwar 15kms away.

bageshwar,"All our friends (5 couples with their children) together were looking for a peaceful vacation, away from the hush-bush life of the city, at a place close to nature and greens, and were soulfully glad to have chosen  Himalayan Village, Sonapani, for our 3N4D stay. The journey was a mix of train and road transport, making it comfortable as well. The resorts have all basic necessities and no frills, very good, hygienic and homely food and lots of green. There is a 20 min walk from the parking to the resorts, initially we thought it will be very tiring, but when we eventually walked through the woods amongst trees loaded with apples, apricots, plums, and pears, we never wanted the walk to end. these trees not only surround the resort but are also found right next to you own cottage.",MonikaG17,/Profile/MonikaG17,"Gurgaon, Haryana, India",40

bageshwar,"I've been to Sonapani a couple of times this year but it was mostly just for a meal. But I finally got the chance to stay there for a few days in July 2011. The brick red cottages at Sonpani are cosy and hygienic. We enjoyed sitting outside the cottages from where we watched many different kinds of birds and moths. Ashish and Deepa who run the place are warm and chilled out folks. They made us feel very much at home. They are also very concerned about the environment and particularly passionate about conserving oak forests. The place also has a great garden with all kinds of plants and flowers. The food's also fantastic. And if I must be specific, try their potato bread and apple pie. They have extremely pleasant staff who are also delightful cooks.

The owner also stays here with his family and is a very entertaining and friendly individual. The view from the cottages is phenomenal!

In stark contrast is a lesser known destination in the Naini Tal district of Uttarakhand—Himalayan Village Sonapani, fast growing in popularity, thanks to the unique experience it offers.    Sonapani is an eight hour drive from Delhi, while the nearest railhead, Kathgodam, is accessible by an overnight train. One can request a pick up for the 2 hour uphill drive to Sonapani—a picturesque and refreshing journey on winding mountain roads bordered by tall trees, passing through popular tourist centers like Bhimtal.
