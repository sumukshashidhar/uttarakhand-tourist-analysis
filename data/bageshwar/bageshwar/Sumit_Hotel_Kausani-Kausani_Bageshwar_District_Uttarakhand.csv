bageshwar,"Visited ""Hotel Sumit"" last month...it was great holiday with friends...we all enjoyed a lot the place just because of help of hotel staff... I would like to pay my regards and special thanks to Mr. Bisht hotel manager.. He help us a lot...  Location was mind boggling you just open your window get an artistic view...

It's was an nice stay at ""Hotel Sumit """,Aditya,/Profile/Adi3210,,50
bageshwar,"I booked the hotel online, was assured of full security as there were no cottages it interconnected rooms available. We were traveling with our kids, so prefer to have the room that are really secure, but on arrival we found there was boundary around the hotel, monkey all over the place at the entrance of the room, the staff quarters, are just next to guest rooms. Even the basic amenities were missing,like the soaps were not there, were provided when asked for, the bathroom had no knob from inside, to open, or a latch.   Though the guy who served was really good and for them it's there job, the management should look into these things, as happy and satisfied guests are must to sustain a business and a happy staff",Neetu G,/Profile/neetugulati1,"New Delhi, India",20
bageshwar,"Although we booked the best category hotel it had, it was slightly disappointing. Damp walls, frog in bathroom, no basic amenities provided like towels etc. Had a balcony attached which was giving amazing view of the himalayas if clear sky. You can enjoy the sunrise from the terrace. Food was cooked fresh and very tasty. staff was not so courteous but later a small kid was serving who was very cooperative and a happy kid.",AnkurModi26,/Profile/AnkurModi26,"Kolkata, India",30
bageshwar,"I was there last week for 1 day with my family. Hotel amenities are average but view from the rooms was excellent. You can directly see the Himalaya view from your room. Food was good, staff was helpful especially the boy who was serving the food and other stuff.   I was staying at the cottage where the Wifi signal was not there but who cares about the wifi signal when you have just a nice view. I liked the overall stay and will recommend them.",Naseem,/Profile/naseem6270,,30
bageshwar,Hotel room was in good condition and rooms were spacious too. Bathroom was clear and hygienic. Surrounding of the hotel was good with a beautiful view of mountains and sunset.

bageshwar,I stayed here while traveling in a group. It is a budget hotel with great views from the hotel rooms. One can see the Himalayan peaks directly from their rooms which make for a great scene during sunset and sunrise.  The food and service is quite average  Tip: Select the room on the top floor (Rooms 201-204) as it offers better view,AnkitBa1387,/Profile/AnkitBa1387,,30
bageshwar,Very nice furniture. Pleasant stay in cottages . Superb view of Himalaya. Hotel rooms average but cottage  rooms newly constructed so well. Nice water supply. Continuous power supply. Effective room service.,Vasant2016,/Profile/Vasant2016,"Raigad, India",40
bageshwar,"It is a budget place so price wise it is good. Ok for one night halt. The food is bad. Service is slow. In tourist season there is a problem of parking and gets very noisy.  Just the view of Trishul peak from Hotel is good but you can get that view elsewhere too and there are better panaromic points to view the peaks here in Kumaon region.  They offer breakfast, lunch and dinner included packages but that limits the options of what you can eat for a particular meal and then turns out to be more expensive.  Overall it's not a great place. ",Neha B,/Profile/416nehab,,30
bageshwar,"Prons: Cottages made with wood gives natural feel. We were whole family and took all 4 cottages. Garden for playing for kids with in the property. Also gives a good view of Himalayan range. Rememberable stay in nature with peace. Cons: Zero marks for Comitment done from staff. They comitted to give all the services to the cottages, but at the time of dinner they refused to serve it to the cottages. No shampoo, toothpaste, toothbrush, almirah and tea maker in the cottage.",TripToHeaven304551,/Profile/TripToHeaven304551,"Faridabad, India",40

There was always hot water, although the actual shower did not work!

bageshwar,Their service is pathetic. Makes you cry over your decision to stay here. Rooms are filthy and the worst thing is the attitude of the manager. Am a traveller. Frequently travel but an experience like this was something I nvr faced till now. Terrible hotel in total.,Amit P,/Profile/173amitp,,10
bageshwar,"I recently stayed in this hotel to experience the worst part of hospitality.   This hotel only has 10 rooms in the entire property given to it's manager Mr.Yogesh to spoil their customer's vacation. There is no water coming to the last cornered room of this hotel and no hot water in the entire property thought they have geysers in bathrooms. My booking was made for 12 people on MAP with 4 extra beds and I was quoted for 1600 Rs. for extra person.  Later I understood that it was only for food & not for extra bed.  That too I was served only Daal, Rice, Chapatis & a Subji in dinner.  He did not even bother to ask me for our preference. He & his restaurant staff gave me a bed tea for 8 people & deducted that from breakfast.  That again was only poori bhaji and nothing of my choice.",sanjayskadam,/Profile/sanjayskadam,Pune,10

bageshwar,"One of the best places to stay at Kausani. The hotel is located only about 300 mtrs from the main bazaar. Take the right hand side road from the main chowk alongside the police chowki. Its a clean hotel and the staffs are very cordial and helpful. You are guaranteed to get unhindered view of the snow clad Himalayan ranges with peaks like Nandadevi, Nandakhat, Trisul and more on a clear day from the hotel. The top floor rooms are better with attached balconies. One can relax and enjoy the panorama right form the rooms.

bageshwar,"Traveled with a friend in Feb 2009. Was very cold there. As hotel was new no geyser in room, room service gave us hot bucket of water. Food was good although a bit overpriced wrt the place. They helped us get a cab for local sightseeing also. Run by a retired ITBP person.   When we were there, there was a leopard attack at night on a pet dog, and nearby forests a tiger killed a woman. Good that the owner gave us this info as and when it happened and asked us not to roam out after sunset. Without him we may not have known and anything could have happened.",Sourabh_Dhar,/Profile/Sourabh_Dhar,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
bageshwar,"I had booked Super Deluxe Rooms from Cleartrip. When I reached the hotel, they gave us the ground floor rooms first. When I confronted them saying I have booked Super Deluxe Room & should get the first floor room (which has a balcony for enjoying the view), the manager lied to my face that the rooms on the ground floor are super deluxe & the ones above are ""luxury"". I knew no ""luxury rooms"" existed here from their own website lisitng & cleartrip/mmt listing.  Then When I asked him to show me where are the ""deluxe"" rooms, he lied one step further and said its in a separate building some metres away from this one, to which I said that fine I want to see those. Of course he had no building to show.  Finally having been caught lying straight to my face, he agreed to give the 1st",Saurabh R,/Profile/316saurabhr,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",20

bageshwar,"Hotel Sumit Kausani is situated at an excellent location, and commands a transcendental view of the sun rising over Himalaya. After check in, the first thing one would notice is the overwhelming serenity of the place.

bageshwar,"The hotel is ideally located for great views of snowy mountains. The rooms on the first floor are well suited and the lower rooms do not have a very good view. However, intermittent power cuts and absence of room heaters makes stay in the hotel a very daunting task during peak winters. The staff of the hotel is very friendly, but this same warmth is not extended by one Mr. Negi, who is connected to the establishment. Look out for one Mr. Puran Singh who is an gentleman and goes out of his way to make the stay of customers a memorable one. The dining facilities are average. Kitchen usage terms are not very transparent and therefore at the time of final billing one may suddenly find unknown hidden / uninformed charges have crept in to the bill.

The hotel has a nice terrace but it will include if you stay at super delux rooms.  The Hotel manager ""Puran Singh"" is a very nice person and also the staffs are very good and helpful.

Nice bed, clean bathroom and a huge window for excellent view. We stayed at ground floor. Room at 1st floor has a balcony and costs 200 INR extra. Amenities in hotel are basic but comfortable. Food was good but kitchen does not open before 7 AM. Hotel staff would wake you up 5:30 in morning by knocking the door endlessly so that you don't complain them for missing the sun rise :)  You may go to the open terrace to view sunrise.

If you stay somewhere and come to this hotel only during sunrise, you can pay to get access to the terrace.  Con: The staff is arrogant, did not recognize the booking done on one of the travel site although we were carrying the printouts, the hotel has some intermediary that works with travel agents and then the travel agents have a liaise with the websites. He (the reception desk person) first confirmed the booking by talking to 4-5 people over phone. The language he used was abusive and did not suit for a person in the tourism industry.
