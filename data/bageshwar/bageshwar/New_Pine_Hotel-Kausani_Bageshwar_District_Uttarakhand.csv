bageshwar,"There are 3 hotels in the same campus, kausani retreat, new pine and maitri homes all properties of single owner managed by different managers, we had booking in kausani retreat, they have total 37 rooms in all 3 hotels. They show pics of only the best rooms which are only 5 in number and take bookings of 37 rooms. Kausani retreat are complete cheaters... the photos on make my trip and goibibo are misleading... Your experience gets even worse once you start interacting with them. Foul mouthed manager putting blame on agent in Delhi who manages online listings. When we mentioned about filling a FIR with police station, their whole behaviour changed. But that could not make up for overall bad experience. Please be away from these hotels. Less said is better about this experience.",MaheshSKabra,/Profile/MaheshSKabra,"Pune, India",10

bageshwar,"behavior of manager was tooooo bad. He did not even know how to talk with a human being even a lady. Food quality was so so,quantity was very low for a single person. Room was not so much good as charged from any one.",Biswajit K,/Profile/BiswajitK48,,10

But u can hv some lack of sunlight in the early morninh.And I can't hv a nice view of sun or mountain scenery as it is situated in the other side of the hill.",Reek D,/Profile/reekd2016,,40

bageshwar,"I visited Kausani in May 2017 with my wife.  Both senior senior citizens nearing 65 years.  V were given rooms in third floor, with no proper staircase, all broken.  Was difficult to reach and once u reach, difficult to come down.  No in house restaurant, a restaurant in side hotel was also catering to their needs.   Did not get dinner in time, order was given by me at 5.oo p.m. and dinner served at 9.00 p.m.  Will not recommend  to anyone,.",Madan P,/Profile/madanpande,"New Delhi, India",20
bageshwar,25Dec2016 - The hotel is new and I found only our family staying. Probably this happened as they have no view. You have to walk 200 metres near the market to get a view. The staff was good. Food was brought from a different hotel by the staff. Food in Kausani overall is not so good. The hotel is quite economical. Rooms are not too spacious for good for a night.,Subhojit C,/Profile/subhojitc500,"Kolkata, India",30
bageshwar,"We were truly satisfied this hotel rooms and loved the location but we were disappointed for improper functioning of the following: i.	Hot water was not available. ii.	No  water filter was existing. iii.	Preparation of food is not at all up to our mark.  Overall, It is a budget hotel for enjoyable stay.

bageshwar,"We had a good stay at this hotel. The staff are so nice and went out of their way to help us. Our room was basic but fine. There was no real shower, just a tap and a jug, but the staff did offer us hot water if we wanted it. Good location just 5 minutes from Kausani centre with lovely views over the hills. We got up at 5am to watch sunrise a walk away in Kausani and would definately recommend to do that! ",Sophie K,/Profile/SophWK,,30
bageshwar,I visited the hotel for the second time. The managemnt has totally changed probaly it is now owned by some proffessionals. All toilets r western nd mordenised.

bageshwar,Dont stay here if you offered to stay for free... Terrible rooms... I guess attendant lady has hired child labors... Room service is terrible ... Everything here is terrible... Room is not having CHARGING SLOTS... TOILET AND BATHROOM are  UNCOMFORTABLE... When we visited we were the only guests there from last 3 months... You will also feel like ghost mention because of 90rooms they have... That lady incharge is very rude... And not even care whether we want anything or not...  DON'T STAY HERE EVEN IF YOU STAYIN FOR FREE ,Zarna P,/Profile/340zarnap,,10

bageshwar,"The entry to the hotel has a very sharp rising ramp which can cause accidental falling any time to aged and disabled family members. Hot water from boiler with smoky smell is available only for one hour 7am to 8am, but no where it is disclosed. Room height very low. No plug point for recharging phone or camera, if you do so you have to remove TV connection from the plug. Useless spending money by staying here. According to the facilities  and room conditions there is no reason for such high price displayed to the website.",pradip_maitiar,/Profile/pradip_maitiar,,10
bageshwar,"It is a very good and comfortable hotel situated in the lush green mountains covered with dense Banj Oak and pine forests and affords a breath taking view and it welcomes the visitors in a very cordial manner. Good place to enjoy vacations with family, friends and also group as the hotel is very big having 90 rooms to stay. Also the food is good and makes you feel like home. We stayed there for a couple of days during June 15. It is conveniently located as the variety of attractions like Anasakti Ashram, tea garden, shawl factory, Baijnath Temple, Rudrahari Mahadev Temple, Rudrahari Falls and Caves, Laxmi Ashram and many centre of attractions are nearby.",kamalbisht22,/Profile/kamalbisht22,"Lucknow, India",40

bageshwar,"A very bad experience. Beginning with the entrance, there are no proper stairs, the old stairs were converted into a very unscientific ramp, anyone can fall down anytime you enter or leave the hotel. The Super deluxe room were very ill maintained, dust everywhere, washroom were so dirty, felt as if deserted for months, the intercom not working at all, neither is there a bell. Nothing called room service is available. Hot water is available only for 2 hrs from 6 a.m to 8 a.m. The Deluxe room were shabby as well. The jug and glasses kept in the room were washed God knows when??? There is no restaurant of  their own, they share it with a nearby hotel but do not get involve with it. One has to pay and eat, then and there directly, moreover the restaurant is very costly and not worth",Caesai,/Profile/Caesai,"Kolkata, India",10
bageshwar,"It was late, we called the management at 11 pm and they were ready to help. They served us hot water as the weather was chilling and rooms are very well made.

bageshwar,"It seems it has 90 rooms, we were the only occupants of this hotel (off season was just ending). We were doubtful if this was the place as reception (like a bunk shop) was closed and not even a crow. We can't drive to the entrance of the hotel as to reach there u need to climb steep stairs (they are constructign a steep slope). Service : OK..Hot water is an issue. Small rooms but neat. Open space in front of all rooms. We did not have a great experience with the hotel staff.",DeekAKGAG,/Profile/DeekAKGAG,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",30
bageshwar,"Stayed here on the way to garur and I found the place pretty good for the cost they are charging. The food was also very decent. In fact, we liked their pori bhaji. I would recommend this as a good budget hotel. What I did not like was lack of proper ventilation, the windows were shut permanently",nandanbhayera,/Profile/nandanbhayera,"New Delhi, India",50

bageshwar,"Hi All,  New Pine is the single largest hotel in Kausani with 90 rooms. So, in case of rush its a good choice. The staff is very co-operative as in one incident I forgot my first anniversary watch in the hotel room, found out the next day in Nainital. The owner confirmed me later and managed her way out of his busy schedule to send it to me in Lucknow.  Thankyou Ms.Kavita Bisht for doing the needful.",Shakeys1511,/Profile/Shakeys1511,LKO,30
bageshwar,There are no big tile flooring in the corridors no big plush receptions...no luxurious furniture.......  But best thing about this 90 rooms hotel is the warmth their staff shows during your stay. Though no marble flooring is there...but neatly cleaned rooms give you a homely feel in this small village Kausani..... The owners of the hotel.... give personal attention to all the guests.....My wife and Our son got so friendly with one partner owner Miss Kavita Bisht...I attach a pic of my wife son and Miss Kavita playing bedminton in the court built within the hotel.......

bageshwar,"It claims to have 90 room,  undoubtedly this is one of the biggest in the small town of Kusani. But they have made the rooms little smaller to accommodate the count, but they will serve your purpose.It will give you very nice view of the valley, but if you want to see Himalayan range from your room, this is not the place you want to be. Though they claim, they do not have any in-house restaurant, once you order from their Menu, they will bring it from outside. People are helpful & courteous towards guests. I will recommend to exercise this option for budget stay.",souvik_gh2005,/Profile/souvik_gh2005,"Pune, India",30
