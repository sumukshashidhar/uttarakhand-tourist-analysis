bageshwar,"It might look beautiful in the pictures but it's the exact opposite of it. The the management was extremely poor in their services and were not even ready to accept their flaws and the manager behaved so rudely when we told them that their services were not up to the mark. The water taps were not working, the food was horrible and it's not worth the money at all. Instead of this, visit krishna mountview, that is beautiful",Lavanya Tejwani,/Profile/Lavanya_22,,10
bageshwar,Worst hotel they did fraud with my mom dad. So ridiculous. We booked superdelux hotel with travel agency. My mom dad reached there and he gave those rooms to other guest and gave another worst room instead. Having dead cockroaches and no windows for ventilation.  This kind of hotel should have punished.,Rohan Z,/Profile/rohanz504,,10
bageshwar,"We stayed there on ground floor deluxe rooms for one day during visit to kausani. It seems a good budget hotel. Direct view of Himalayan ranges from the room is biggest selling point. We got glimpse of snow peaks only in the morning 5:30 at sunrise. It's on Baijnath road n very near, walkable to kausani shawl factory. But you can prefer hotel at high altitude to get undisturbed view. Rooms are average, bathrooms are huge equivalent to a room. Food is good but they have a small restaurant place which gets crowded when more people come for food at a time. Solar hot water did not work n they provided us a couple of buckets of hot water. They charged for Driver stay n food separately. This was weired to me as I did not pay such charges in any of the other four hotels we stayed.",vinay,/Profile/vinayv354,"Mumbai, India",30
bageshwar,The amenities are very poor..No Gyser are there and hot water is only available from 7:30 am to 9 am through buckets as solar boilers we're  not working.. The management is very poor.. At night light was not and whole hotel was in dark as generator was also not working..there athough the staff is helpful..would not recommend you to visit this hotel..,Anubhav A,/Profile/3anubhava,,10
bageshwar,It's a cheap lodge type hotel. Hotel service is very poor. Because of season hotel have good rush but no varieties of breakfast .bread was hard and they make poha 2to 3 time. They should know there are no other breakfast. The room is without t.v.. The main door lock and toylate flush lever was broken. There's no restaurant nearby. Avoid to stay here.,shashankpatel p,/Profile/shashankpatelp,"Greenville, North Carolina",20
bageshwar,The place is nice and tidy. Staff is energetic and cooperative. Rooms are spacious and well maintained. Food is simple and good..Can be more tasty.. View from the hotel is awesome and located in a peaceful place.,Ishaan Sharma,/Profile/ishaan7896,"Noida, India",40
bageshwar,"The lady at the reception is not at all helpful, only interested in charging more and more money. Hot water is not available at any point of the day. Bed sheets are dirty and no room service is available. Only few rooms have a mountain view. And they charge more money for those rooms even if you have booked in advance.",anjali91d,/Profile/anjali91d,"New Delhi, India",10

bageshwar,"We had booked hotel hill palace after shortlisting it through the photographs on web sites. we even paid the advance for two rooms. But when we arrived, we were offered rooms without even a window. The rooms were really small and pathetic. However they have only a few rooms with valley view, which they had promised. So we decided not to stay here and reception staff was very cordial to understand the position and instantly refunded our advance money we had transferred online.  We appreciate this gesture from the staff, as now a days many hotels try to be cheat people during season at every given opportunity. ",skagarwal74,/Profile/skagarwal74,"Bhopal, India",30
bageshwar,"We had a booking in this hotel through a top of the country travel agent but decided not to stay after checking in. The rooms are small & dirty. Beds are hard & also dirty. Non a/c rooms. No mountain view is available. Food is also poor. The hotel is pathetic, below standard one. Also it is located at 5 km away from the Gandhi Ashram & proper kausani. It is not recomended to stay at this hotel if leisure & luxury is considered.",sangita1234,/Profile/sangita1234,,10

bageshwar,The hotel location Is fine. But service is not upto the mark. In one word if i have to say all i xan say is just inagine if a group of guest if comes to tour home then what will be your situation the same way these people will react and service. They tey hard but then they are not professional.  Himalyan mountain view you can see from hotel roof top only if you are lucky. That goes with anyother hotel in kausani. Coz thats nature. Lastly avoid this hotel if u can coz its not worth the prize u pay.,ash138,/Profile/ash138,mumbai,20
bageshwar,"Its a new property hence a lot of teething problems I guess. However the biggest problem is privacy. All rooms are clearly visible form the road hence curtains need to be drawn at all time. The best rooms have windows opening to the inside of the hotel. A little weird to say the least. The staff though very sweet does not have a clue about what they are supposed to do. The food though good,was very spicy which can be very rough on the stomach after a while. Had planned to stay there for 4 days but left after two. It could be a very nice property if done up well.",zangz,/Profile/zangz,"Calcutta, West Bengal, India",30
bageshwar,"The Hotel location is best because of view point, rooms & bathrooms are spacious, clean but there is a suffocation without fan. We visited with family and have two rooms on ground floor for parents and three on first floor with one room 205 for view. The hotel decor is good but there is some suggestions for hotel, the staff is not sufficient, there is no proper cook the staff of 7-8 boys doing all things like cleaning,serving cooking etc. The owner is helpful but she did not handle properly all things. There is a mistake in out bill for Rs.2500 so I just want to say the property,location everything is good but we don't like brk-fast & dinner so much, there is need to be improvement.Hotel is good for stay & if anyone can want to take brf-fast, lunch or dinner just go uphill in",neena_12,/Profile/neena_12,"New Delhi, India",30
bageshwar,Have been to hill palace Kausani nice hotel. Spacious rooms with Himalaya view. Truly magical just sip in ur hot cup of coffee n view ice covered Himalaya from comfort of ur room. Room service nice. Owner of hotel very co operative. Food a bit spicy but nice. Owner allowed us to use their kitchen for my Lil one. Just hot water was problem not available 24 hrs but yes would b available on request. You can enjoy beauty of magical sunrise from your hotel itself no need to go to some sunrise point. Located 3km from Kausani on bageshwar road. Opp to shawl factory  If you bargain well they R happy to give you good deal. Just one problem hotel should put net on windows so in evening also we can enjoy fresh air in hotel room or mosquitoes n insects are problem in evening. Kausani is a,msangoi,/Profile/msangoi,,40
bageshwar,though hotel has a good location it has not even half of the amenities it promised. No wifi not even mobile network! Forget outside contact. Very poor room service. Rooms have no privacy. Corridors outside your windows. Some rooms open into the reception lobby and are open to all. Only rooms like 105 r good.  Manager lady is single handedly working herself. Rest all staff is incompetent.  Food is bad. No fans in hotel. Rooms may get hot in summer and kids get highly irritable. Simple amenities like tea kettle in room are absent although advertised.  For even milk for kids u have to go to kitchen yourselves.  Avoid this hotel. Many other hotels with same price n better facilities available. Not even one star!!,Drdevjyoti,/Profile/Drdevjyoti,,20
bageshwar,We stayed here for 1 night. Hotel is nicely located. It seems its a new property. Sad part about the location is data connectivity is very poor. Hotel does not have wifi connectivity    Nice clean rooms with Hot Water. Has a good restaurant and good food. We really enjoyed the food quality. You got a good view of the Himalayan peaks from this hotel. There is also a small Tea Garden where you can go.   Rooms are little small without any storage space. So you will have to keep your luggage in the room . TV is a little too small. There is a walking space behind the room and staff walk so there is no 100% privacy (Since the curtains are not too big). Room no 205 had a good view of the mountains.  I had 1 big problem with the Hotel owner (Suman Srivastava). In the 1st floor Balcony,SameerPrasad,/Profile/SameerPrasad,"Thane, India",30
