The view from its room and terrace is superb. It was really great stay and room service was prompt & staff are very helpful. The hotel manager is very nice person, cordial and always ready to help. Hotel rooms are quit well and washroom is up to the mark. Open Dinning space is very close to Nature but it needs to be more cleaned and decorated.

The hotel does not have a proper restaurant area instead the food is served in the open area covered with shade. Food quality is also average. This area has good view of the lake too.
