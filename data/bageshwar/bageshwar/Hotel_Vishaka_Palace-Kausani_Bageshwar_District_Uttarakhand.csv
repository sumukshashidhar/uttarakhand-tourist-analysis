bageshwar,"I visited Uttarakhand with family and friends and Kausani was one of our destinations staying at this Hotel for one night. The views from this hotel Balconies is Gorgeous but these views are available almost everywhere in kausani, so that is not really a speciality to boast of. Coming to the cleanliness in the rooms, it was bad. The sheets, blankets, pillows were all stained. The staff was non-co-operative except for one guy, Manish. There was this unwanted attitude in the entire staff. Food was extremely expensive and of very poor quality. The staff went to sleep at 10 making it amply clear that they do not  intend to be disturbed.",Vivek Jindal,/Profile/VJIndia1206,,20

bageshwar,"This hotel for me was superb! Attentive staff and breakfast on the balcony enjoying the sun , valley below and the stunning scenery. The room price was excellent and I ordered food off menu. Compliments to the chef for the fine dinners he prepared. The hotel is a walk from the center, but worth it and good exercise. I am 69 and loved the setting of the hotel with many exploring options around. The manager speaks english and some of the staff. Lots of blankets as nights were cold. Kausani and this hotel were a highlite of my 5 month trip.",travellinggranny71,/Profile/travellinggranny71,"North Vancouver, Canada",50

bageshwar,"Food choices can be limiting due to its reasonably remote location however, it tastes and feels like homemade. Room service although very courteous tends to be slow. Room rates are on the lower side when compared to hotels in the vicnity while rooms are basic but very clean. Rooms are cozy due to loads of wooden work and prefer taking the valley facing room as the view there is simply awesome.",bharat b,/Profile/178bharatb,"Noida, India",50
bageshwar,The hotel is located far inside the forest with no nearby shops for options. Rooms are huge but food is extremely poor. Service is OK but requires a lot of improvement. Picturesque scenery are available from the room.,sagarsamaddar,/Profile/sagarsamaddar,"Kolkata, India",40

bageshwar,"Visited Kausani from 17.06.2015 to 19.06.2015 with my family.  Since it was my first visit to Kausani, I called the Hotel to guide me.  In fact, Hotel staff reached the market place to assist.  Tiredness of travel vanished as soon as we reached the hotel and received with warm greetings, tea for me & my wife, Ice-cream for kids.  The Hotel has ample parking, delicious food, all modern amenities, caring staff and above all situated at a serene place with the most beautiful view to see the sunrise from our room itself. Charges are quite economical.  Main tourist spots of Kausani are well within reach from Hotel Vishaka.   Kids are planning to revisit Kausani and stay at Hotel Vishaka Palace, particularly to relish the taste of awesome Spring Rolls.",ChetanChawla16,/Profile/ChetanChawla16,"New Delhi, India",50

bageshwar,"Visited the Hotel with family and friends.on 16th November 2015. I had booked a trip through make my trip. We were 8 of us. The location of the hotel is good. You get to see the view of the Himalayan Range. However, though the Hotel was relatively empty, still they gave us rooms on the first floor where the view is restricted. When we requested, the hotel staff upgraded the room to the top floor by paying extra charges. My only point is if the hotel was emtpy, why did they not give us the room which had a good view in the first place? Anyways, the stay was peaceful and the staff very co-operative, specially Mr. Kapil, who was always there to help and guide us. Food quality is not up to the mark and needs to be improved drastically. You have no option but to eat at the Hotel as",bspaul,/Profile/bspaul,Thane,30
