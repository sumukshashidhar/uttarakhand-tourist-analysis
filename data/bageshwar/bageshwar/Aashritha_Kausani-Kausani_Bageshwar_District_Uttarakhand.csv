bageshwar,"Kausani is all about the view and to a great extent this property nails it. Views from the property are great. On a clear day, you can just sit in the property and let yous eyes feast. Food served at the property is also good. Special word of thanks to Mr Mahesh, the cook at the place. Overall a nice experience.",Pankaj Toppo,/Profile/Toppopankaj,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
bageshwar,"I have been a frequent to this place off late. Staying and working in Noida can be quite stressful, and whenever I need a calm, peaceful, beautiful and a tasty getaway, this is the place. Ajay is an excellent host and his staff is great at service. The views are breathtaking, one can chill and relax for whole day just sitting in the sprawling lawn. Apt for solos, families and children.",Aman Munjal,/Profile/amenmunjal,,50
bageshwar,"We stayed recently for two nights..the location is bit away from the central koushani busstand or Gandhi ashram.. however it has probably one of the best view in entire koushani..it was very old heritage house..we went in off season and no other tourist were there..we had very pleasant and peaceful stay over there without any noise  except they didn't provide us with WiFi also when we ask for bonfire they said will need to pay extra..other than that food prepared by Kailash ji was very tasty and service was excellent..both Kailash ji and Mahesh ji are very nice people who were managing the guest..we strongly recommend the property if u want great view,good food and prefers to live in heritage house..",asiantern,/Profile/asiantern,India,40
bageshwar,"Location: Not very far from central Kausani. View from Hotel was awesome and breath taking. That is the best part of this property. Only for this thing giving 4 rating, otherwise it should get 3.   Rooms and Amenities: very basic, roof is not cemented but of wood, very loud noise of people staying on first floor. We were at Ground floor. Room flooring was getting pressed at some places. Basic beds and furniture. Lobby outside the room and small garden was great. Parking is available just outside the property. Bathrooms are again very basic but clean and hygienic.   Food: food again was very basic. Don’t dare to try Chinese food, that was horrible. Regular Indian meals were ok. Want to thanks their local staff and cook to arrange for a desi Barbeque that was great in taste.  ",894gurpreets,/Profile/894gurpreets,"New Delhi, India",40
bageshwar,"This small property is one of the best in Kausani, why, because of its tranquil atmosphere and caring staff. You can spend your time relaxing and enjoying the nature. The structure though old has been maintained to the best possible. Infact its age is its attraction.",AnupamYPP,/Profile/AnupamYPP,"Kanpur, India",40
bageshwar,The hotel is located away from the city centre and provides a scenic view of the Himalayas. However the weather played spoil sport and I didn't get a single glimpse of the Himalayas. But it still provided a great view of the valley and the rain added to the charm! A economical yet comfortable and honely stay. The food is excellent served to the room or the verandah outside...on a clear weather enjoy your food while looking at the Himalayas. Great hospitality from the staff!!,dey_sushim,/Profile/dey_sushim,"New Delhi, India",50
bageshwar,"The Place is purely Heaven, the people are so good and so friendly, you just feel like home here, and the view is breathtaking, i wish to thank Mr. Mukesh to make finger-licking good food, the non-veg is highly recommended.

bageshwar,"Let me make one thing clear. There is absolutely nothing special about this place other than the Location. They have the BEST spot of land in the area (along with KMVN that's down the road) which gives you a panoramic view of the mountain ranges from Trishul to Panchachuli. It seems like they bought an old house and converted into a Homestay Hotel with ZERO efforts.   The rooms have ZERO privacy. We heard the people in the adjoining OR room downstairs *breathe, snore, talk*. Yes, I really felt that the personn was snowing just 2 feet away from me. The walls are paper thin, and the roofing/flooring of Wood has had no work done on it, so it was absolutely not built for a Hotel. It seems like you are staying in one big room with a bunch of strangers. There is no effort to make the",folkpoet80,/Profile/folkpoet80,"Mountain View, California",20
bageshwar,"This is one place you dont want to miss if you are taking a trip to Uttarakhand. I am a typical city dweller from Mumbai always looking for a new place, a new adventure. Me and my wife were on our annual trip to and decided to take a road trip to Uttrkahand. Afte r hiring a car from Delhi our first stop was Corbett. After the usual disappointment of not seeing tigers we needed to an experience to keep our trip in high spirits and Aashritas was just the perfect place. As we made our ascend to the hotel it was twilight and we could see the Nanda devi peak giving us the final peak.We got up early to see this breathtaking view of the mountains when the sun kisses the peak of each mountain, some sort of a good morning ritual. This was all sitting in a relaxing chair on the balcony. i",Nikhil_Rao81,/Profile/Nikhil_Rao81,"Mumbai, India",50

Very warm and hospitable staff who is ever ready to serve with a smile. Ajay who manages the place is always available to assist and advise on things to do. Ample parking available.

bageshwar,"They say Monsoon season isn’t the time to head towards hills. But somehow, I was always intrigued by the idea of visiting places, during their ‘off season’. Reason why, the idea of Hills in the rains, appealed to me.  So, after hearing horror stories of hours long traffic jams at the popular places, we decided on an ‘off-beat’ place. Also, most of the ‘popular’ places were anyway, covered by us, a few times, in the past.  Kausani it was,for us.  While hunting for a ‘decent’ place to stay at Kausani, we realised that even during off season, most of the places were booked. But guess, we were lucky to come across a place that had a room for us on the preferred dates. Aashritha. We were lucky as the booking for the same room, got cancelled at the last moment.

bageshwar,"Firstly, the mountain and valley view can be seen from all rooms in Aashritha. Secondly, Lalit -the manager ensures that you are catered as per your taste. There are no fans/ AC in the rooms and it gets quite hot in the afternoon. It is pleasant at nights or during winters. Oreo, the pet dog is quite a hit between the visitors.  A few tips:  * Beware of monkeys. Do not eat with the windows open. A monkey managed to take a casserole, open it, and steal rotis. * Feel free to request Lalit for Kumaoni food of madwa roti, matt-ke dhupke and aloo gudka. * The rooms are close to one another and people can easily hear from one room to other. It can be disturbing at times.",Aaditi,/Profile/AaditiJL,Pune,40
bageshwar,Aashrita is a homely B&B setup. It has six rooms of various sizes across three floors. We stayed on the first floor. The rooms open out on a nice big veranda which overlooks the Himalayan range and the Garur Valley. Its a good place to sit and sip tea while just looking at nature at its best. Ajay and team took good care of us. We had Bon fire on the two nights we stated there. The two member staff of Dinesh and Mahesh are A+. They provided good local food served hot in winter and ensured all our needs are taken care of. Ajay also has a adventure sports team but we did not avail of it. They had a cute dog/cat pair that my kid enjoyed playing with.  The rooms are comfortable and the bathrooms are big and clean. They have geysers so hot water is not a problem. All rooms open out,SRGanguly,/Profile/SRGanguly,"Mumbai, India",50
bageshwar,"Kausani is one of the offbeat locations you definitely should visit if you plan Uttaranchal. It offers an unobstructed view of the Himalayan range specially the Trishul and Tully peaks.  There are multiple routes to reach Kausani from plains. I would suggest taking the Haldwani-Almora-Kausani route.  Though it’s longer its less hilly compared to Ramnagar – Ranikhet – Kausani route (we took this route).    Road conditions were ok, all potholes patched and landslides debris cleared (unlike UP roads).  Since it’s not a fully developed hill station, we have very few options for lodging as well as eating out. After a lot of tripadvisor surfing / research we zeroed down on Aashritha.

bageshwar,Love the rustic feel of the heritage cottage. The rooms with real pine wood floors and the furniture to match it. The garden space is where we spent most of our time. The view of the Himalyas from here is jaw dropping. Especially the Trishul peak. The kumaoni themed lunch n dinner was yummy. Enjoyed every bit of it. Ajay Chaudhary and his team made sure that all our needs were taken care of.  Thanks guys for the lovely time. Will c u guys soon.,Pratish R,/Profile/PratishR,"Naukuchiatal, India",50

Very homely environment topped up with delicious food & snacks. Icing on cake is the concept of service with smile and making guest feel like king. You just order and you have it.
