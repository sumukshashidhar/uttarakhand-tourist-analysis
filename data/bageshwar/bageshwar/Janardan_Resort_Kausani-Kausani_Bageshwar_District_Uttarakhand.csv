bageshwar,It is a nasty place to stay at Kausani. In my opinion nobody should book this Resort for staying there. All rooms in the resort are worst to the infinity. It is the bad patch of a heaven like place Kausani. To my experience the Manager of the resort  is a cheater. Be aware of him.,K B,/Profile/KB1130,,10
bageshwar,"we were on a bike ride to kausani on 10/11/12 november. booked two rooms in advance at rs. 700 per room. due to some reasons we reached there in night 10.30. the manager was waiting for us and even he called so many times in between. the food was good, room was good, hot water 24 hours. the staff was really good and the manager Ashish was friendly and too cooperative. stayed two night there and eveything was up to the mark. the view from terrace was amazing. the hotel is 7 km from main kausani chauraha on bageshwar temple road., place worth seeing are baijnath temple, rudradhari fall and temple, gandhi ashram and if you are taking almora route then jageshwar dham is a must must visit. dont forget baal mithai and singora sweet from kheem chand near maal road, almora bus stand.",Ajeetsingh32,/Profile/Ajeetsingh32,"New Delhi, India",40
bageshwar,"I booked the property through airbnb. The host was not present at the location when I arrived. The staff, however, was very nice and guided me to the room. Views are identical to the ones shown in the pictures. Could not catch a glimpse of Himalayas since the weather was too cloudy but spell bounding views nevertheless. The resort is located 7-8 kms away from the main Kausani market. It is on the way to Bageshwar so you might have to pay a little extra to the taxi guy to get to this place.  It's a small hillside motel (can not be called a resort) located on the main Bageshwar road. As shown in the pictures, it's nothing fancy and you get what you pay for. A clean room in a clean and a safe motel. Despite such magnificent views, the moment you look down from the balcony all you",mitul9,/Profile/mitul9,Mumbai,30
