bageshwar,"We stayed at the property for two nights in early June 2015. While the rooms themselves were okay, the staff made all the difference. Nothing was ever a problem with them, no wish was impossible. They went out of their way to make us feel totally at home. The hotel is actually at Bigul, around 15km from Chaukori and around 30km from Bageshwar. If you're looking at a quiet, peaceful break then this is a good enough place to stay. Just make sure that Bhagat is around to help you.",Sandeep K,/Profile/sandeepk240,"New Delhi, India",40

bageshwar,"Bageshwar is a beautiful place to visit. Nanda Devi mountains are filled with natural beauty and Bagnath temple is the great example of historical architecture. During our recent visit to Bageshwar, we had booked 4 nights in this hotel. The hotel rooms were clean and well maintained and the hotel service and hospitality is superb.
