bageshwar,"Just short of Chakouri, Kumaon, this lovely  property set in the woods on the highway between Bageshwar and Munsiyari, is a delight. We arrived unannounced at 5pm off season but the staff was eager and helpful and made us very comfortable.   In the middle of nowhere amongst the woods and with cottages spread across the property it’s  a wonderful place to unwind and camp out for a long stretch and explore the area around. And then there are the views- with the majestic Nanda Devi range looming right up in front with the Trishul and the Panchachuli Range flanking either side the views are to ‘live’ for....   The food is great and the place is really cozy despite the hard rain all night we were warm and dry and then in the morning the rains stopped and the mist cleared and the",ravi3002,/Profile/ravi3002,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40

The manager is an example of how a host should be. The warmth with which we were treated and served was very special. A special mention to the Owner, Mr. Vivek who made our stay even special. The bonfire was a very special experience here. I would go as far to say that this has been the best staying experience of all the numerous holidays that i have been to.

The food and service by Vinod and Rahul was exemplary.   The view of the Himalayan range from Chaukori is stunning.

To the left, just outside the boundary fence there is a small landing from where the Himalayan peaks can be seen. The room was comfortable. You have to ring a bell to call the room service. The food was very good. There were many stone steps from the room to the dining room which were not safe for old people. The whole facility was run by three people, Mr. Ramesh, The Manager, Chhotu, Head of Room Service and House Keeping and the cook.

Secluded from the hustle bustle of the crowd, equipped with bare minimum facilities, this lodge gives the feeling of being close to nature. mobile phone signals are hardly available, only sound that you hear is the chirping of birds everywhere. We choose this place as a pit stop in our journey from haldwani to munsiari but the beauty and peace of the place forces us to stay here in return also.  nice hospitality managed by Mr. Ramesh, the caretaker and his two fellows.

And truly what a treat it was! It has been one of the best and most memorable holidays we have had, as a family.   CGHL is somewhere between a home stay and a hotel. You get the warmth, personalised attention, intimacy of a home with the service standards of a hotel. I found this property through Linger and am grateful to Sameer and the Linger team for facilitating our plans. The owner, Vivek Pandey goes out of his way to make sure you are comfortable.

One can enjoy the most amazing view of the Himalayan range. The peaks of Trishul, Nanda devi , Nanda Kot, Nanda Khaat, and few more are so close that I felt I can touch them.  The Chestnut Grove Himalayan Lodge is best for,-  Walks to the nearby villages. Small treks.  Bird watchers will enjoy, as there are more than 15 to 20 different kinds of birds on the trees around the lodge.  Enjoy Yoga and Meditation, as it is so peaceful. Artist and writers will sure to get inspirations for their creativities. Or just do nothing.. read books and soak in the sun and enjoy bonfire in the night. Thank god, there is no TV in the rooms. Rooms are good,",Ritu C,/Profile/RituC135,,50

The food was homely and u can happily indulge in some of the kumaoni cuisines on request. The manager Mr. Ramesh was especially very welcoming and a great host.

The marketing team sitting in Delhi office helped with all desired queries in advance with a wide list of expectations I should have from the property (this helped me gauge what I am supposed to get). Further as I reached the property late (about 8pm), the manager cum care taker, Ramesh made sure our check in was smooth. The lodges were kept ready with heaters ON in advance since temp was sub 5 degree Celsius outside.  Not to miss, Ramesh was in touch with us a day in advance understanding our food preferences with options he can offer for barbecue. The surprise bonfire was cherry on cake. All in all, I suggest one should visit Chaukori to experience CGHL. Kudos to the team :)",Nikoonz Agarwal,/Profile/nikoonz,"Faridabad, India",50

It is located on the highway and is a perfect stop over for tourists enroute to Chaukori or Munshiyari. It was a peaceful six nights that we spent there. Rooms were very comfortable. You cannot expect a five star like luxury in a place as remote as Vijaypur but they have maintained them as best as the facilities enable them to. More than the urban amenities what the place provides is a rustic charm, a homely feel and an urge to go back again and again. The food is simple, homely and very appealing to the tastebuds.

But when we descended to see the property – in next 5 mnts we were like its ‘AMAZING’ & ‘WONDERFUL’. The property is surrounded mainly by pine trees as well as with some chestnut trees. The property has 2 hutments each having 2 rooms. This is a thematic property and will give you a village’s feeling amid the forest. The rooms are small but you have everything inside.

I would like to mention about Rajender who though being handicapped by one hand could work enough against two staff members with his one golden hand. Kudos to the spirit of this guy. My kid became a huge fan of him and that made this place his favourite one.  The restaurant was nice and the food great. However, the rooms and bathrooms need a lot of maintenance.

If lucky you may get to see some wildlife too....for a bird watcher you will get to see a variety of birds sitting at the Verandah itself. The simplicity of the resort is refreshing. It is made of environmentally friendly materials and is a delight for those who want a small carbon foot print.  Food is simple but flavourful. The staff go an extra mile to fulfill your desires. We were treated to a campfire and barbeque next to our hut.  There are some interesting trails that lead from the resort for those who like hiking.
