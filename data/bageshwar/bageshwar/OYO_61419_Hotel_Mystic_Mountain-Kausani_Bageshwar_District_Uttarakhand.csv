bageshwar,The hotel owner was very cooperative by giving us very beautiful rooms. They made traditional mutton curry for us (we had purchased the mutton on our way to the hotel) and also arranged camp fire on the hotel terrace. The view of the Himalayas was breathtaking from the rooms as well as the terrace. Very close to the tea garden and out of the city noise. ,OsdenF77,/Profile/OsdenF77,"Vasai, India",40
bageshwar,In the midst of beautiful Tea gardens and hills lies the Mystic Mountain Hotel providing some sensational views of the Himalayan Range and the Kausani valley. The hotel is just opposite to Kausani Tea garden and within 5 min driving distance from Gandhi Ashram in kausani. Very well maintained rooms and delicious food arrangements. If you want to enjoy the view to Kausani then I suggest getting in Mystic Mountains because it offers sensational views. I really enjoyed my stay there and wish you would enjoy too.,Dwipayan D,/Profile/DwipayanD5,,50
bageshwar,The hotel was located conveniently and there was no difficulty in finding it. The staff members at the hotel were very good and specialized in service. The appearance of the hotel was good and room allotted was good with all the amenities. There was no delay during check-in and check-out process. The hotel was worth for the money.

bageshwar,A simple hotel with an amazing view. It is not in the main city so one can enjoy the peaceful surroundings. Its next to a tea garden. We just had a glimpse of the Himalaya due to cloud but that few seconds were also awesome.,KaustavSBanerjee,/Profile/KaustavSBanerjee,,40

bageshwar,"the hotel is located on main road which leads from kausani to baijnath, bang opposite to the tourist attraction -tea factory! the surrounding are peaceful except for the tourist shops selling goods to tourist ,which in itself is not much of problem.   on a clear day you can see snow peaks like trishul, nanda ghunti etc from the hotel.  the views are excellent from the rooms, which are otherwise slightly small and open into balcony. the food is good too along with the views from the restaurant. its a budget class hotel offering good value for money, so you would know what to expect.",capri,/Profile/caprijaipur,"Jaipur, India",30
bageshwar,The approach to the rooms is constricted but the rooms are good. The service is also very good and prompt. Food is made to order and is tasty. The best thing about the place is that it is located right next to a tea estate and a small shawl factory. The town is about 6 Km. away The mountains are nicely seen on a clear day.,dr_amitabh,/Profile/dr_amitabh,"New Delhi, India",40

It was a pleasant stay for us.",307bobby,/Profile/307bobby,"Bengaluru, India",50
bageshwar,"Stayed here for a night. If you are of a kind who wants to relax in a quiet place with less crowd, away from city, this is the place to be. I guess they have the best view of the himalayas from their hotel terrace/ balcony. You can see the wonderful sun rays lighten up the great Himalayan range in the morning, a view which I guess is exclusive to Kausani. the whole range gets hidden in the clouds during the day and when we checked in we didn't even know that there were actually snowy peaks hidden behind those clouds!! When we woke up at 6 am the next day, it looked like someone had just placed the full mountain range over the night. You need to see it to experience it.   Moreover, the food is amazing. They don't have landline phones in rooms so you need to call the service boy",Anshul M,/Profile/390anshulm,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",40
