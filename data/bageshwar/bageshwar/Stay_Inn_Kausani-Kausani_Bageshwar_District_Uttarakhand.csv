bageshwar,"Kausani was not part of our original holiday plan. But, we were easily persuaded to change course and our New year's eve found us at the beautiful town of Kausani and the hospitality of Stay Inn Kausani. We have a wonderful view of the mountains right from the balcony. The place has extremely attentive staff, who whipped up hot food on demand right through the new year's eve night, with a big smile on their faces. Very grateful for the same.  Campfires, yummy food through the night and even thoughtfully packed breakfast to carry with us for our long drive back to Delhi, made by a very kind cook at six in the morning on a new year's day...  Even though our halt here was very brief, it set the tone for us for the rest of the year, a wonderful experience of Kumaon hospitality",Srividya Srinivasan,/Profile/SrividyaSrinivasan,"Bengaluru, India",50
bageshwar,"By chance, we reached this beautiful hotel pon 10th November, 2019, which should be categorized among no. 1 hotel, not because of its beautiful view but for the helping staff and manager. There was a booking problem of hotel in Kaushani, and somehow we got this hotel to stay at night. From the very first minute, we came across the helpful nature of the staff. They gave us the top floor rooms, nicely furnished and they came upstairs so many times on every call and with a smile on their faces. The property has a small garden attached full of beautiful roses and malta- a local fruit. they served awesome food (the cook is great, try their alu ke gutke and french fry) and hospitality. Next day morning we could see the Trishul and Nanda Devi range from the terrasse and staff was there",Ranju Chowdhury,/Profile/Trip584137,,50

bageshwar,"My family stayed in Kausani 03 days in this week of May and the trip was made so memorable by the entire team of ""Stay Inn Kausani"" . Right from the time of booking Mr. Bisht, and the owner of the hotel supported my family at every step. He and his crew made our stay absolutely pleasant and comfortable.  The services provided at the resort were excellent. Each and every team member at the resort were so courteous and helpful that for a moment it did not seem to family that they are far away from home. The resort is near to tea garden and very well located. You can see the Himalayas right from hotelâ€™s courtyard. The view of the surrounding hills and trees brought in the calmness and peace which we were looking for. I highly recommend Stay Inn for solo as well as group travelers",Suridner Negi,/Profile/NegiSN,,50
