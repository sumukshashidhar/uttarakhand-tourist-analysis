Best part was they were cooking fresh food whenever you order that's why they take some time to serve. All rooms are designed with different themes and they have something unique about them. Good property! Just would recommend to keep reception number handy in the rooms and mineral water bottle should be provided inside the room.

The decor of the place is very beautiful and eclectic at the same time (do check out the various nick-knacks inside the property). The food served is here is also very delicious.

Shivam (the chef) went out of his way twice to serve us at beyond meal times.  Mohit was helpful, and so was everyone else. The place is a little before Nainital, so go there only for solitude.

The space inside and outside is very well crafted and  Utilised. Amazing original art work all over.  Use of glass in the bunglow makes it look so interactive and keeps the inside warm as it traps the heat from the glorious sunshine it gets.   2. The staff and service.

They arrange for a bonfire/ barbeque if you want (at additional cost; highly recommended).   We did a trek from the hotel to Nanital which was organized by then.

Since it is a boutique kind of place, one should not expect very elaborate arrangements.But that is also the best part of the property, as the staff lets you be and you can enjoy at any of the numerous places to sit and relax at leisure. The service is top notch, especially the man in charge of affaqirs, Mr chandan and Sanjay as well.However, that is also my biggest complaint against the place, which is that some of the staff seems to be made to work for ridicolous hours. These two were at our service from 6 in the morning till midnight.It is almost exploitative, The management needs to correct that.just because they are in need and ready to work long hours should not mean these types of",Nitinnarke,/Profile/Nitinnarke,"Nagpur District, India",50

For us the several sitouts all over the property were the best part. We would love to go back again after the renovation that the property's manager told us about is complete.

Manju, Sapna, Chandan, Radha and the team was the highlight of our stay. Food was excellent. What made eating even more delightful was that it was more of an experience than an activity as the food was usually served by the poolside (surrounded by mountains), around a bonfire or candlelit on a huge dining table.

The property is beautifully restored and reflects the owner's personal taste. First Things is a cosy room with a bed, huge enough to sleep 4! The sleeping loft was the best feature of the room - fully equipped with a bed, a reading lounge and lots of sun throughout the day! The Deck is equally tempting area to catch the sunlight. The hidden corner - Land’s End offers stunning views of the valley with enough seats to sit back and loosen up . The thoughtfully done Ridge Bungalow is one cottage which we have set our sights on for our next stay.

The distance from delhi is not too much and the placement is away from the crazy hussle bussle of nainital.

The food was brilliant- with variety of cuisines. The care takers are polite and give you your space and privacy.  The best part of the place are the small seat outs all over the property be it near the pool or the machan or at the edge of the mountain.

bageshwar,We went to 2 Chimneys with the intent of having a full family reunion after a long time and also celebrate our parents' 45th anniversary. We booked 5 rooms which gave us the advantage of having almost the entire cottage to ourselves. It was a home away from home and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves in that setup.  The cottage is a beautiful old property restored by the owners. Very thoughtfully done - lots of board games for kids which kept them busy and they thoroughly enjoyed themselves without disturbing the adults. Beautiful green playground gave them ample space for running around as well.   Food is home cooked quality and has good variety. Highlight for us was Burmese cuisine and delicious mutton.

The lodge atmosphere is so much better than most hotels with their cookie-cutter rooms and facilities. We loved that each room had its own character and furnishings. Even with other people staying there at the same time, there's enough room to feel like you are staying in your own home.

With no further to go, we decided to head back. With temperature dipping, negotiating our way back was a task. Totally drenched in water with ankle deep snow covering my boots - I had stopped feeling my toes. Nothing crossed my mind but call Manju and ask if she had a room for us to spend that night.  Even though she had given her cook the evening off, she welcomed us and promised to have hot dinner ready for us on arrival.

On Dec 14, while travelling from Sattal to Pangot, we encountered bad weather and snow. It would have been foolish to travel further up to Pangot so we decided to stay back in Nainital. We were travelling in our own vehicle and it was already getting dark. Then my friends remembered 2 Chimneys as they had stayed there before. We tried our chance, called up Manju, who confirmed space was available. So we drove down to Gethia, about 15 kms (apprx 30 mts) from Nainital.

Every room has its own peculiarities and one is better than the other. Its a matter of great difficulty to choose one ;)  Every room offers a great view especially the Oak Suite, First Things and the Nest. To add to the value of the place is the amazing hospitality offered by Manjuji and her entire team.

After day trips to visit the lake towns I could not imagine staying anywhere else, and would have missed out on a truly magical  place.  Being on the grounds at Two Chimneys was above and beyond our best experience in the area on our four-day trip out of the city.   Two Chimneys is soaked in charm. Each room has its own personality. You can sneak away to your own corner and read a book or watch the birds. Feeling like something different? Walk to another area of the grounds and feel like you are in a totally different place!

The resort is located around 20km from Nainital in the quiet hamlet of Gethia. The views from the resort are spectacular (especially from the poolside and the machaan), more so during the monsoon months when everthing is green and white misty fog rolls across the hills. There is also a large garden where children can play games. If it is raining they can sit inside and play the various board games. The resort has a well-stocked library (but it lacks bestsellers and 'quick reads') and a games/TV room (pool. TT, and DTH).
