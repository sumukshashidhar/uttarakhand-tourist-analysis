The advantage is just the view of the valley and the himalaya mountain. The super deluxe rooms are not as shown in their pictures and not worth the money they charge. The property is not maintained. I am simply perplexed regarding their internet ratings on Tripadvisor. They are not charging any less than a star rated hotel like Sterling but its no match to the standards of it. Oyo rooms are better than theirs. Look at the photos I have posted. The food was good though and I again say the staff was too co-operative and more than willing to assist.
