almora,This resort is actually located in Micholi near Ghatti Bhatrojkhan . A serene hill side with full view of the mighty himalayas with clear skies and far from the madding crowd. The resort we stayed was Essence of nature was very cosy and the staff very cooperative. The hill side is full of birds and trekking is a must. A view of khaleez pheasant and red billed blue magpie around is common. The place is situated around 80 km from lalkuan between Ranikhet and Corbett. The weather was fantastic and the 4days of stay was memorable There is an old temple the Ma Bhona devi temple at the top of the hill which can be visited after a short trek. The river Ram Ganga flows silently behind the hill.,manisankarbpl,/Profile/manisankarbpl,"Kolkata, India",30

almora,"1) The service was terrible . Had to call at least 3-4 times for any help . Very casual attitude of the staff  Worst thing is that you cannot call anyone as there is no network    2) The route for last 3-4 KM's was really scary . In fact there was no road only . It was a pain  3) No facilities for senior citizens So I would recommend not to take senior citizens along with your cells as it would be really boring for them and there are so many stairs , so it's difficult  4)Food was Pathetic and expensive too for the quality of food  5)Lastly the attitude of manger was very casual. He did not change your room as we also showed him that they were cockroaches in the bathroom but he didn't agree.  so I would strongly recommend you not to visit I would have seriously 0 star if there",Sunil,/Profile/solotraveller1665,,10

Last 4 KM road to EON is quite risky, it is almost putting family to risk.  3. Price of food  and beverages is way too expensive as per the food quality. 100% monopoly at EON as to get anything we'll have to travel 10Km down on the risky road.  4. In our room we have found the used bed sheet and towels and need to convince staff to change the same. No proper toiletries. Totally unhygienic !!   5.

The only plus point of the resort is its location. The view of valley is amazing. I could not spot Himalayas though , as it was all hazy. This resort is unreasonably expensive in terms of stay and food. they serve decent food at exorbitant rates. I paid like 350+ tax for maggi that i got there. So beware ! There was no mobile network and there was no Wifi at the resort.  Also , the breakfast items are limited unless you come in a group of 20 , they serve buffet then.

Perched at a lofty height of 6000 feet above MSL this resort is just about 7 hours from Delhi (it could take 9 to 11 hours to get to a similar place in Uttarakhand or Himachal) and the best part is the hill drive lasts only for an hour and a half.

almora,"I have travelled extensively in Uttarakhand and Himachal over the last few years, when a friend of mine suggested this place, I agreed to it more as a chance to go to a new place which is in between Jim Corbett and Ranikhet.  However, to my pleasant surprise, when I reached there, I was delighted to see an outstanding property with a blissful surroounding and a clear view of the snow capped peaks of Himalayas from the rooms.  The service was outstanding and the chef and all the staff (Mr. Anil, Mr. Pan Singh, Mr. Manish to name a few) went out of their way to please us.  The food was the best that I had in a very long time.  Overall an outstanding place to go, I intend to return again and again. The place has a temple, trekking options for those who want to.",NampoothiryMahesh,/Profile/NampoothiryMahesh,"New Delhi, India",50

almora,"I stayed there with my wife and two kids for two nights. It was one of the destinations in our Uttarakhand tour. It is a very good property having very beautiful and peaceful surroundings. It has got lot of recreational activities for kids as well as adults. All the staff was very polite and caring. The Manager, Mr Praveen Dalal, was a great host for all staying there. We enjoyed our stay there, would strongly recommend this property to everyone.",amitc11,/Profile/amitc11,"Jaipur, India",50
almora,"The drive to the property is excellent but you have to be in constant touch with the resort staff once you cross Jim Corbett for the direction. The last stretch to the resort of 2-3 km is bit tough in terms of steep road but the resort is making all effort to solve it.  The resort is excellent and the staff and managers are very helpful and cooperative. Food is lip smacking and the chef goes all out to make your stay pleasant. All the rooms are spacious and have clear view of the surrounding nature. Construction is going on to add more rooms. For adventure lovers, there are few offerings such as archery, trekking, picnoc etc. On a clear day you can have the view of Himalayas from your room balcony. Mobile network is fine.  Overall a perfect place to relax and do nothing and just",khapal,/Profile/khapal,"Ghaziabad, India",50
almora,"Amazing, awesome place to stay. If you prefer serenity and quietness, a must visit. Very courteous  and helping staff and nice cozy rooms. Resort manager Mr Praveen gives individual attention to each guest and is fun to talk to.  Mr Pawan Joshi from Delhi team is really helpful. And I must mention the complimentary cake arranged by Mr Joshi on my wedding anniversary ( Thanks !). This shows the attention they pay on finer details. Will definitely visit the place once again and strongly recommend to all who wish to take a break from stressful and busy city lives.",SiddharthGautam,/Profile/SiddharthGautam,"New Delhi, India",50
almora,"An offbeat location where you can spend time for a couple of days in the lap of mountains. The resort is located at a quiet but picturesque place around 1650 meters above sea level. It provides gigantic view of the mountain ranges. The weather changes are dramatic and place is completely rejuvenating. The resort also provides sports facilities like Archery, Badminton, trampoline etc. My kids enjoyed trampoline too much.   The place has around 12 cottages all having good view of the mountains. The rooms are luxurious, clean and nicely done. Food is also good and they were ready to fulfill my kids food demands.  The most amazing part is the service, all the staffs are courteous. They go out of the way to make your stay memorable. Special thanks to Mr Anil Rawat and Mr Joshi for",Anand Prakash,/Profile/callanand,"New Delhi, India",50
almora,Very nice and quiet place and good rooms and pretty nice service. The only thing which is a little negative is that there are lot of flies and cockroaches in the room so something should be done for the same. Apart from that it was a pretty comfortable stay and hospitality was at its best. Food was also very nice and rooms were also pretty neat and clean.,Vinay B,/Profile/travelfreak34,India,40
almora,"A new destination. Nice and quite. Nice cosy rooms, wonderful service, friendly staff, be it house-keeping or waiters or managers. Excellent food. Nice place to relax and enjoy the natural beauty. Total value for money. Though I went with family but this would be a great place to go in a group. The evenings were excellent, some snacks and a drink in their nice garden. One the first day they had lit the bonfire.  I am really very particular about food but here the food was really scrumptious and also a good variety. Would surely like to go again but this time in winters. The little one enjoyed the trampoline. Heard you are coming up with a small play area for kids, Great.

almora,"Spent Two days @ Essence Of Nature (EON).   Lovely property & ambience, courteous staff & managers, outstanding beautiful location, amazing drive & experience and absolute value for money.  Need to take care in the final approach (last 2 Kms) to the resort due to gradient and terrain which the resort is actively addressing and making it comfortable. It would be good to plan to reach there before sunset and be in constant touch with the resort for directions.  Interacted with Mr Praveen Dalal who is setting up the property and with Mr Anil who is managing the same. Absolute treat to have spent the time with them and at their property. Would definitely be heading there soon again soon for ‘DOING NOTHING’ but spend time with self and family.

almora,"The resort is true to its name....Essence of Nature.  The property is small with only about 8 cottages ready when we visited but work was on for an additional 8 rooms. As ours was a fairly large group, we had booked all the cottages and so in effect, the resort transformed into our own private property of sorts and we had an excellent holiday.  Pros: - The resort is located on its own private mountain so there is absolutely no one else around except for you, the staff and nature. There are umpteen nature walks around the property from where you could enjoy the amazing views and unspoilt nature. As there are no other tourists in the area, the surrounding are pristine with no pollution and trash which has become a common sight in almost all the hill stations of India.   - The",agupta02,/Profile/agupta2019,"New Delhi, India",50
almora,"As the name goes, it is truly close to nature, with lush green trees all around. Mountains can be viewed from all rooms. Had lots of indoor activities so did not need to venture out. Food served was good, though menu was not lavish. Since it is a small property, the attention by staff is very good.  Would specially mention, Manish at restaurant, he really did take good care of us. The beds were comfortable and power back up was good. On the whole a very good and enjoyable.  However note, the place is in between of nowhere, so if you a person who loves mall roads at hill stations or wants choice of restaurants every evening, think twice, this just might not be the place for you.",Rajesh L,/Profile/RajeshL943,"New Delhi, India",40
