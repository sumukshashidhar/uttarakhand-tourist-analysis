almora,"We traveled as a couple as stayed there for 3 nights. All the aspects of the property - location, view, Hospitality, food, staff - were impeccable. The only word of caution is the uphill trek of about 15 minutes from the main road, but that is also the reason of a marvellous view of the wide Himalayan range from the property. Once you are in the property, you don't need to go anywhere else. We tried almost all the cuisines and were not disappointed by any single dish.   Mr. Nand Kishore manages the property pretty well and staff is very courteous. Very good property for an off-beat and quiet experience.",raghavs,/Profile/raghav2701,,50

Literally one has to walk 1 KM on hill to reach reception and rooms. your vehicles is 1 km downside parked on public road where no food n water or shop is available for driver. this is worst place i have ever seen in my life. i stayed 1 night and i could not even visit a single tourist destination in ranikhet except golf course and that is one the way to kausani we covered. really not recommended.

Serene and romantic , the resort has a big spread and one should do hikes around it. We hiked to hadiakhan temple & to Khirkhet village .  Food is very good and services is even better. Ask the chef to make kumaoni dishes and you would relish them .Views from Machaan and restaurant area are mesmerizing.

The property is quite peaceful and the staff is also helpful. There are lots of sports activities for the kids and you can easily (or lazily) pass a day or two in the property.

The villas and tents are really well made and the interiors of the same are also very good. Landscaping is also very good. You get a cosy feel in the villa. But lack of TV will disappoint the kids.

The chef is arguably the best I have come across in any 3-star or 5-star properties across India.

But the day we went was relatively hot and the single failed to cool both the rooms of the family villa we booked. For senior citizens they arrange palki for the 600m trek, but still it is difficult reaching the restaurant as the cottages are far apart and steps are involved.in the night our villa was visited by some flying beatles too,  it was pretty scary for me being a bug hater, but they get attracted to lighting and so expected in the setting. I would say it is ideal for couples looking for some peace and quiet. The service was great and overall pleasant stay.",parul,/Profile/bittersweetautumn,,40

Queens Meadows fit into all my criteria beautifully. When I set about to book, Mr. Sanjay Sarin was thoroughly helpful in suggesting rooms for our big group, as well accommodating annoying requests from our side.  We just used email as a communication medium. Mr. Sarin provided so much clarity & comfort on email itself that I never felt a need to pick up the phone and clarify things with him. On the day we started from Delhi, Mr. Sarin kept checking with us every few hours. I guess, then itself, the hospitality that was in store for us, shone through.  We reached at about dusk.

For us, it was ideal place to holiday, although unfortunately we planned only 2 nights there and I wish we had spent at least 3 nights. :(  Stay, food, service all aspects of the hotel were remarkably well. Hotel is located little away from Ranikhet and on a little hill. There is no road up the hill, so, one has to park vehicle below and trek up to reach to the hotel. We reached hotel late around 5 pm in our taxi, still hotel sent their driver and car to ensure, we don't waste anytime in locating the hotel.

Difficult to judge what scores higher- the serenity of nature or the detailing with which the entire structure has been laid - the state of the art tents and villas are luxurious and modern yet have that earthy feeling  which we city goers keep searching.

All the staff are very helpful and at your beck and call serving you anytime whatever you require. Excellent courteousness from one and all.
