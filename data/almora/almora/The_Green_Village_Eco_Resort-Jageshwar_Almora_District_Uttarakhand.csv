almora,We stayed here for 2 nights in mid April 2019. We arrived around sunset and there were dense and thundering clouds towards the eastern skies. A bit of drizzle made the evening super amazing with most exotic views in the east. It was a wonderful experience overall. The property is easy to access and is exactly on the main Almora-Pithoragarh highway (not so busy). The staff is super excellent.The staff was constantly in touch with us on the day of our arrival confirming our location and whereabouts. The best thing about this hotel is that it is well built with separate cottage type units. One cottage block can have up to 4 rooms for 8-10 guests. Some units are even bigger. So a big family can have an entire unit to themselves. Another good about this hotel is that the property is,Skak,/Profile/SunilK2236,"New Delhi, India",50

Each room is constructed with the idea of luxury and comfort with best views and ambience. The property is located on a hill slope and guests can enjoy birdwatching, small hikes and many other activities in the area. Many temples like Jageshwar, Vriddh Jageshwar, Jhakarsem Temple etc are easily accessible and very close to the resort. The staff is very courteous and food is delicious.

I visited them in march and the heating in the rooms was very good, there comfortable rooms also have big windows offering a good view outside. the food was very good as well.

To us it did since there was someone else next door who kept taking a stroll in the night. The windows have transparent glass so we couldn't keep the curtains off even a single moment. Other than this everything else seemed fine. The bathroom geyser  went off due to some failure but I don't blame it on to the resort. That can happen anywhere and is no fault of the hotel. It worked fine until early morning and in the other rooms we had booked.  Food was delicious. No item I can complain was not good. Service is good. In all nice and comfortable place to stay.
