almora,"I reached in the evening at around 5pm and found difficulty to find the property bcoz there was no sign board on the road. The caretaker arrived in 5 mins and took us to the property.  But once we reached the place we forgot about the initial difficulty faced to find the property. The house is very well located and maintained. You have a clear view of the snow covered peaks from balcony, terrace and lawn. Rooms are spacious, airy, well furnished and maintained.  We were very well hosted by the caretaker. He took good care of us. Food prepared by him was finger licking good.   Undoubtedly the best property in the area. I strongly recommend it.",Ashish Singh,/Profile/Singhashish2892,,40
almora,"Very welcoming hosts, helpful caretaker and the majestic view of the himalayan range from the room, made our hearts smile with joy. This place connects to multiple forest trails. You can go for a quick hike , crossing various pine trees and the fallen cone and small mountain ranges. It's away from the city lights and noise but very calming and peaceful.",Archana Kar,/Profile/Archenemy27,,50
almora,The villa has a great view of the himalayas. But a special shout to Manisha and Rajnish who were the perfect host and made our stay really special. The hike up the apple orchard was special and the food and room were homely. A bigger sign board on the main road will be helpful for travellers to locate the hotel.,Saurabh B,/Profile/Saurabh_reeja,"Singapore, Singapore",50
almora,it was a memorable experience for me and my family . They really enjoyed the view and comfort of your Villa. Your staff was very courteous and very diciplined.  Thanks for the hospitality. One of the best views of Himalayas can be viewed from here.,Tejas Mehta,/Profile/TejasM61,,50
almora,"Thanks a lot first of all to the cosmos team for their overwhelming hospitality. It was a wonderful experience especially for accommodating our family (including our pet).  I will recommend this place anytime for families, writers, backpackers and groups who love serenity and peace and will like to find themselves under the mesmerizing view of the Nanda Devi Himalyan Range.   A great place, very well built from the lush green entrance to the porch, while you can view plums hanging around you.We really enjoyed the entire Villa, especially the way its interiors are well thought through. Enriched with the presence of classical wooden interiors, stone walls, a marvelous fireplace, frosted glass, porch and ambiance lighting.  Best time to visit is either in monsoons or in winters",Deeptesh B,/Profile/deepteshb,,50
almora,"Amazing view from every corner of the house, tastefully done up wooden interiors, a cottage I didnt feel I was coming to for the first time. Naveen uncle the caretaker took care of all our needs and I found the place at a very central location, from where locations such as Bubudham Tepmple, Kalika Temple on one one side and the local town of Majkhali on the other side were easily accessible. When you find personalised luxury and scenic beauty all at one place. you know thats home away from home.",Bhuvan R,/Profile/BhuvanR18,,50
almora,It was a family trip and stay at the Cosmos Himalayan made it memorable for us.  Himalaya's peaks are clearly visible. Orchard in the property make it a real fun for kids. Food is awesome and is prepared as per your taste and preferences. It was all together an excellent stay.,Rahul R,/Profile/rahulr994,,50
almora,"All the features, and detailed provided by the cottage's owner is fake and false. There was no room service, no Television in room, no electric kettle and the worst of all no one to address your issues. Manisha stays in Delhi and only collects money that too all in advance. No bill provided for the payments of cottage room, and food was pathetic as well as overly priced. Small rooms and very expensive doesn't even include breakfast (Rs. 4500/day for the room). Absolute waste of money... worst experience I ever had.",Deep C,/Profile/572deepc,"Noida, India",10
almora,We stayed in this property for 3 nights. We were two families. This villa has four rooms and we were the only guests here. So the entire place was available to us. My kids enjoyed the most. The garden is well maintained. If you are expecting some sort of hotel or resort  then strike this place out. This is meant for people who are looking for a beautiful holiday villa at a peaceful hilly location. The caretaker is a nice person. We didn't face any trouble during our stay. He willingly accommodated all our sundry requests. We chose the wrong month to visit. Hence missed the Himalayas views. Locals say one should plan to visit Ranikhet during December - January to have clear view of Himalayas peaks. We will definitely come back to this place. ,Kunja Joshi,/Profile/kunjajoshi,"Noida, India",50
almora,"This property is wrongly listed on Makemytrip as a Villa, no water, no fan, no Restaurant, all the facilities mentioned are FAKE. You might get died of hunger as there is nothing to eat. The property is just managed by a caretaker who is helpless, they will not serve you any food, neither will allow to bring anything from outside. The owners are very rude and always look for making money from the guests, they will force to eat the food prepared by the caretaker which is super expensive. You will not be able to find this place even with the help of Google.",ranjan464,/Profile/ranjan464,"New Delhi, India",10
almora,"Its around 3.5 kms from golf course, nicely constructed property which is beautiful, location is good  but could ve enjoyed more if smokey pattern would ve subsidized, parking available, caretaker was a nice man, you need to order early so that fresh supplies can be procured. No fan, extra plug points for charging were not available in the room. Its a place where you won't find luxury but if you want to relax from daily hustle bustle of city life, then you may go for it.",tuhin2001,/Profile/tuhin2001,"New Delhi, India",40

almora,"My family loved the place. Well maintained property, with a breath taking view from the room.  It gives a very homely feeling. Care taker cooks delicious food. You should visit the museum & shawl factory. Avoid going on a Sunday to the museum as it is closed. ",Storyteller693413,/Profile/Storyteller693413,,40
almora,"Nestled away from the hustle bustle of Ranikhet, this boutique bunglow must have been constructed as a private home with 4 well appointed bed rooms, living, dining and kitchen..all with exquisite furniture. The front courtyard and the exclusive approach to it adds character to the property. The cook and caretaker provide food as required. The best past is that all rooms open up to the great Himalayan range consisting of Nandaghunti, Trishul, Mrigathuni, Nandadevi, Panchauli peaks standing right in front of you. It is a home away from home..your own as along as you stay. A little pricey, but such comfort doesn't come cheap. ",Subrahmanyam R,/Profile/subrahmanyamr2014,,50
almora,It is a good bungalow. you can stay  very peacefully with you family. But  their own  kitchen  should be more updated with different  foods. I very much like the same. It is a very  high stranded . They are not having any direct telephone line. It may good or bad. Nobody will disturbed you .,Sabyasachi Bhattacharya,/Profile/sabya111,"Kolkata, India",40
almora,"I was a trip to Ranikhet via Nainital from New Delhi with my family by car on 2nd October 2015. Road trip wonderful except some minor problem near Bazpur. Otherwise the whole road condition was very good. I have booked a room at Cosmos Himalayan Villas. I feel very happy when I have reached the property. I just have only one word ""WOW"". It was so wonderful , full view of NandaDevi Mountain range. The place was so quite it reminds me my home town. Whether was too good. Next day I took a drive to Kausani though a unnamed road.It become a adventure drive. in some place road was not there, we have to find road and move ahead through some narrow hill road.

almora,"I opt for this hotel by seeing some good reviews. My overall experience is nice.   Good things: A very good property with royal touch Good sights from room Food taste is good Very less pollution  Bad things: Expensive Food Very old man is cooking and carrying luggage. Driver room not available, need some separate room on your pocket to book another room for driver. My tata photon signals were not comings, so missed some of important office work. If you small kids, you opt it. The property has very expensive decorative material easily approachable to kids. It was hard for kids to stop.

almora,"I was on a trip to Nainital/Almora/Ranikhet/Kausani in June 2015. The trip was arranged by a tour operator and they provided me a few hotel options in each of the places. I picked Cosmos in Ranikhet.  This was the best accommodation I had in the whole trip. Cosmos is not actually a Hotel, theyâ€™ve a couple of cottages in different places in and around Ranikhet. We stayed in a cottage in Majkhali, a small village some 10 odd kilometres away from Ranikhet.  To begin with, it was situated in a beautiful place, away from the hustle and bustle of the city life. The cottage was a duplex with 3 double bedrooms, one hall, kitchen and attached baths. The whole set up was tastefully decorated, well furnished and very well maintained.

almora,"Hi, I have visited Cosmos Himalayan Villas in 19th & 20th June 2015 with family. I have taken 2 cottages & paid 9000/- per day for both the cottages. Location of cottages are good but lots of mosquitoes, spiders were there. No jet was installed inside toilets.I have asked to caretaker for installing jet but he did not even contact me for the same. Owner was simply interested to take remaining amount from me. Road from mall road to reach the cottages is not good. You can not find out cottages easily. After paying this much of amount owner of the cottages simply denied for complimentary bed tea also.   Food is good. Cook is good. Whatever you want to eat he will cook for you.",Manik G,/Profile/ManikGupta190178,"New Delhi, India",20
almora,"I visited this property in August 2014. The Villa is very nice and the property is good and well maintained. The location is nice if someone need the view of mountains otherwise it is far from the main market. The connecting road from the hotel to main road is not nice.  If anyone wants to visit here then they will come in group otherwise they will get bored easily as there is nothing much to do in this place as well as in Ranikhet. Main problems is the food. There is a cook who will be Available at it service. You must have to tell him that what to cook. He does not cook the non-veg items well, so better to order veg only. There are few restaurants near bus stand/ main market but they are very far from this place and no one will provide you home delivery option.

almora,"Cosmos Open view Estate, Ranikhet is different from Cosmos Himalayan Villas. Although we were told earlier that both are one and the same. Open view estate has total 3 independent cottages. We stayed in a 3 bedroom cottage which was quiet good. Scenic beauty from all the 3 rooms of the cottage was good. Rooms were decently furnished and there was sufficient space. Location was not easy and we had to take assistance from the hotel staff to reach there. Service at the hotel was average as there were only 2 staff to look after and serve all 3 cottages. They had to look after the house keeping and cooking for the 3 cottages. We had to order our requirements at-least 3 hrs. before. Even snacks were also not available on demand.

almora,"We stayed at the Majkhali property in a delightful stone and wood cottage (the sort one reads about in books), surrounded by the lush greenery of the tastefully landscaped grounds.  The property was a huge hit with everyone in the family.  The husband was happy with the presence of cable tv.  The children loved the freedom to wander about the property and explore the grounds.  The numerous reading corners ensured that everyone had a cosy nook to themselves.  The presence of a verandah and a garden gave one different options to enjoy the outdoors.  The cottage was tastefully done up with comfortable furniture.  It was well maintained and one did not want for anything.

On clear days the view of the Kumaon Himalayas from the  cottage is mesmerizing. The staff at  the cottage go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and pamper you.
