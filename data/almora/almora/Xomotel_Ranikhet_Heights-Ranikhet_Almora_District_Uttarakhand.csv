The village Chiliyanaula, where its located, is calm and serene and offers grand view of Himalayas. Their service, their hospitality cannot be matched even by some of the top hotels. Food tastes delicious and just like home made. So impressed by their service and the location, we ended up extending our stay. This village and this hotel has my heart.

almora,"Hi.  I booked this hotel from a popular online agent for two nights (13 & 14 June 2019). My online agent site says it’s a 3 star hotel but I call it a ZERO Star hotel. On demanding for a govt proof of 3 star hotel the staff was unable to show it.  First of all the Deluxe rooms are pathetic. Never ever book these rooms for even Rs.100 a night. Deluxe rooms are non liveable.  I asked the manager to upgrade us to a Suite but he asked me to pay Rs.1,500 per night extra. This is their modus operandi to extract money from all the tourists who come here for a stay. Even after paying Rs.1,500 per night extra the room was not upto the mark. The linen was dirty, the room had a sewage smell and the bathroom was not maintained.   I visited their games room, library and jim but it was",paragkohli,/Profile/paragkohli,"New Delhi, India",10

almora,"Very well located on top of a hill, hence, paradise for nature lovers with a number of pagdandis (0.5 hr - 1hr) starting from the resort for a nice nature walk. Additionally, since it is 6 km away from Ranikhet (in Chiliyanaula), it is idol for people wanting a break from city madness and noise.  Though, I wanted to stay in the cottage, I managed to get only the deluxe room as the resort was fully booked due to long weekend. The rooms need to be better maintained (mattresses not comfortable, beds in a slightly broken state, paint peeling off, etc).  The food was average, definitely not great. Also, they prefer to serve only buffet and hence, there is limited option available from the menu.",Divyabh B,/Profile/divyabhb,New Delhi,40
almora,A very decent resort and best part is the peace you get at this location.  There is nothing much to do around there however if you want to relax your mind then nothing like this place.  I went there with my parents and family and they all thoroughly enjoyed the stay there. You can actually here the sound of the wind blowing through the pine trees.  The best part is the road leading up to the Resort which is scary at first but enjoyable.   Staff is great and food is good as well. Not a bad pick at all,Vinayak S,/Profile/211vinayaks,,40
almora,I stayed at Aman's Anabella for 3 days 2 nights with my parents in June end. The first thing that struck me was the sheer beauty of the place. The cottages are in the lap of nature. The rooms were in excellent condition & the staff was super sweet & helpful. I would specially mention Vijay (Chef) for the most amazing food and Vikas & Narendra for making our stay so comfortable and looking after our every need. This has been one of my best experiences in any resort. Thumbs Up to you guys. We would love to be back here over & over again...,NoopurV,/Profile/NoopurV,"Jaipur, India",50
almora,"The Resort is located  to the North of Ranikhet. It nestles among the tall Pine trees standing as silent sentinels on the pristine slopes of the Kumaon hills. The resort in fact has no road leading upto it’s porch and, unless one calls for  transhipment at the road head or is willing to do some off-roading through the Pine forest, you have to go up a long flight of steps from the parking area. This handicap apart, the Resort is beautifully situated and being next to the Haidakhan Babaji Temple provides an opportunity to exponentially enhance one’s spiritual experience by attending the morning and evening prayer meets.  The Resort has a row of rooms (Suite Rooms) which are constructed on a very lavish scale with a front sitout, a sitting room, a large bedroom and a big bathroom.",Surinder Sharma,/Profile/surinders713,"New Delhi, India",40

almora,"I had visited this place with my family in the month of May and we had an amazing time. Having booked 2 deluxe rooms, I quickly decided to update to suites knowing that they were vacant. In spite of the price difference, the suites were definitely worth it. The porch in front of each suite overlooking a beautiful garden and offering more than a decent chance of catching a glimpse of the Himalayan peaks does tempt you. We were really lucky to get a peak on a summer morning but winters would definitely be your best bet. Food at this hotel, though all vegetarian, was extremely good and hygienic. A special mention goes to the staff at this hotel who are extremely courteous and are willing to help you out in every possible manner.

It is located on a small hilltop from where you can see Himalayas nicely. The rooms are really spacious and have placed sofa-cum double bed in the first smaller room for kids.  Food served was really good. On the back, there is dense plantation where you can go for a stroll. Nearby temple of ""Baba Haidakhan""is famous and is really worth a visit for its scenic beauty and peaceful environs. There is a play room and library too in the hotel.

There was no fountain in the toilet and the whole room was infected with all kinds of mosquitoes and other small creatures. The toilet floor had white tiles with yellow patches on it. I had to look into 3 rooms before choosing the one in which I stayed. Not a place to visit in rainy season. The hotel staff was not dressed and they were not at all professional, although soft spoken. The hotel staff was almost helpless.  The rooms are large and decent and place has forest behind it. It's a small property having only 11 rooms so you won't get to see professionalism in management.
