almora,"It's a lovely property one can find to chill with friends or simply to enjoy nature. But the property is not at all well-maintained with average services. Blankets and linen are super dirty with hair and stains. In the name of sports, only a dilapidated billiards table, that too on request. Imagine they offer no tandoor food items. Even the smallest of restaurant has paneer Tikka and naan and we were were told both days 'mam neeche se koyla Lana padta hai, 10 logon me Kya  laayein' so no tandoor. King room costs you 5k inclusive of breakfast and taxes (we were horrified to hear they charge 9k in peak season) whereas, queen cottage is for 4k. King room is huge and stylised so paying 5k for it didn't pinch. But queen room was small and average and it shouldn't ideally cost more",Preetika G,/Profile/preetikag12019,,30
almora,"The resort is lovely, overlooking Almora town and the valley. Mornings are especially beautiful. A 5 min walk outside the resort up the road opens up to a spectacular view of the Himalayas. You don't get the view of the Himalayas from the rooms or resort. There's also a lovely pine forest (very hike friendly) that surrounds this property. The rooms are comfortable and spacious, but require one round of maintenance. A few floor panels are broken here and there. One needs to climb down a set of steps to reach most rooms. Food is good but the restaurant is not heated. Overall, a lovely stay.",archana_mrao,/Profile/archana_mrao,"Bengaluru, India",40
almora,Stayed at Imperial Heights with family and thoroughly enjoyed the time spent at the property. The layout is great and the views are beautiful of the valley and the nature. The staff was super courteous and supportive esp. the room service despite of a festival weekend. The food is yummy and homely types. We opted for a kings room which was huge and well equipped but the trail to the room is bit uneven esp. for those with walking disability or elderly. The room has a living area and little elevated bathroom and dressing area. Wifi is available in the restaurant and reception area.,Sunayana W,/Profile/Sunayana_Walia,"New Delhi, India",50

Kasardevi trail starts only steps from the property. Quiet and peaceful, away from the bustle of Almora city. Beautiful and well maintained landscaping. The dining area has pine interior and open beams and trusses and large glass windows that bring the entire valley indoors- probably the best room on the property. The small staff, particularly Gopal, was very helpful and the breakfast generous and made to order. The room-maintenance appears to be an afterthought. Our bathroom lacked toilet paper and had no holder for it. The bidet hose did not work due to broken knob. The run-off from the shower made a mess. Even a wiper",pandec537,/Profile/pandec537,"New Canaan, Connecticut",30

Each room is good for 4 people, with space to spare. They're on a hill, so the views are good for each room. The standard rooms also have good views.

After visiting this resort I really think the reviews are fake and posted by the resort owner and his family under fake ids!

Food - It was excellent (Veg and Non Veg) special compliments to the Chef.  The staff was helpful & courteous.",GauravRohatgi,/Profile/CA_GauravRohatgi,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50

almora,"Imperial heights sounds regal but actually, it's just a clean and neat place with decent facilities. The rooms were adequate but having a good view. We had taken rooms 101 & 102 which had a comon balcony overlooking the valley. One needs to be careful here when travelling with kids as the railing is low enough for a 3 year old to climb and fall down. The staff were not courteous, as we found 2 staff grumbling about how they have to do work that is not in their original profile. The food was ok, but fresh. The cook, Goswami, is helpful and can cook up anything you want. it's the service staff who were not trained at all. All in all, a good reasonable place to stay, if you are going to remain outdoors during the day.",anandiyer,/Profile/anandiyer,"Mumbai, India",30
almora,This is a very good property blessed with an amazing location. We chose the Valley Facing Rooms at the first floor. We had taken two adjacent rooms which had a common balcony. The View is breathtaking One can actually sit hours together gazing at the changing faces of the nature. The room is decently maintained.  You have very basic amenities like hot water in the tap. (where some resorts actually bring buckets of water into your room) Room has Tv but TATA SKY not re charged. room service is decent.The food in this hotel is pretty good. We were travelling with kids for which the chef(Mr.GOSWAMI) readily helped us with khichidi. They serve very good tea as well. Lunch is actually made on request.So if u need anything specific you will have to tell the chef well in advance. I,sneha_vish,/Profile/sneha_vish,Mumbai,30

almora,Date 23June 2008  We were five families but had booked the rooms for four families. When We reached there they did not have the extra room rather they had only four rooms and out of that one was still not vacant. We were all shattered as the man who booked for us told a lie. The resort was under construction then. The main thing that they booked by telling a lie. However next day we got the 4th room as well and they adjusted the 5th Family in the nearby hotel.  The one good thing was that all the 4 rooms had good sizes and have a wonderful valley view. We were unlucky all those days the valley was engulfed with dry clouds and it was too hot. People say that from there you can see Nanda Devi peak as well. Overall our stay went well as the Kitchen staff was courteous as we were,KamalKiMasti,/Profile/KamalKiMasti,"Noida, India",20
almora,"Although the property is new and very serenly located, yet the service is very very poor and the people very cold and non helpful. The toilets are very basic and often the taps go dry as you are standing in the middle of your shower. Also the geyser just stops working and the hot water supply stops. The rooms are spacious but ill kept. Basic hygiene factor in the rooms is missing. When pointing this out to the manager, we were made to understand that we do not know how difficult it is to maintain a property in the hills. There are better places than this in the same area for any body to stay.",Traveller_451,/Profile/Traveller_451,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",10

The resort is beautiful, with a greenery in plenty, helpful staff, decent restaurant, a beautiful scenarist view and much more.

almora,"It was pleasant experience in Imperial Heights  resort during our  stay of 2 nights. We arrived late at around 10:45 pm, due to some problem in my vehicle, we were greeted and they served us fresh prepared hot  food though it was bit late at night.   The staff are helpful and the best part of resort I think is its location and the restaurant which is something unique especially the idol of lord Natraj which is truly a masterpiece. The view you get of Almora town at night gives a great feeling.  The room are cozy though  somewhat small in size for us (03 adults)",Abhinandan099,/Profile/Abhinandan099,"Noida, India",50
almora,"We stayed here for a night on the way to Binsar Sanctuary as it became too late and there was no accommodation available at Almora due to Dussehra. It was an average stay here. The room we got was facing the valley and in the morning, it was completely covered with fog. It was a beautiful sight to see the fog lifting when the sun came out.  Pros: Very nice location. Very spacious room with excellent hot water & water pressure.  Cons: Bad service. When we reached at night, we ordered a simple veg dinner which was served after 1.5 hours!!! Next day, when we ordered breakfast, it too took over an hour. Bad food.",nips_manny,/Profile/nips_manny,Mumbai,30
almora,"During my stay at Imperial heights I felt comfortable, the hotel was very tidy and its room and bathroom were clean. The good part is the hotel has very large space inside the hotel – perhaps the largest area I found in all hill hotels I visited. There is a beautiful deck from where you can enjoy sunsets at its best in cool monsoon evenings. The location of Valley Facing rooms are more good compared to Imperial Rooms as you can have complete view of valley right in front of you from your balcony. They also have arrange pickup from us from Kathgodam railway station ofcourse after paying Rs 1000 for it but the driver was very good and patient Rest all other things were up to mark especially the restaurant which surely is a unique one and has got some fine works of antiques placed",Daksh84,/Profile/Daksh84,"Chandigarh, India",50
almora,". this hotel is not in binsar,its 7km from Almora and  14km before binsar gate. 2. Imperial rooms are under construction so no proper facility like hotel room and cottage is available in this hotel. 3. food quality like road side restaurant.. quality is horrable. 4. Hotel decide the menu for serving to guest... guest can not decide their food even in ala carate 5. best part of hotel, open platform where you can enjoy naturs,s beauty. 6.

It was a 1.30 hrs  drive from Nainital, peaecfull as roads are in excellent conditions well worth it. The place is overwhelmingly beautiful and i think the resort is most ideally located - the first time you enter. The service needs uplift as waiters are slow than usual. And rest everything is great. The high point is the view of the almora town at night and of Binsar Valley. Food is great and too, though serving can take bit longer than you expect",KAMINIGUPTA,/Profile/KAMINIGUPTA,DELHI,50

The options for breakfast were excellent but somehow the quality of the food was lacking.  The restaurant was good, but I had problems getting prompt services. When I phoned housekeeping I was told that someone would come immediately.

The Deluxe rooms are under complete upgradation so unable to stay in the heritage block where these rooms are situated. Rooms are also on the first floor, and I would recommend staying in these rooms as they offer great views of Binsar valley right from your hotel balcony.   The hotel is away from the town centre. Binsar Sanctury though easily accessible from here but roads are not in good shape.Visitng to Jageshwar temple from here requires a taxi ride and    liked the hotel. It delivered on most counts.
