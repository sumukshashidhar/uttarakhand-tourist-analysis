There is no Television in the rooms, you will find little to no connectivity on your mobile networks and the Wifi is limited to the reception area - which is great for people who really want to disconnect from the world.   I completed reading a book that was pending for some time, slept on the hammock under the sun and played badminton (they have a court in the campus and also provide the rackets and shuttlecock)   The staff is friendly, humble and very caring.

Property is very old (and well maintained) and has a fantastic history being the private property of Sir Henry Ramsay the British commissioner of Kumaon.  We were lucky to meet the owner of the property Mr Himanshu and hear the history first hand from him - including the anecdote of how the estate got its name (Khali - denotes empty in Hindi).  Gandhiji, Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi were some of the big names who had stayed here.  But the owners are modest and dont advertise that fact.

We found it an absolutely gorgeous place and loved every minute of being there. The rooms have views of the Himalayas (from the bed!), the staff are kind and helpful, and the food is AMAZING! Just gorgeous meals, both breakfast, lunch and dinner. There are also other treats such as hot water bottles at night and tea in your room in the morning. Khali is also in a stunning setting and you will enjoy breath-taking vistas, and all sorts of flora and fauna (including an occasional monkey!). There’s not much to do but take gentle walks and read your book (which you may borrow from the extensive library collection at the estate) and just enjoy being",bel1979,/Profile/bel1979,England,50
