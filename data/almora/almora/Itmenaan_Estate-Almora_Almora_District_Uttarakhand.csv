almora,"Arrived in the pouring rain and cold and the walk to the house was not easy.  However, once we arrived in our room we were greeted with a hot drink and a portable charcoal fire and some calm returned to the world.  The room was lovely, and the new looking bathrooms were a pleasant surprise. The staff are really lovely and couldn't do enough to help, and the hot water bottles to warm up the bed were a real treat. Eating in the large communal room was entertaining, again accompanied by a burning ember fire . The staff are from the local village, and whilst they may not be professionals, they have a great attitude and could not try any harder to please. It was quite cold in the main house, and in general, the old brick built rooms can be chilly. The location is stunning with views",Chris S,/Profile/Y2664QVchriss,"Zurich, Switzerland",40

Our stay at Itmenaan was like stepping into a fairy tale, pretty stone cottages with red windows opening up to snow clad mountains. The estate can be reached after a good 15 to 20 min hike downhill, again the time taken also depends upon ones fitness level and make sure you are wearing the right footwear to get you through this one. I wouldn't recommend this for senior citizens though as it could take a toll on their knees specially the trek back from the cottage to the parking area.

The approach road's a bit discouraging...but once there, u won't repent... Located in the middle of no where... Peaceful... Humans r The last thing in sight... Rooms and washrooms r basic... But fun to put up in... Specially the washroom experience is great! The open air dining is again worth mentioning! A huge stone top table on logs, lush green mountains... No onlookers as delicious food is served... The staff's super warm and helpful... Nothing much to do here as such, but still a great place to spend a day or two in nature and peace...

You want to make it adventurous or want to Itmenaan, completely your call.  In our hectic lives in Delhi, this was the best vacation one could ask for in the scorching summer with nature's airconditioner all around. The credit goes to the friendly and caring staff of ITMENAN for making this one of our memorable trips. From Shweta (Itmenaan Representative in Delhi) to Kailash (our Driver) to Naveen and team (Staff at Itmenaan), and last but not the least “The Naturalist Avijeet”, everyone ensured we had great time there.

The place is beautifully located. The staff courteous and always ready to help. Food is delicious, as per your choice and what makes it an even more pleasant experience is sitting and eating your meal amidst mustard plantations and lemon trees. Being an avid photographer, the photography walks were a great experience. Being in Delhi, most of your time gets spent just in travelling and in your office, not leaving much time to pursue other hobbies. It felt great to reconnect with my camera during these walks and having a naturalist by your side was a great help. Overall a great stay.

almora,"It was certainly a good experience to stay at Itmenaan Estate. The best part was location & ambiance. At least I loved to trek down to the Estate from main road. The food was also good, mainly the breakfast & coffee.  Of course naturalist Avijit was brilliant at his job & friendly. He made the morning/evening walks more enjoyable. Secondly the staffs at the lodge took very good care of us. I am pleased with their service too.       Few odds like.. it is not possible for a old person to climb down as in I may never take my parents in such place so you guys can invest little more to make stony steps down to the estate from main road.

Chirping birds, pahadi bhotiya dogs, distant calls of farmers ploughing their fields form an orchestra with the rustling of pine trees reminiscent of the sea.  4 course meals and the most wonderful staff, rustic warm rooms, plush beds and a stunning bathroom with a skylight !   Pros- 1. Yummy food and presentation (carry your own booze and try our concoction of Vodka with cold rhodendron juice and definitely ask the Chef for Banoffee for dessert) 2.

The wildlife and bird life of the Western Himalaya is not so well known but a weekend at Itmenaan will easily turn you into an enthusiast! Instead of lazing around, I took to the hills. Barking deer, ghoral, martins, squirrels, languar, jackel, leopards are to be found in the area and an early morning nature walk turned up more than 13 varieties of bird life. The beds are the softest I have slept in for a long time, staff are more than pleasant and the food is exceptional. Faultless, elegant simplicity.

The staff is excellent and they really take care and know their stuff. Food was good, and was adapted to our needs as we requested simple home made Indian food. On the fifth year of our marriage we wanted to remarry as per the Hindu customs. Itmenan staff went out of the way to arrange the marriage ceremony. Because of that we could prepare and plan everything in advance. All the necessary stuff was bought in advance by Itmenan and we were even helped in getting the priest ( Pujariji) to get the marriage done at Jageshwar temple.

almora,Plus side : fantastic views. Solitude. Physical good walks. Very clean. Good water supply. Food/Meals provided. Very Good staff. Though need to find a way of attracting staff attention better as in a separate building. Great getaway location Negatives: no vehicle access so strenuous walk from road down steep incline for 30 mins to lodge. No electricity during the day. No Internet.   Currently there are 3 joined accommodations in a single building. Which was fine as we were only ones there. However if others occupied you would feel on top of each other and would not have the solitude of this location. The owner is currently building other separate lodges. No television so would only appeal to some families.,FullTime_traveller9,/Profile/FullTime_traveller9,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",40

It is very rare that you travel for more than 12 hrs on road then walk a kilometer on rough terrain to reach your destination and not feel tired. The adventure with itmenaan starts the moment you park your car near the local market and start walking towards the hotel. If you have childlike curiosity and even a little streak of adventure you will love this place.   It’s a beautiful property amidst orchards of apple, lemon, sweet lime, pomegranate etc. The place was beaming with colors as flowers were in full bloom when we visited.
