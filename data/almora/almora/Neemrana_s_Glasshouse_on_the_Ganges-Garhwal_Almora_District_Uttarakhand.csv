I was not convinced that a holiday by a river -- and a small one at that, given that the Ganges is only about 20 metres wide in the Himalayan foothills -- would have that much to offer.  And the online photos had done little to hook me, as the Glasshouse didn't seem to have the historical charm of Neemrana's signature hotels,  But this ended up being one of the best holidays I have ever taken.  Although the road to the Glasshouse is a challenging one -- it is currently facing two years of reconstruction, and its already precarious winding hairpin bends are even more precarious as a result -- the destination makes it all worthwhile.

Booking.com mentioned 10 % + 7.5% but we were charged multiple other taxes.  We missed our train from haridwar. Apparently high traffic at haridwar is a regular thing on Sunday and it takes 3 hrs to get there instead of regular 1.5 hrs. The property didn't even think it was important to inform the guest.

Entire property can be segregated on either side of main block.. Cottages-2 which is new provides good view of Ganges.. while the cottage-1 room's view of river is blocked by Trees...

One can go for an early morning walk on other side of river to a village on the mountain and that will be a wonderful experience..

Property feel is nice but at 10K a night, simply not worth it. Room was pretty boring (stayed at Narmada), with a balcony and trees obstructing the river view, lighting was not ample inside and toilet flush doesn't work properly. Food is really bad and they need to improve it big time. We ordered tea in the evening and it smelled of rotten milk and returned. The waiter did't even cared to reorder it, probably they ran out of milk. Dinner was buffet and was equally bad, there was a weird smell from the gravy.

This is the third Neemrana property I have visited and it did not disappoint.   Firstly, the access. The most convenient way to reach is to fly into Dehradun and take a taxi (we had asked the hotel to send us one). It takes about 1.5 hour to reach the Glasshouse and costs about Rs.2300 for a smaller car. Rishikesh town is around 45 mins away. It is also located very close to where some of the river rafting  trips begin. Rishikesh town is now a crowded & bustling place.

One night we were able to have dinner on the terrace, which was a nice experience and very private.

The silence of the place and its sorrounding hills here is broken only by that gushing River, and occasional thunder of the rain cloud.

Then the flowers and trees in the garden will be in blossom, and you can see lots of butterflies. The garden is lovely, with lots of places to sit and have tea and look at the river. The rooms are charming and pittoresque with antiques and details, the Neemrana signature! Staff is friendly.",Scandinavian_Norw,/Profile/Scandinavian_Norw,"New Delhi, India",50
almora,"After having read only positive reviews / comments on other travel sites regarding the Glasshouse, I expected much more out of this property.  In short:   Positives: Good location - a few steps down from the main building and guest rooms is the river Ganges. A small, short, rocky beach provides for a good spot to relax, enjoy the beautiful view and listen to the river run.   Decent Dinner - the food was average, but with plenty of options for both veg and non-veg dishes.   Negatives: Bad location (yes, there is a bad side to the location as well)- the hotel is a solid 40 minute drive along a single lane road  (which runs along a cliff) to the center of Rishikesh.  Both the hotel and our driver advised against doing the drive to town in the evening.  Run down building and guest",RBNY,/Profile/RBNY,NY,20
almora,This was our third trip to the Glasshouse and we decided to usher in the New Year this time. The Heritage hotel is located about 23 kms uphill from Rishikesh right on the banks of the river Ganges flowing downhill. The property is an orchard for tropical fruits like lichees and mangoes and was the summer resort of the royal family from a neighboring district. The lavish gardens lead down to a sandy beach on the riverside from where one can feel the clear and pristine waters of the Ganges and watch the rafts go down the rapids. The hotel has a few rooms in the main building and several cottages and tented accomodation spread among the tree lined complex. The rooms have a colonial French touch and the interiors match the heritage background of the hotel. The food is excellent and,alokdutta,/Profile/alokdutta,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50

We were visiting Rishikesh and my friend was checking out properties with a view to see if she could organize a yoga retreat at a nice resort  When we got to the glasshouse, we ask to see the person in charge. we were shown to staff who had an office just by the side of the dining hall.  we explained the purpose of our visit. He wanted Rs200 per person to let us have a look at the property. We also wanted to have lunch. However the restaurant looked closed and no one was dining there even though it was lunch time. He said they only served a buffet.  With such poor staff attitude, we would not even consider this hotel if they offered free accomodation.

Like most of the Neemrana properties (which are either colonial or heritage properties), this one too was owned by the erstwhile Maharaja of Tehri. But along with royalty, the property has also become very dated. The rooms are musty and run down. Hot water supply in the bathrooms is erratic and the showers defunct. The walls are peeling and the buildings in desperate need of maintenance. The furniture in the room needs to be upgraded as well. The Thappar Guest House adjacent to the hotel can be a good point of reference on the maintenance & appearance of the property!!  The location of the Glasshouse is its greatest asset.

We had been calling the staff at the glasshouse regulary to be sure about the condition of the road. (It was only after booking the stay that we realised that it was further north of Rishikesh. Happy mistake) We stayed in the Room Jamuna overlooking the river Ganga. Given the homely nature of the hotel ( Neemrana promote their getaways not as hotels) we were at ease.

We even called from Haridwar which is a reasonably close even then we were told everything was fine and we could get there. When we arrived, we noticed the river was flowing close to the rooms, but thought it was normal based on their behaviour. As the vening progressed, the river got more violent and the water level started climbing quickly and started flowing on the sitting deck etc. We asked the attendants couple of times and they said it is all fine and we were on a higher floor.

When we had booked the rooms we had repeatedly asked about the road condition but we were not given the correct picture.  During monsoon they should warn the travelers before taking their booking, about the road condition. The location is picturesque, but since several regular acivities of other seasons were barred and outdoor movements were restricted due to rains, it became a little boring at times.

The 25km from Rishikesh to the Glasshouse were quite an experience (due to landslides, roadworks and indian driving style on a mountain roads). We have to admit, that we went there without booking in advance or checking availability. We are not convinced though, that all the rooms of the lower price-range were really taken as we were told, since only very few guests showed up during meal-times without any other possibility to get food in the vicinity. So we had to take the 2nd most expensive room. The room was quite nice, with about25m to the roaring ganges. Awesome!

almora,"I would not stay that this is an exceptional property but you definitely dont have better choices in Shivpuri area by the side of Ganges river and so close to rafting points.  The property is in a secluded area and once you start moving towards Shivpuri after rishikesh you keep wondering if you have crossed this one or it is still further down especially if you are moving late evening. The road signs to approach are few and are more likely to be missed if you are travelling in the evening. Also no restaurant choices around this hotel and thus you would have to take food from hotel which is expensively priced. On the positives, the property is neat and clean and has a parking space if you are on your own vehicle.The staff is warm and friendly.

The Glass House is about 20km from Rishikesh and the road to it very bad. So no escape in the evening. Food is a buffet with nearly the same dishes every evening under different names - heaven only knows how often they have been warmed up. And it is expensive. The worst food we have had during our 3 weeks in India. And they are mean as well: we travelled with our own driver and it is standard practice that the hotel feeds the drivers of guests with car and driver. Not this one, they probably dumped the food when it could no longer be warmed up. We offered to pay for our driver to have dinner in",Namiya,/Profile/Namiya,Pulham,30

So for our annual weekend family getaway for about 15 people in the age group of 7 to 70 yrs we chose this property.

It is situated right on the banks of the Ganges and the river looks absolutely breathtaking. The sound of continuous water flow makes one always realize the proximity to the river. There is a private sandy-rocky beach of the hotel. We spent a lovely morning there...playing in water etc. The hotel does not serve food / tea on the beach to keep it tidy.

almora,We were a group of 4 couples with one child each. This is a very popular and possible the only viable option for a lot of upper middle vacationers wishing to go to Rishikesh. Popularity can be gauged from the fact that the owners collect 25%-50% advance for accepting bookings for this property.  The property is really about 20+ kms after Rishikesh on the road to Badrinath. The property is situated just of the river and has a riverbeach attached to it. Great for people interested in about 3-5 bathing sessions in the ganges. We sure were.   The property is designed more like a large bungalow with a single large lobby acting as a dinning area and activity room for guests.

Right on the bank of the river. All the rooms are nicely stocked, but dont expect a typical city hotel service.   Pricing is slightly on the higher side, especially when you count in the food charges (which is most likely to happen, since there is nothing closeby as a dining option).   ideal time to visit would be oct-nov and mar-apr, since the remaining months would be either too cold or too hot (yes, even though located in the mountains, it does get pretty hot).

And its not the 20km that makes it a challenge to visit, but the incredibly bad road you have the travel.  Hair pin turns, construction, and rock slides make it a less than relaxing trek to and fro.  Our room, Godavari was one of the least expensive options at 3500rps per night.

The resort is situated by the river Ganges (hence the name) & offers ample parking for about 6-8 cars, which would suffice for the guests since the total number of cottages in the property does not exceed 8.
