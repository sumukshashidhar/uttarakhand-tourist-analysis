almora,"While going from Delhi to Almora, had a chance to stay at Woodsvilla Resort, Ranikhet. It is right on the main road and has a spacious parking lot of its own so no parking problems. The property is large and is spread across many levels. The rooms are large and spacious, toilets clean, linen and toiletries of good quality. Our room had a beautiful view. All rooms are located in such a manner that they all have an un-obstructed view of the Himalayas. One can sit at the bay window sipping tea and viewing Himalayas t a distance. The resort has lots of activities for children too. Great value for money.",Shivam Sharma,/Profile/Sharma7262,,50
almora,This is one of the best places to stay in Majkhali. Had stayed here for a night on my way back from Munsiyari way back in November 2017. The rooms are nice and big with all the modern amenities. The balcony is nice and big and gives a panoramic view of the valley below. If you are interested in photography you can spend hours in the balcony. The food too served at the hotel is great. Overall a lovely place. ,Pankaj Toppo,/Profile/Toppopankaj,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50

Staff was very nice. They took special care in serving tawa roti at night, specially for us. I would highly recommend it. Kid's area with lot of balls was a treat for the children. TT table also kept them occupied.  Some improvements: 1 - It can be arranged and managed better. Eg: It has a beautiful library but books need to be arranged. Also, kid's room and gym equipment should be separated as some smaller kids can get hurt. Battery driven cars are spoilt and should be cleaned. 2 - Staff is very helpful. With some Hotel Management training and a common dress, it will give a good professional look. 3 -",manu5577,/Profile/manu5577,"New Delhi, India",40

They sent their cars to an important close by intersection to guide our bus to the resort. So that we don’t waste any time finding the place.  2.	The check in was smooth and the welcome drink (Tea) was accompanied with some delicious pakoras. This was a blessing as the journey from Delhi to the resort was a long an exhausting one.  3.

I expect a resort to have some open spaces to walk around (gardens etc.) and facilities for recreation for adults and children. But there are none. This is just a good hotel. Secondly, it is not suitable for senior citizens and those with some problem in climbing stairs. There are lots of stairs to climb. Apart from these, the place has all positives. The Himalayan view from the rooms is awesome. On a clear day the snow clad peaks such as Trishul, Nandadevi etc. can be clearly seen.

almora,"We were there for a very short stay. Just 1 night and regret it because the hotel is worth staying for atleast 3-4 days. THe location is superb though 1km away from any market. The Himalaya and a grand valley is visible from the balcony of almost all rooms. THe Property is exquisite. Very well maintained. Very charmingly designed. We had planned to have the dinner in the room but once I had a look at the restaurant, it was so nice that we had food there. THe food and the service in the restaurant was simply superb.  THe person in cahrge at the reception was the only spoiler in the entire stay. He was cordial during the day alright but come night , he was simply too drunk to do anything !!! Overall I can say, I may visit Ranikhet again only to stay more in this Hotel !!!",VINAYBHAVE,/Profile/VINAYBHAVE,mumbai,40
almora,"I have stayed this hotel from 10 to 12 march 2014.Location wise the hotel is very good u can see the himalayas from the room balcony.The restaurant manager is very humble and good person and food quality is excellent. The rooms are clean and spacious. Now i will come to the cons,The next morning there was no hot water in the room i call reception then they had given some hot water in the bucket, they rectify the problem on the same day and in the evening hot water was available. The major problem starts on the next evening when weather was bad. In the whole night the electricity has gone almost 6 times and every time it took half hour to come again. I tried to call receptionist regarding electricity problem and what i found is that my phone was dead. My whole night was in fear",mohammadamir,/Profile/mohammadamir,"New Delhi, India",30

The chef too is excellent and we were served very tasty meals.The rooms offer an excellent view of the Himalayan range and the bay windows help.The curtains in the room were however a little run down and a few light fixtures were not in place.,shakunNewDelhi,/Profile/shakunNewDelhi,new delhi,40

almora,"I stayed in Woodsvilla for 2 nights in November'13. The first and foremost thing you will notice here is the enthusiastic staff. Right from the time you reach till the time you leave, they are ever ready to help you. The best part of this Hotel is that you will get a fantastic view of Himalayas directly while simply lying on the bed in your room!!! The view of 'Golden Himalaya' during sunrise and sunset is bliss!! The rooms are clean and spacious. The heater needed to be of a better quality. It was not enough to warm the room. Hotel gives an option of Tea/Coffee/soft drink as a part of welcome drink. We requested them to make ginger tea and it was awesome! They would also serve cookies daily. Food was again up to the mark. They have good variety of food available. I would rate",Saurin Gandhi,/Profile/SaurinGandhi,"Mumbai, India",50

Its big enough for a family of 4. The breakfast and dinner included were good. We are vegetarians, but there was enough variety for us. Food was good and service was excellent. The hotel rooms are not centrally heated but they provided us with 2 blower heater which were good in November but I doubt if it would be of impact in colder weather. 2 Bathrooms were decently sized and had all basic amenities.

I visited the resort in Oct 2012, with my whole family consisting of 6 people. The stay was awesome and food was great. It is a bit far from Ranikhet but then it all depends on your choices. If you are a Himalayan lover and want to enjoy breathtaking Himalayan view far from the hustle of the town, then woodsvilla is the right choice. If you like to be in the crowd then may be you wont enjoy the place.  The view from the balcony of our room was unforgettable where we could see nanda devi...trishul parvat so clearly.

Before we reached there, I was having few doubts as there were not as many reviews for this hotel as for the other ones. But after visiting Ranikhet and seeing other hotels from outside, I would honestly recommend this place to every one. This hotel is having the best location in Ranikhet and probably one of the best maintained.  This hotel is located in Majkhali village (Ranikhet-Almora Road) around 10 Kms north of Ranikhet, away from the noise and madness of Sadar Bazar.

After you would have driven through the city and you are nearing the Gold Course (maintained impeccably by the Indian Defense Forces) you should start keeping an eye out for the sign board for Woods Villa. We went there last month (August) , plonk in the middle of monsoons and the place can't be more shrouded in greenery than at any other time of the year! It was stunning and we have never seen anything looking so green and gorgeous. The place was growing, sprouting and oozing everything plant-y from every nook and cranny.  And oh, about the resort.

The hotel is built on the hillside quiet away from the Ranikhet City (14 Kms approx) , not many people like the idea of staying far away from the city but we were happy being away from the crowds so its a matter of personal choice there...

The check-in was smooth Since the hotel is built on a hill/ plateau. it consists of many stairs..walking to and fro  from room to reception made us loose 2 pounds of weight. Cleanliness. Didnot feel this was up to snuff. But I think there's only so much clean these rooms can probably get. It's got that sort of old feeling that it always feels a bit dirty no matter how much you wipe.

Bad Points: - Rooms situated well below the reception area. This makes going up there a very tedious trek which may be unsuitable for pregnant women, elderly people and others with physical disabilities.
