almora,"Dear reader, I would like to say directly that after an extremely positive first experience in India in 2018, I have returned this year to spend a few quiet and loving days, especially in this place. If I had not landed here by chance during my first trip to India as a European, I cannot say if I would have started another long journey to India. And this cheerful place is one of the reasons why I will always start a long and tiring but beautiful and magic journey to India. I returned after 2 years and felt like I was arriving at my second home. All the people in this house have grown very close to my heart and have literally become family members. Hospitality and interest is very important here and you become a friend and family member within a few days. The food was again",Tom S,/Profile/Tomtomser1,,50

almora,"I stayed for a week and my heart has stayed forever! I was looking for a place for some R&R in the Himalayas and couldn't find a homestay that also gave me creature comforts of the city...until I found Deodar Homestay. Lovingly put together by Shekhar and Binita, the rooms are simple chique with beautiful vistas of the mountains and plenty of natural light. Hari and Prakash are STARS in housekeeping and the kitchen and you'll be treated to the loveliest farm to table meals, especially plates and plates of Kumaoni food. There is also a traditional 'maalish' lady and a masseuse available on request and a delightful steam room for use. Although located in the heart of town, this is the most posh address in Almora and is shaded by tall Cedar trees.

almora,"Staying at Deodar Homestay has redefined my concept of homestays for ever. As if staying in a beautifully decorated old colonial house on a hilltop in the middle of a true oasis of peace, among pines, rhododendrons and wildlife wasn't enough, I spent a couple of nights in what was without question the most comfortable bed that I have come across in my six months of travelling so far. As I spent my days enjoying the peace and quiet of this exceptional region, going on walks and watching breathtaking sunsets, I returned every night to a wonderful shower in a beautiful and spotlessly clean room, in a house that is full of incredibly warm and hospitable people. In no time I felt like I'd found a new family, here in India. Oh and have I mentioned the food? Prakash and Hari prepare",elias,/Profile/eliasopreis,,50
almora,"The beautiful old house is furnitured in colony style. The rooms are spacious and there is not one terrace, there are many. A garden with flowers, birds, ducks and dogs. Just to sit on comfortable chair and seize the view is an experience. The breakfast was superb. There is nothing left to ask. From fresh fruits to eggs any style. Or indian. Whatever you prefer.  The owners were extremely helpful and caring. They arranged a trip for us. Arranged transport, helped with all our needs. I can only recommend this place.  We had dinner and lunch and it was delicious and homemade and tasty. ",Katrin D,/Profile/976katrind,"Berlin, Germany",50
almora,"We stayed at Deodar Homestay for 3 days in the month of June. A beautiful, well maintained place. The owner is a wonderful human being and the most generous host we have ever come across. The food is simple, sumptuous and served with much love by Prakash. The support staff is warm, well trained and environment conscious. It's truly a home away from home.

almora,We went in a group of about 10 people in May ‘19. The property is in Cantt area and that too on top most point of Almora. It gives beautiful views of the clear sky and neighboring mountains. It’s a British Era property restored in a beautiful manner. The place has all amenities of a good hotel. The food served is purely homely and freshly prepared as per the guest’s requirement. The staff is cooperative and helpful in every manner. A must visit place 😊 ,S_Khanna32,/Profile/S_Khanna32,,50

almora,"Deodar Homestay is a beautiful property that charms one at first sight. Add to it the very welcoming and warm hosts/owners Shekhar and Vinita and their 'Man Friday'--estate manager Rajat Pande, always at hand to ensure that one's stay is comfortable. While on adventure tour, we (our band of merry women)stayed here just for a day but it was worth the experience. The flowers were in full bloom, the weather perfect and in that one day we were able to pack in a lot of sightseeing and visits to local tourist spots. Blessed with an advantageous location, Deodar Homestay is a perfect retreat, an escape from the heat and dust, the madding crowd and urban chaos!

almora,"My husband and I stayed at this beautiful homestay where the host Rajat, welcomed us very warmly. The site is located on top of a cliff, allowing the guests a magnificent view of the Himalayas. The building was built in the British era- further renovated by the owner while still maintaining the ancient architecture. Therefore you can expect high ceilings, large doors, a fireplace with a royal touch. The well maintained gardens, glass house, bird houses and ponds add to the beauty of this place. This place is highly recommended and please make sure to order a plate of butter chicken and momo. The place will exceed your expectations.",Sitashma S,/Profile/sitashmas2018,"Kathmandu Valley, Nepal",50
almora,"Staying in this place in Almora, a city at the foot hills of the Himalayas, will make your India experience 100% better. The house is located at the top of a mountain with a beautiful view where you can just get lost watching the beauty of Almora nature. But most amazing thing about this place are all the people that you will meet during your stay, first the host Shekhar who is great to talk with the whole night with some wine, especially if you're coming from outside of India, you will enjoy talking to him and his family as they are very caring and hospitable. Then the whole team that is working in the kitchen is just so funny if you get to know them and the food they made is just better than anything else we found during our stay in India.

almora,"My husband and I stayed at Deodar Homestay for 9 days.  While we love India, our stays in other hotels could not compare to what we experienced here.  Such a lovely mountain setting with beautiful views and grounds.  Our room was spacious, modern, yet cozy with a lovely wood stove for the cool afternoons and evenings.  We were treated as more than guests - more like honored family members as we celebrated my husband's 74th birthday with wine and dancing by all!  Thank you Shakur and family for your hospitality.  We cannot leave a review without mentioning Rajat, an amazing young man, who was available to us for any request from a special meal to train tickets and taxis.

almora,"I chose this guesthouse for some rest and relaxation after getting sick, but what I got was so much more! The people here are beyond lovely and really make sure you feel at home. And in the kitchen Prakash, Hari (the true master of momo), Deepak, and Rajhat are always cooking something delicious (they even grow some of their own produce)! The location is peaceful while still being walking distance to the markets, and easy to do day trips to nearby areas and temples! Rooms were great, and you can get a killer sunset view of the Himalayas! The little gardens around the property make it a perfect spot to just hang out. I didn't want to leave and will definitely be back !",snana777,/Profile/snana777,,50
almora,We stayed here for a week and loved every bit of it. The location of the homestay is just perfect - you get beautiful view of the Himalayas. There’s also a lot of space around to just sit and relax. You can literally spend hours here without getting bored. Our hosts were great and made us feel like a part of the family.  It’s a luxurious house - the room is stunning and very neat. The bed is really comfortable and there’s everything that you need here. What we liked the best was how effectively they used all the resources available - there isn’t a single thing that goes waste. They have their own kitchen & herb garden so everything that you eat here is super organic and healthy. It’s the best place to stay when in Almora. ,Sneha | 2 Miles,/Profile/sneha2miles,"New Delhi, India",50
almora,"I visited Deodar Homestay with my family and stayed here for one night. The property is a gorgeous haven tucked amidst the tranquil environs of Almora Cantt. We were taken aback by its beauty the minute we stepped into our rooms. Our room was tastefully done up, it was clean, cozy and comfortable; the best part about it was the fact that it also had a fireplace! We especially loved our breakfast in their beautifully landscaped garden with two dogs and a few ducks lazing around. Prakash Bhaiya and Didi made us scrumptious meals, the staff was extremely kind and made us feel very welcome.

almora,"We were little sceptical when we booked Deodar homestay. But woahh what kind of a place it turned out to be. It was our most luxurious stay in mountains ever. Deodar homestay is located in cantt area of Almora. I might be overwhelming but location of this homestay is mind blowing, it’s so close to centre point of city and still so calm and isolated. Shekhar and his family are fabulous host and even being with them for a week only, we feel like part of his family. Before talking about room, I would like to mention one important thing and that’s food. Prakash Bhaiya and Hari Di are amazing cook and you’ll have mouth watering food every single time.

He also helped us plan our sightseeing better. The property is located close to the market and is beautiful with a wonderful view of the morning sunrise and the Himalayas. The rooms are luxurious and aesthetically decorated. The adorable golden retrievers, Lica & Cliff are a delight to play with.  Definitely recommend staying here if you're looking for a memorable stay in Almora.",Compass11854417392,/Profile/Compass11854417392,,40
almora,"We had the best time at Deodar Homestay! Rajat was an excellent host. We had booked the homestay on the same day that me and my friends were travelling from Delhi. Even though it was last minute, Rajat made sure that we got the best room with a beautiful view of the Himalayas. The rooms were absolutely clean with a decor and furnishing that was no less than that of a 5 star accommodation. Loved the massive breakfast spread as well where you get really tasty Indian as well as continental options. Honestly, the room was a steal at a price we got it. The best part was that the property has 3 adorable golden retrievers who are gentle and extremely friendly.

almora,"I planned staying a couple of days here, but I ended up spending a whole week at this magnificent place. I cannot remember feeling so at home at a new place - and then even in India (I'm from Denmark)! I arrived late evening and was led to my cozy high-ceilinged room and had my (very late) dinner in the living room afterwards - a very warm welcoming.  This old British house creates a pleasant atmosphere, and the interior design complements the style well. The staff is friendly and trustworthy, and the food they serve is the best Indian food I've had. The surroundings are peaceful and the view of the Himalayan mountains is the cherry on the top. All in all a wonderful place and definitely a place I'll revisit. See you soon!   Kristian Villebro from Denmark",kristianvillebro,/Profile/kristianvillebro,"Copenhagen, Denmark",50
