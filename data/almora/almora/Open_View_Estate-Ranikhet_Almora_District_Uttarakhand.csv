almora,"I stayed in ""Open View Estate"" cottage for three days and found days worth spent. The property is located in a very scenic place and has beautiful view of Himalayan range from balcony or estate. Entire cottage was beautiful and clean with spacious bedrooms, drawing and dining hall. The best part is - it's a home away home. The USP is owner Mr. Ashok Mehrotra and caretaker Gopal ji. Food was as if eating at home and never had any issues with service. I would like to thanks Mr.Ashok Mehrotra and Gopal ji for the hospitality given to us. Wish another trip to Ranikhet.",Sumit,/Profile/sumitsoral,,50
almora,"When you are a family or a big group, you need a cozy space where you can all chill together, plan together and stay together! I have personally been on multiple trips in a group with friends or family but what I have always hated is being confined to different rooms in hotels (and sometimes on different floors) which at times bound us to even basic communication. We do keep a track of each other on Whatsapp or phone extensions but itâ€™s not too convenient most of the times. It looses the whole purpose of travelling in a group.   Our choice for a family of 5 who wanted to stay together with all the comforts was Open View Estate in Ranikhet! A 2 bedroom cottage (they have one bedroom and three bedroom cottages as well) became our perfect abode! A little isolated from the main",ChicLifeByte,/Profile/chiclifebyte,"New Delhi, India",50
almora,Its hard to find peaceful stays in Ranikhet. But this one was just amazing. They even have an indoor fireplace and the view from the balcony is awe-inspiring. All of their rooms over white peaks. i would recommend this place for anyone who is looking for a home away from home.,Ishank A,/Profile/WanderingSince89,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",50

almora,"I was there with my friends for 2 days. I found the owner, Mr Mehrotra too helpful and gentle. He guided me all the way to reach to the hotel. The hotel staff Mr Gopal gave us a home feeling at a far distance. ",Deepak T,/Profile/DeepakT705,,50
almora,"Spent 3 days at the Open View Estate Ranikhet, at the start of October. Old Bungalow run by Mr Mehrotra. Two storied with 3 nice bedrooms with view of the mountains, a well spread drawing dining hall, opening into a nice terrace. Quiet,  far from the madding crowd, yet not so far. You can hear the birds chirping and also the music wafting in from the distant corner of the hills. The furnitures do need some more upkeep, but the whole time care taker Gopalji more than makes up with his hospitality. He cooks the breakfast , lunch or dinner, whatever you ask. Always on the call to help you out. If you like a quiet comfortable place to enjoy the hills just go for Open View. I had a nice cozy three days with my wife, relaxing and enjoying the ambience. I hope Mr Mehrotra will do up",Bireswar R,/Profile/BireswarR,"Mumbai, India",40
almora,"It is somebodys summer home that you rent for a day or two. The location is not very good. The rooms are old, small and lack modern facilities.   If you are travelling as a family take the entire cottage. 2 rooms and a lobby. Service and food is basic.  On the positive side, the rooms have a rustic feel and you dont really need all that luxury. Do you?",anujgarg1,/Profile/anujgarg1,Moradabad,20
