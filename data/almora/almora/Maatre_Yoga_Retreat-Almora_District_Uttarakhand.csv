almora,"A hidden gem amidst mountains, just the perfect distance from a crowded corbett. This place has the perfect balance of relaxing and wilderness quotient. Located amidst mountains, every cottage has a beautiful view! Tons of activities within a short walk would give more breathtaking views of river and mountains. Rooms are very smart & comfortable, food is homely and delicious. This is just the perfect relaxing getaway you can imagine! ",kushal313,/Profile/kushal313,"New Delhi, India",50
almora,The river is just across the road and you can hear it. The lawn in the middle is the common play an hang out area for kids and adults alike. The food is simple but tasty. No restaurant fare. The swim in the river in the mid-afternoon was the high point.. As was the moonrise over the mountains. Across the ricver is Corbett - not a single building is in sight there.  This place has the homely relaxed feel which is the exact opposite of a resort. And its small size (just 8 guest rooms) makes it very warm and personal.  Very highly recommended. We know we will definitely be back.,Chetanmahajan,/Profile/Chetanmahajan,"Satkhol, India",50
