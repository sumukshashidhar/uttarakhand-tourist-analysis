almora,"Although I must say, binsar oak paradies is an excellent choice for a leisure couple/family trip. Property is situated in a lash green Himalayan foothills. scenic beauty is terrific of this resort.Now few key comments: 1. rooms are very neat and clean however, we stayed in a first floor room with personal balcony.  2. food is delicious and cooking staffs specially Raju bhaiya is so jolly in nature and humble to serve any kind of delicious food as per your choice.  3. bathroom is western culture and very clean.   Few things I want to mention for its betterment. 1. entrance road is bad specially for cars. 2. as it is situated in a open ground, so privacy must be taken care of. 3.no almira or anything in the room to keep your luggage or dresses. 4. little far from binsar sanctuary.",Tauseef Khan,/Profile/Tauseef1986,,50

almora,"Binsar oak paradise is the very best option to stay and have a wonderful view of nature. In the morning you can visit the viewpoint for a view of Himalayas. Nature around the hotel is best, it will give you peace. Rooms are good and food is also good.  Surrounded by mountains, best view from the room. So many birds and the best of nature. All the staff is very good and co-operative. The owner Ashok Kumar is the best person I met in Uttarakhand during my journey. They manage taxi booking for the whole trip and all. Amazing stay. Must Visit.",vaghela_akshay7,/Profile/vaghela_akshay7,"Ahmedabad, India",50
almora,"I visited here with my family and found it one of the best place to stay in my whole travelling experience of 10 years, here is the detailed feedback:  Positive: 1) Valley and Mountain View 2) Peace and no noise of vehicles (Away from road) 3) Trekking available nearby (You don't need to drive anywhere else) 4) Greenery and Wheat field beside 5) Great Service-never say not attitude (Raju and Rohit) 6) Ghar jaisa khana (Feels like home made food) 7) Mobile Network is good 8) Less number of rooms - means less crowd and you can enjoy your privacy/family time 9) Small market at walk able distance  10) Mr Ashok is owner of the resort, Gentleman and soft spoken  Can be better: 1) Approach road is not so good (though no issues if you have driver or you are expert driver) ",Krishna Rathore,/Profile/krishRat,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",50
almora,"Its a small hotel in Dhaulchina, surrounded by mountains, Himalayas can be seen from a point which is 500 meters away from this place, we didnt get chance to see as the weather was cloudy. Rooms and bathrooms are well maintained. Food is prepared fresh and tastes like homemade food.  We did booking directly from hotel and got good deal. We saw some beautiful birds from our balcony. Overall it was a nice experience.  ",Roopesh_M,/Profile/Roopesh_M,"Mumbai, India",40

almora,"This place is definitely more than what you expect. Very homely, cosy and refreshing. The manager, cook and staff are very hospitable. They will look after all the small things for you. Mr Ashok did provide a local guide for vrudh jageshwar trek. The food is good and rooms new and clean. The view is excellent and you can hear the chirping of the birds from your balcony in the morning. There are many tiny treks from this place, the best being the one to Maa Anandamamayee ashram. Do call this place directly for a great price. Access is from the dhaulchinna market on a dirt road which makes it difficult for some cars. A memorable stay!",PRIYAL G,/Profile/pryl_g,"Mumbai, India",50
almora,"Rooms are good . Food is very nice , the cook was really good chef and he listens to everything . They do not cheat you but they will charge you for every service they are giving . So do not assume anything for free . The view is good from the rooms and  the place is worth the money .",Sonam Lodhi,/Profile/sonamlodhi89,,40
almora,"Binsar Oak Paradise is located about a kilometer away from the main market of Dhaulchhina, amidst lush greenery and sunlit mountains. There are a couple of other accommodations around, but the nature is quite serene, and you can spot various birds if you can wake up early in the morning before most of the tourists get up and start a hullabaloo. The gravel road leading to the property from Dhaulchhina is pathetic though and needs immediate repairing before some elderly person gets a slipped disk. The manager is very friendly and hospitable, and the food they cater is tasty as well, though at times a little exorbitantly priced. The hotel is very new and very neat and clean; you do not need to bother about hygiene or cleanliness. Ample parking space is available for cars, too.",Kumaraditya S,/Profile/KumaradityaS1,"Diamond Harbour, India",40
almora,"our group of three family stayed there for two nights. It is really an amazing experience. When I booked this place I have many doubts,but after reaching there we feel that we should have one more day to stay there. A well maintained property with mesmerizing views near about. No need to go anywhere for sight seeing this site is already provide you very beautiful and refreshing views. Home type environment, simple and fresh food and a loving take care staff and owner make it perfect stay for you. We enjoyed every bit if our stay there and want to repeat a trip very soon . Good luck Ashok Ji .",Saurabh Chauhan,/Profile/saurabhkrishana,"Greater Noida, India",50
almora,"We were a group of 5 friends and paid the visit in the third week of november. The resort is really beautiful and not much crowded. The staff was really very cooperative and made the arrangements like Bonfire and a river side outing, chargeable though. The rooms are really spacious and have wooden architecture. The view from the room is breath taking especially during the dusk and dawn. They cook food of your own choice and have a separate dinning room in case you wanna dine together. We made the fooding (thrice a day) of around ₹7600/- in two days for five ppl. We had out breakfast in the sunshine outside the resort. There’s a view point of the mighty Himalayas just 500 mts from the resort.It is a must go and unputdownable in case you want to spend quality time with your",ABH30SHEK,/Profile/ABH30SHEK,"New Delhi, India",50
