almora,"Probably one of my best discoveries so far. Right from the start, I was pleasantly surprised. The whole experience of hiking to get to the cottages, with thoughtfully marked directions built up my expectations that were more than met. I expected a down to earth, somewhat experiential living, which it was. Then also there were touches of luxury (welcome smoothie, hot water delivery to the room, hot water bottles to keep under the blanket in the cold nights, etc.)  that left me feeling treated well.  I had booked a dorm room, expecting to meet other travellers, but learnt that I could not check in as the other travellers locked the place before leaving for their excursions. I was given a free upgrade to a full cottage, where I continued staying past the first day. Since they won't",Sulabh Mahajan,/Profile/sulabhSyd,Bangalore,50

Great hospitality and personalised care taken by the staff and the manager. I mean everything had a personal touch.   2.  Food was all organic stuff which was so tasty , healty, nutritious and had local flavour.  3.  Trek was not so difficult and was full of scenic beauty. The Guide provided by the Manager was experianced and was very helpful.   4.  Cost was very much affordable and was value for money.   Negetive :   well the only negetive aspect initially was very poor mobile connectivity. However,  later on I realised that this allowed me to connect with my family specially during evening Bon fire🔥 and soup arranged by the staff for us.

Mani and Kamal are gracious, attentive hosts, and ensured that our visit was wonderful.  The village is remote, but the point is to get away from the stress of the modern world.

The cottages are just awesome and made me wonder of the awesome arrangements in the midst of nowhere in the hills.   The food is cooked using what they grow.  It tastes delicious,  fresh and organic.    The views are spectacular because you stay amidst the hills. People are helpful beyond imagination. They deserve to be promoted.  Now for Nag tibba Trek, I guess The Goat Village is a perfect stop. Camping has become too mainstream.  The Goat Village will take ample care of you during your stay and will provide brilliant guides for the trek.    Be a part of it.  You will love it.  You will cherish it.

almora,Fabulous trek... You feel so close to nature that it rejuvenates you right upto the core. The facilities a brilliantly sober and the fact about homegrown vegetables and other eatables is so very true.  We friends had a wonderful time the hospitality was excellent and the trek is fantastic too.  And yes... The PAY WHAT YOU LIKE scenario is also true. :-)  So pack your pags and head here.  Advise:  Make ur bags light and carry powerbanks for ur devices :-),Ankit R,/Profile/AnkitR351,,50
almora,"Life does don't stop even if you are alone ! Was worried how should I go ahead for solo trip ? Bore, alone, travelling all alone to Uttarakhand ! So it's not the case when you visit to Goat Village, Pantwari, Uttarakhand ! Initially I had word with Rupesh Rai and made up my mind to go there and stay for two nites !!  I was welcomed by Prem @ Pantwari bus stop and he took me in his bike upto half way of the mountain and then our trekking started for 1 hour. It was very pleasant ride to see zigzag road and the paddy field from mountain. I couldn't stop clicking pictures seeing the beautiful view of the hill ! When reached the Goat Village, they gave me nimbu paani which was amazing welcome drink.. seeing the cottages and the flowers I forgot the tiredness !! My two nite stay on",Priyatosh D,/Profile/priyat0shd,,50
almora,"Beautiful vistas  and GV's ever wonderful staff! The location is pristine and far away from the madding crowds. It is the ultimate 'tech detox' location. Once here, it is recommended that one tucks away their cellphones in their bags and enjoys the crisp air and the blues of the sky. The only probable reason I believe a cellphone should be used is capturing the surreal beauty of this place. It's a must visit and the more time you spend here, one realises the futility of our city lives! Came back refreshed and recharged. Planning another trip in March already! This time around with lots of friends!",Shruti P,/Profile/492shrutip,,50
almora,"We had been meaning to do the Nag Tibba trek for a really long time. Having come across some good reviews about the Goat Village, we decided to ensure that we did it this year! What a great way to close this year. We visited Nag Tibba in the month of early December. We were hosted by the Goat Village. The experience was mind blowing and it did give us some friends for life (a trekking team was staying too). Our trek was organised by the GV staff (trained at the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering). We completed our trek to the Jhandi top, all thanks to the experienced Pradeep ji! We are definitely visiting again!",PK S,/Profile/254pks,,50
almora,"Goat Village! Wow!: What a brilliant location! Open from all three sides and the fourth side gives you views of the various ranges such as Bandarpoonch range. The location is the real jewel of the Goat Village. It is very close to the Nag Tibba top. In fact, it is the mid-point of the Nag Tibba trek if one is starting their trek from Pantwari side. During our stay of 3 days we walked and we ate to heart's content. There are many other smaller trails that you can explore with your kids. The goats at the village would be an added attraction for your kids! We loved the mountains, the fresh air and the Goat Village experience.   Note: Tough for the elderly. There is some trekking to do to reach the site. One can request for mules. The luggage is taken care of by the staff.",anupam p,/Profile/773anupamp,,50
almora,"Awesome place to visit. Nearest to NagTibba and best suited to trekkers to NagTibba. Service is awesome and offers a nice view to nearby hills. Food quality is also good. Local drinks provided are also good and better than any other branded ones in market. Only thing that it lags is electricity and due to this, i could not charge my mobile phone even, left me cut-off from the other part(s) of this world and my family..:( I am sure management will be working on it soon as place is in development phase.  I cannot skip mentioning the name of my tour guide (Prem) who was very cooperative and helpful in my entire tour. Thanks Prem and do keep the spirit up..:)  Overall i rate it 8 on the scale of 10..:)",VIKAS_SUMAN,/Profile/VIKAS_SUMAN,"New Delhi, India",40
almora,"It is worth the effort of getting here. IF one is looking to completely get away from the city din, no place better than the Goat village. It has all the basic comforts, is clean, service is very good and staff are very attentive. Evenings are spent around a bonfire and walks about the village take you past picturesque traditional farms and very firendly hospitable people.",thejunglelife,/Profile/thejunglelife,"New Delhi, India",50
almora,The Goat village is worth the visit. Its is cut off from the run of the mill touristy destinations. The staff are locally trained youth who retain the old world hospitality. The food is fresh and excellent. A perfect getaway.,Wasimk76,/Profile/Wasimk76,Delhi,50
almora,"Having heard of this place from a common friend, decided to 'take a look', while visiting Mussoorie on some work. Past Mussoorie, past Kempty Falls, upto Nainbagh (Shooter Jaspal Rana's home town, am told), and then onto Pantwari, we took a local taxi. At Pantwari market, we were met with an attendant from The Goat Village, who drove us uphill for another half hour or so, amongst a winding 'kacchhi sadak'. Here on we were to trek up to the Village, which we were told would be anywhere between 45 minutes to 75 minutes. Of course, we were tired by now, and the climb seemed a bit unnerving...but as we gained pace and height, the changing landscape made it more interesting to discover whats 'around the next bend'...and soon enough, we were at the Village, with goats roaming freely",dk_the_wanderer,/Profile/dk_the_wanderer,"Faridabad, India",50
almora,"The winding road takes us downhill from Mussoorie and the raw landscape merges into lush green step farms, and green mountains inter spread with rivulets and occasional water sources of pristine mountain water.  After around two hours of absolute bliss, comes the quaint little settlement of Pantwari, reaching where we are pointed to take a side road towards a dirt road winding on a steep incline. There we go and pleased to see that the road is wide enough for a two vehicles to easily cross...Finally there is a parking place where the vehicle is dropped and a welcome party complete with Ponies and helpers greet us to show the way to the ""Goat Village or Bakri Gaon""  The watch dial shines at around 5PM and twilight has started approaching when we start our ascent of around an hour",Anshumali,/Profile/Anshumali,"New Delhi, India",50
