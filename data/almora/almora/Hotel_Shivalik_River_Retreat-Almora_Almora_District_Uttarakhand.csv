I sat there in balcony for few hours just wondering the place around.  Apart for its beautiful location, room was nice and clean. Staff was also well behaved. It's was cold when I visited there almost between 0 to 4 degree. Ordered some hot food and that was tasty.  From the backside of hotel we can reach to the river.

almora,Easy to locate just by the side of the road. However it is around 12km away from the main Almora city.  Rooms were nice clear and big in size. Beds were comfortable. TV did not work. Washroom had 24x7 hot and cold running water. Room had a standard wardrob with a centre table and two wooden chairs with a big glass window facing the river side. A balcony with the same view were also there. However the direct view to river is blocked by an instititure and a temple. But it should offer a good view when the river flows full.  Food was freshly prepared and quality and quantity was good. Nothing exciting but also nothing to complain.  Sleep quality was good.  Overall a good place for a comfortable sleep provided you are ok with it's away location.,13it,/Profile/13it,"Bengaluru, India",30

Sitting out in the gallery we could get a vantage view of the Kosi as it flowed by, that itself was quite relaxing as also the idyllic location - being away from the crowd of Almora but yet a convenient location to move towards Binsar or Kausani. The Staff and Food both excelled. We are thankful for a memorable experience",k1tushat,/Profile/k1tushat,"Mumbai, India",50

almora,"TheAmoeba Shivalik River retreat is located 12kms away from the Almora town's hustle and bustle. Right in front of the river (stream at this time of the year.) The reception at the SRR was very welcoming and we felt very Comfortable.  The food served is very delicious ..  The only drawback I felt is the proximity to the road and also the sleep awakening mantra slogans from the temple right in front of us..  The sun temple is one of the nearest attractions in the area and it is definitely worth it. On the way to the sun temple , If you are lucky, you can see the snow capped peaks of the Himalayas. And It is definitely a sight to see.  It was an overall of a very good experience.. And I would recommend SRR to anyone passing through Almora ..",SoumNaz,/Profile/SoumNaz,"Pondicherry, India",40
almora,"Hotel Shivalik is a nice place to enjoy a peaceful holiday, specially if you are travelling with your family. Peaceful atmosphere, friendly Owner and staff plus very good vegetarian food, however would be good if you can travel with you own vehicle as the local driver are mostly made up of Bolero driver who's main job is driving their vehicle as local buses, not good at providing information also very expenses, Rs.2000/- for few hours of trip showing very few places around.Hotel Shivalik is good to just chill out and enjoy the local culture and the peace and quite having said that Hotel Shivalik in right next to NH87 therefore lots of traffic noise.
