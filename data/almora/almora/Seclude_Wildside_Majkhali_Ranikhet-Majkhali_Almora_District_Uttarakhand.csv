almora,"Where to start, where to end... as the name suggest, the place gives you the chills with the sheer beauty it is.. From property, to food, to landscapes around and very importantly, the people managing the place, I have just one word - outstanding.  The property is situated quite away from the main road, which meant that in our 3 night stay, didn't listen a single  horn blazing which in itself was a solace. Entire place has been very carefully designed and articulated -  from pillow covers to curtains to furniture and landscaping, everything is simple yet very elegant. Though it rained for entire day, i can say that never felt rain to be so beautiful (though it became pretty cold and remained mostly indoors).  For a nature enthusiast, it offers pretty good flora and fauna. One",Ankit_J031,/Profile/Ankit_J031,"New Delhi, India",50
almora,"I visited Seclude Majkhali with a couple of friends and Couldn’t have asked for a better weekend getaway. Top class hospitality by the property’s manager Sashi ji and the caretaker Sachin. The property is beautifully done with  all the modern amenities from room heaters to electric blankets and even a fire place in the living area. The panoramic view of the property is outstanding. One can see the Mighty Himalayas from the gazebo on a sunny day.  The food was home cooked food and tasted excellent.  The property also has a library equipped with a great collection of books of all types.  One can go rock climbing, zip lining (the second largest in India), go for various treks, hike to the nearly village, explore the water falls nearby or just relax at the property.

almora,An absolute hidden gem on a vast beautiful estate. Incredible hospitality given by Sashi and Sachin. The food was delicious and the environment perfect for a bit of rest and relaxation.  The cab driver arranged was resourceful and gave us the freedom to explore as much or as little as we wanted to.  We couldn’t be happier to have stumbled upon Seclude Wildside Majjkahali for our weekend getaway.. Super excited about the Seclude concept  of hotels homestyle and  eager to try the other Seclude properties. Thanks for providing a warm and creative alternative for us adventurous travelers.

almora,"Cudnt have ask for more from my stay. It was just awesome and the hospitality shown by the caretakers Shashi and the guy from assam was too gud. It was so f Difficult to leave the property and go anywhere else. Went for small trek as well which goes thru villages and reaches another beautiful village. Rooms are so big that it can easily accomodate family of four. The passion shown by the owner of this property is remarkable. Every small thing is taken into consideration and detailing is of the highest standards. Food was so gud that evertime I ended up over eating as it was super tasty(thanks to the cook-Shashi).  It was fantastic all the way.   Thanks,   Madhav Khanna",Maddy,/Profile/MaddyKhanna,,50

almora,"Everything at Seclude Wildside is perfect and full credit to its home-keepers for making this space superb by all means. Wonderful views, Nice rooms, good food and good hospitality by Shashi are surely the positives. Undoubtedly, anyone who stays here will be happy. Its not just the luxury and scenic views which will tempt you every minute, but the yummy food will tickle your cravings for quite a long time once you depart from this property.  Wonderful experience, absolutely tasty food of our choice, enough quantities, perfectly made to your taste including the spices (as we were travelling with our children), courteous staff, always available to make our stay comfortable. The rooms were well maintained and tastefully kept. The small nursery had a lot of quaint plants and there",Vaibhav,/Profile/Vaibhav_trip,,50
almora,"Seclude Ranikhet is nestled between innumerable green trees and sweet smelling flowers.  The home is beautiful and interior is done tastefully.  The property feels deeply personal and has a soul of its own. The staff is kind and took care of the smallest details for our comfort. The property has a small library, rich with brilliant books and weathered spines. I am told it is the owners personal collection which, to be honest, makes me deeply jealous.  I sat in front of the book shelves for good 20 mins before I could begin to touch the carefully collected and maintained books.  This was my first stay in a seclude home. And undoubtedly, I’ll make sure to go and stay at their other properties as well.  Thank you, Seclude!  SPECIAL SHOUTOUT to SHASHI-ji for being a brilliant chef,",Alvira K,/Profile/777alvirak,,50
almora,"Perfect for the price we got . Amazing independent cottage , tastefully decorated,with all the possible amenities,huge sprawling insides of cottage . Furnished with fireplace to lounge beds. It would be incomplete if i dont mention efforts of property caretaker mr Shashi sahu who always went out of his way to take best care of us,from serving customized meals as per our preference, arranging bonfire or barbeque, ensuring there is nothing which we may desire and is not available. A gem of a person. I would strongly recommend this property for friends, families and couples",flirtytraveller,/Profile/flirtytraveller,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",50
almora,"After much rigorous research, we found environmentally-committed accommodations in Uttarakhand, which far surpass soulless hotels and holiday resorts to offer spectacular, immersive, meaningful experiences in the mountains. And to top it all, Mr. Shashi Sahu, the caretaker is very considerate with proper detailing to our comfort. You can bonfire, barbeque and see amazing Himalayan range from trishul, Nanda Devi till Panchachuli Range right from the backyard. Or you can simply laze around in their mini library, or go hike to the nearby village.",Kinjal Singh,/Profile/Kinjalsingh,"New Delhi, India",50
almora,"After so much of research we chose this place and it turned out to be the best decision of ours.  We loved every bit of our stay there. We reached our destination in the late evening and as it was a bit secluded thus the super courteous staff came to pick us up and guide us to the venue.  We were stunned to see the property. Very well managed and it’s location add more to it’s charm.  Super beautiful hideout from the hustle and bustle of the city. Super courteous staff, that makes you feel at home. Property is 10 out of 10. But food was something that won my heart added more to our satisfaction. Super delicious food and excellent cook. 10 out of 10 for food.   Right from the booking till the departure everyone we interacted with were so courteous, humble and helpful.  Especially",Sangeet Kour Sandhu,/Profile/SangeetSandhu,,50
