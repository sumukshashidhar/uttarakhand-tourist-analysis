The inside of the property minds you of british era lodges and the rooms are exceptionally beautiful.   The food however was okay. The chicken curry was little bland and pieces undercooked. The pasta as well as fried rice was decent. Overall, excellent ambience but sub par food. ",Abhishek,/Profile/LucknowKebabi,"Lucknow, India",30

The restaurant, with a glass house entry ,is beautifully furnished with period furniture and presents anold world charm. As the weather was fine we chose to have lunch outdoors in the lovely Gardens, with trees ,resident Birds, flowers and a great view . The food and service was good and their Pahari Baaker Tari,a lamb curry with thin gravy, a local favorite was superb.

Windsor lodge is right off the road and located atop a hilltop. Its a layered structure and has sitouts & eating area on the ground floor. This sit out area  is used post evening for a nice camp fire. They have one of the most beautiful glass restaurant which looks pristine and is a great place for any meal. The food is good.

It's located very close the the arterial road but is not at all noisy. Which is a plus. Of course parking if it's a large SUV is difficult. Most customers who book after seeing the pictures on the hotel site are in for a disappointment. The real Windsor lodge is a small building with 5-6 rooms. Which are the top of the line category. The delux and other rooms are in the annexe of the lodge. And the first and last impression is that they don't have any sense of history or quaintness about them.

Clearly this property has seen its day and its owners have a couldn't care less attitude.   I was shocked to see it is an ITC affiliated hotel. It's a blotch on their reputation. Think of this as a 2 star motel!  About the only thing that worked for me were some of the staff members like Uday.

But @ 8k-10k per night, the rates are far too high to justify the lodge. Ultimately lack of options requires one to pay what is asked. We had no option but to stay at Ranikhet hence had to reside here. But if you have an option, then recommend that you look at better lodging probably at Ranikhet or Nainital.

Rooms are large and spacious, face the hills and prefer the ones on the higher floors towards the side for a better view. Food is good and the breakfast is not elaborate but decent. I would recommend trying their local dishes if you are not from Kumaon. The spa is nice but do not expect a 5 star. On special occasions they arrange a DJ and bonfires. On the Independence Day they organised a ghazal night. The best place is the ""maharaja of sheikhupura"" room - an old English",Archanbarua,/Profile/Archanbarua,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40

To a certain extent the property meets those expectations while on some others it is a big letdown.  Let’s look at the positives first.  1.	If you get one of the rooms which has a balcony the view you get from the place is phenomenal and soul nourishing. 2.	It is amazingly silent and quiet (as long as the occupancy in the hotel is low). If this feature attracts you then make sure that you don’t visit in the peak season time or during long weekends.  3.	The staff tries there level best and go out of their way to make you comfortable and meet your requests and demands.  4.	It is in a secluded location near the Golf course and you can if you wish to, go for long",SanjaySharma_69,/Profile/SanjaySharma_69,"Noida, India",40
almora,"Is  located in the  cantonment hill station town of Ranikhet, in Almora district of Uttarakhand. It was built as a charming colonial style hunting lodge, in 1909, due to the thick forests which abounded with wild life. It resembles a typical double story wood and stone English country house .Perched on a hillock, with forests of oak and pine, and, of spectacular views, of the snowy peaks of the Himalayas, such as the Nanda Devi and Trishul, amongst the more popular ones. The heaven touching apex peaks were sprinkled and swaddled with necklaces of the omnipresent  powdery snow.  How ever, a devastating fire destroyed it in 1948, and it remained as a neglected ruin, for about 50 years. Restoration work started in 1999, with great care to retain its original colonial architecture. ",Renu8,/Profile/Renu8,"New Delhi, India",40

Ranikhet is a bit remote and necessary services are less than predictable - so, the desire for a staff to make a guest's stay comfortable becomes extremely important.

The hotel has two buildings adjacent to each other and we were given rooms in the ""new building"" as we were told which is a few metres below the other building. Well to begin with it is a run down hotel...maintenance being the major issue. The room was huge with old wooden flooring and high ceilings..typical hill types houses.
