almora,We stayed in the Elite room which was decently good and comfortable. My wife is very particular about a clean room and washroom and she did not complain much about this place. The hotel is 2 mins walk from the towns main Mall road with small shops and cafes etc. It has a parking within the building and staff is friendly. The best thing about this hotel is the view from the bedrooms - amazing view of the valey below and the snow peaks beyond...,K Rastogi,/Profile/kkkkrrrrggggtttt,,40
almora,"New hotel, so room conditions are good.  But it seems to be kind of a money minded fraud hotel. They do a-la-karte style dinner (dinner was included in my tour package) but charged the starter as snacks item, not dinner. While ordering it was clearly mentioned that we can order starter as part of dinner, but during check out they denied. Even the hotel took the driver food bill twice, from both the driver and me. Their room service also was not up to the mark, asked for room moping 3 times, but never happened.",Joydeep C,/Profile/joydeepc2016,,30

almora,"Reached hotel milam in on 10th June in afternoon. Ambience of hotel is good. Can be given 9out of 10. But quality of food is poor. Even after suggesting non spicy food to CHEF, the food was too too spicy & not tasteful. Hope authority will look after this sensitive matter.",danupur,/Profile/danupur,"Uttarpara Kotrung, India",30

almora,Clean rooms and toilets. View of the town on the western ridge from the room. food was good and so was the room service. Wifi was fast. Situated near the main road but away from the crowd. Accesibility by taxi service and good parking facilities.,chiragpawan,/Profile/chiragpawan,"Dehradun, India",40
almora,"Its a fairly new hotel inaugurated in Oct 2016. The rooms are great with decent view of the valley & surrounding hills. The highlight of the hotel is its food, which is superb. Both veg & non-veg items were tasty and freshly prepared. Although the location may seem a bit congested to some, but its not a big concern when it comes to the overall stay in the hotel. Mr. Bisht and the entire hotel staff was very cordial, informative and helpful. The service was good if not great. I would definitely recommend Milam INN for an overall comfortable stay.",Devan_Kataria,/Profile/Devan_Kataria,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",40
