almora,If you are looking for a quiet place close to nature this is an excellent option. You have a beautiful view of the mountain peaks. You can practice your yoga by yourself overlooking the Himalayan peaks. Good place to indulge in your books and the quietness of a small village. Neeraj has a good knowledge about the surrounding places and very friendly and helpful. Had a very good time staying in Elation guest house. Would love to go back again.,Kiran,/Profile/sunrays07,,50
almora,"A time to aware of yourself, breath slow,  smile more,  witness the sunrise, check in to the organic farming,  savour the local food, feel the breeze, visit a village and the list go on and on. Whats unique to this guest house is that the person managing it(Neeraj) is taking care of the facility and visitors like family. You can feel absolutely safe and the best part is you can taste the local food,  visit local villages and see how they do in day to day life, he can arrange visits to many places,  a very knowledgeable person of culture, ritual, food,festival, language, music of all the kumaon region. Pretty economical too. Must visit. ",Avinash Rathore,/Profile/TravelhappyAvi,"New Delhi, India",50
