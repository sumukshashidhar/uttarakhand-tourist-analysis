almora,"Last trip was my 2nd and will keep on visiting this wonderful resort and wonderful location. Well connected from the nearby market and Ranikhet. Amenities, food and staff are just fantastic. Very good place for cycling, trekking and meditation. You can also see the wild life around the resort. Surrounded by the dense forest mostly by the pine trees. Hear whistling of pine trees, chirping of birds and orchestra of crickets whole day. Highly recommended!",Bhupen,/Profile/Bhupen0841,,50

The host took us for a trek to the mountain top which served a beautiful view of the Himalays. We enjoyed a bonfire in the evening, a happy holi with the staff and owners and got to know about experiences that everyone had.",Rajat,/Profile/Rajatka97,,50
almora,"This was our first time stay in any kind of camp/tent stay and it was simply amazing. Now onward whenever we stay in any other similar theme property then this will be the benchmark until we find something more superb then this.  The tents are huge you will get a full king size bed, a 4 seater dinning table a 2 seater sofa a bench, place to put your luggage and place to hang your coats.  The was very comfortable, the bathroom was spacious as well with hot shower and soft towels.  They serve authentic local food cooked by amazing local chef. We really like the food and local dishes which one won't find in there area.  You can go to Ranikhet or Almora  or visit Kosi Dam and some temples near by. You can also go for a 5 km track to the top of the hill and a walk to local village to",Nehajn,/Profile/Nehajn,"Bengaluru, India",50

almora,"Tanuja Sah, a native of Nainital has strived to bring comfortable yet “rustic” living close to travellers. Nayalap is a 4 large Swiss tent accommodation between Ranikhet and Almora, yet, far removed from the typical noise and congestion of Indian hill stations. I travelled with family to this pretty location in October 2019.   The tents we stayed were very comfortable with separate seating and sleeping areas. The views from our tent was gorgeous with entire Kumaon range visible from the patio.   Prem, Chandan and Basant took good care of us under the guidance of Tanuja. Homely food, vegetarian and non vegetarian, were tasty.   We took short walks to Shitlakhet market (2.3 kms) and to Haidakhan Ashram (100 metres away) during our stay.

The small but enchanting settlement called Sitlakhet is a heaven for people who are looking for solitude. And cherry on the cake was Nayalap, a camping property, sitting on a hill side, surrounded by trees n magnificent views of peaks like Nanda Devi n Trishul. The host of Nayalap is a beautiful soul Tanuja who is totally involved in everything from your welcome n  introduction to the property, your food preferences, nature walks. She so keenly introduced us to the local fruits growing wild in the hills..like Kafal, Hisaalu.  We indeed had a memorable trip to Sitlakhet.

Very co-operative staff, excellent food and the owner - Tanuja goes out of the way to make your stay memorable.

Unlike many other similar properties these tents have solid doors. They are spacious and tastefully decorated with furniture. The bathroom has all the required amenities. There are 2 options for having meals. One can either have it in their tents as nice dining table with chairs are there or can have it at their dining space which open from all sides. Staff is extremely nice and caring. Tanuja, the owner, too is extremely good and helpful. The view of the Himalayas is just wonderful from this place. There is ample car parking space too.

The size of the room was comparable to a suite and the bathroom was large and tastefully done with excellent fittings. The linens and towels were spotless. The wooden furniture in the tent reflected the owner's good taste. All the tents had wooden beds, wooden sofa, a small dining table, bed side tables, charging points, fans and a rack to keep clothes. Toilet had geyser. In short, the place did good justice to the word ""glamping"".     Just outside the tent, the mountain vistas were breathtaking.

Best part is they are away from each other privacy has been prioritized. Truly a glamping experience. Tanuja owner of the property was extremely hospitable, very helping & passionate about the cause which i highly appreciate. She tried to help us get the best possible experience given the time & situation. Food was excellent, polite staff and arrangements were very well made. Views are excellent if you wake up early morning on a clear day you can see the Himalayan range from the property itself.

Just outside our tent on the hillside were a few kaphal trees laden with berries. Had a wonderful time picking 'Kaphal' berries from the trees. There was a hammock tied between the two oak trees where I relaxed and finished my Enid Blyton's 'Five have a Wonderful Time'.  Meals were absolutely yummilicious!!!!

In the morning instead of waking up on a alarm clock the melodious song of the hill bird will gently wake you up.  Make use of the early morning hours when the birds are most active. Grab a bird book which the hosts have thoughtfully placed in your beautiful, cosy, luxury tent and spot some of the exotic hill birds. The experience of spotting the birds and identifying them is thrilling! The staff is very courteous and are always ready to cater to any of your needs. The food is simply delicious.

They have beautiful luxurious tents and awesome food (I.e. organic) which you generally dun find when you’re camping . The concept the idea is amazing ... they are helping local people by giving them employment ... that made me more interested in the place ... they treat you like you’re their kins (very homely environment) with the great blend of  Professionalism .. you have great places to hike And have lots of time to your self for reading ... looking around and knowing abt flora and fauna in and around the place ...

almora,"From the moment I was met by Tanuja (Host and Owner), I knew this was a special place. Having had the good fortune to have stayed at many wonderful places, there are 2 things that stood out on this stay. Firstly the attention to detail from the way the tents were designed and were premium experience with all modern comforts and the second point of difference was the service, somehow they got the magic blend of professionalism and friendliness just right 100% of the time.   The food was excellent and so was the entire place. It was magical, surrounded by Oak trees. The evening is so beautiful overlooking the valley and if you are lucky and the weather permits you can even see the Kumaon Himalayan range clearly during Sunrise!

Tanuja is a very warm person & very well-informed about this part of Kumaon. It was wonderful to have conversations with her & learn more about the kumaoni culture & the stories from the region. The tents are absolutely comfortable & a treat to the eyes. Every little piece of the decor is so well thought & goes with the surrounding. The property is perched on the edge of the hill with a pine & oak forest towering around. It's on the main road, so easy to reach. The views of the valley are divine. You could choose to spend a day on the hammock or have a picnic on their property while enjoying the lovely views & a glass of Chardonnay (exactly what we did).",Travelster83,/Profile/Travelster83,"New Delhi, India",50

I had planned 2 nights, extended it by a day and didnt want to leave on the 4th day too.  Tanuja is an amazing host who would be as enthusiatic as you about things you want to do while you are at nayalap. See the heritage village, go pine cone hunting, eat kumaoni food, talk endlessly, finish that bottle of wine, play with the local dogs and drive to nearby streams.

almora,"Right from the moment you spot a hand-painted welcome card tucked discreetly beside a bottle of wine on the cosy dining table inside your tent, you know there's something charming and unrushed about Nayalap. Having often roughed it out on camping journeys in the past, this happened to be our first experience of 'Glamping' and it was luxury, all right. And well, we weren't exactly complaining...  The tent, one of two on the treelined premises (with another pair being constructed on popular demand) was large, airy and built for comfort. That Tanuja and Anindya had put considerable thought into them was evident everywhere - the wooden furniture that had been tastefully chosen, the inviting double bed (with its sheep wool blankets bought from Munsiyari) meant for dreamless sleep,",uddalakg,/Profile/uddalakg,"Faridabad, India",50

Spread over a higher himalayan range view side of the hill, this is one of the few properties near Ranikhet which has tent houses with an exciting chance to glimpse the very rare herbs, fruits and birds in their natural habitat.

This place gives you a peace of mind in the middle of nature wild yet still gives you to enjoy a bit of luxury too. Currently, they have a couple of tents which are far from each other to give you privacy that you need, clean and well furnished. The camp is lost in the middle of the forest but easily accessible (don’t follow google map yet!). Anuja, the owner, is a great host and she will help you guide your way to them.

Since i travelled in Feb-March the views of the snow capped mountains were breathtaking. Also a great place to try Kumaoni cuisine like sana hua nimbu mooli, and aloo ke gutke.
